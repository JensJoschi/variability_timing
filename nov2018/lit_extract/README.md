# Content  
This folder contains the extraction of effect sizes from the original studies, and thus is the first step towards statistical analysis. The subfolder "reaction norms" contains the extracted raw data for all studies, using webPlotDigitizer for figures. The columns in these datasets are: Day length (x-axis), Percentage diapause (y-axis), and population identifier. The extracted data has been copied into the excel file in the folder lit_search (tab "extract"), and a .csv copy for analysis is found in this folder. "Varcomps.rmd" contains the MCMC estimation of mean and variance composition. "mcmcresults.txt" is the output of the estimates.
