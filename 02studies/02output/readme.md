* slopes.r: legacy Rscript, not used anymore.  
* slopes.txt: results from dose-response curve analysis. ~61 studies with ~350 populations were included, each row is one population.  
b,c,d,e: parameter estimates from analysis, b = slopes; c = lower limit (usually 0%), d = upper limit(max 100%, but less in some populations), e= critical day length (also called LD50 in analysis, xvalue were y = 50% of c:d range); b_rel etc = reliability of the estimates, 1/s.e. of the coefficients; degN, degE coordinates according to description in study.
