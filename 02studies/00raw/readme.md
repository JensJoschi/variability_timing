## Identification  
I searched the web of science database for "(photoperiodic AND (geogr* OR range)) OR (photoperiod* AND latitud*) OR(photoperiod* AND longitud*)". on 19.2.2018, This search yielded 1628 unique  results
 (savedrecs*.txt). The results were merged in an excel-file (filtered_list.xlsx).
I added articles to the study that I knew or which were cited in these articles but that did not match the keywords (total: 1638).  

## Screening  
I classified the studies as plant/animal, Vertebrate/invertebrate, water/terrestrial by using filters:
- Using the filter option, free word search for keywords such as plant,flower, ento*, fish, bird in title or journal title
- filtering the remaining by hand (according to title, abstract or full text)


## Eligibility
Concentrating on terrestrial invertebrates, I filtered studies out which do not measure photoperiodic response curves (according to fulltext), or have less than 3 populations, or less than 3 photoperiods. 61 studies (364-450 populations) remained. 

## included
I did a forward citeation search on april 3rd 2018 on all 61 eligible studies, and found 762 further articles that cite these studies. (filtering these is still on to-do list). x of these articles were suitable for analysis (). I added one further new article that was not yet on web of science, and performed another forward citation search on … In total (61+x) studies were eligible. For these, Í saved the main figure(s) in the folder "figs". 


## Table of contents  
* savedrecs*.txt is the raw data from web of science database (does not include citations that were added by hand)
* filtered_list.xlsx has all raw data merged in tab "savedrecs", added filters (vertebrate/invertebrate usable/not usable), and in tab "metadata" added metadata directly from studies (e.g. coordinates, altitude). It has one row per population (at least 3 rows per study). The tabs "pivot" and "extended" are temporary and can be deleted.
* filtered_lista.xls and liste_paper-2017-09-19 are old files and not needed anymore. 
* the subfolder figs has all main figures (and a few tables) from the included studies.

** The file filtered_list.xls is referenced in the subfolder 02studies/01extracted_data and should not be moved or renamed!**
