I searched the web of science database for "(photoperiodic AND (geogr* OR range)) OR (photoperiod* AND latitud*) OR(photoperiod* AND longitud*)". on 19.2.2018, This search yielded 1627 unique  results
 (savedrecs*.txt). The results were merged in an excel-file (filtered_list) and filtered:
- Using the filter option, and free word search for keywords such as plant,flower, ento in title or journal title
- filtering by hand  
 Í saved the main figure(s) of a subset of the studies (terrestrial invertebrates) in the folder "figs".
