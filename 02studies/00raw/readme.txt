#### Identification
I searched the web of science database for "(photoperiodic AND (geogr* OR range)) OR (photoperiod* AND latitud*) OR(photoperiod* AND longitud*)". on 19.2.2018, This search yielded 1627 unique  results
 (savedrecs*.txt). The results were merged in an excel-file (filtered_list).
I added articles to the study that I knew or which were cited in these articles but that did not match the keywords (total: 1641)


####Screening  
I classified the studies as plant/animal, Vertebrate/invertebrate, water/terrestrial by using filters:
- Using the filter option, free word search for keywords such as plant,flower, ento*, fish, bird in title or journal title
- filtering the remaining by hand (according to title, abstract or full text)


####Eligibility
Concentrating on terrestrial invertebrates, I filtered studies out which do not measure photoperiodic response curves (according to fulltext), or have less than 3 populations, or less than 3 photoperiods. 

####included
61 studies (364-450 populations) remained. For these, Í saved the main figure(s) in the folder "figs". 


###Table of contents  
* savedrecs*.txt is the raw data from web of science database (does not include citations that were added by hand)
* filtered_list.xlsx has all raw data merged in tab "savedrecs", added filters (vertebrate/invertebrate usable/not usable), and added metadata directly from studies (e.g. coordinates, altitude). It has one row per population (at least 3 rows per study)
* extended and pivot are temporary. should be deleted.
