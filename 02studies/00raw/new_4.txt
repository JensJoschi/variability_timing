However, how and why home range size varies between individuals is not well studied or understood for most species. We develop a hierarchical analytical approach-using generalized linear mixed-effects modeling of time series of home range sizes- that allows variance in home range size to be decomposed into components due to variation in temporal, spatial, and individual-level processes, also facilitating intra-and interspecific comparative analyses. We applied the approach to data from a roe deer population radiotracked in central Italy. Over multiple timescales, temporal variation is explained by photoperiod and climate and spatial variation by the distribution of habitat types and spatial variance in radio-tracking error. Differences between individuals explained a substantial amount of variance in home range size, but only a relatively minor part was explained by the individual attributes of sex and age. We conclude that the choice of temporal scale at which data are collected and the definition of home range can significantly influence biological inference. We suggest that the appropriate choice of scale and definition requires a good understanding of the ecology and life history of the study species. Our findings contrast with several common assumptions about roe deer behavior.

Effect of temperature on life history of Aprostocetus vaquitarum (Hymenoptera : Eulophidae), an egg parasitoid of Diaprepes abbreviatus (Coleoptera : Curculionidae)	BIOLOGICAL CONTROL												The effect of temperatures ranging from 5 to 40 degrees C on Aprostocetus vaquitarum Wolcott (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) oviposition and development were investigated. There were significant differences in the rate of development among the temperatures for all life stages. The egg stage lasted approximately 7 times longer at 15 than at 25 or 30 degrees C and the larval stage, consisting of 4 instars, took significantly less time at each increasing temperature from 15 to 30 degrees C. A. vaquitarum development from egg to adult took 16.3 days at 30 degrees C, significantly faster than the other temperatures tested. At 15 degrees C A. vaquitarum reached the pupal stage after a mean of 41.6 days but did not successfully complete pupation. A. vaquitarum eggs hatched on 66% of the parasitized egg masses at 35 degrees C but did not survive past the first instar. A. vaquitarum did not develop past the egg stage at 5 or 40 degrees C. Host Diaprepes abbreviatus L. (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) eggs also did not survive at temperatures of 35 and 40 degrees C on live plants. Upper and lower temperature thresholds for A. vaquitarum development were calculated to be 33.0 and 16.0 degrees C, respectively. Maximum development rate occurred at 30.9 degrees C and a thermal constant of 494.2 DD was calculated. Photoperiods ranging from 10L:14D to 16L:8D did not significantly affect development time from egg to adult at 25 degrees C. Oviposition was significantly higher at 30 degrees C than at the other temperatures tested; oviposition was also relatively high at 25 and 35 degrees C and several eggs were laid at 20 degrees C. Relatively cool winter temperatures in central Florida may be contributing to the limited range of A. vaquitarum in the state. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Immature sea bream acclimated to different salinities, i.e. SW (38 parts per thousand), LSW (5 parts per thousand) and HSW (55 parts per thousand), were kept at 18 degrees C under natural photoperiod. Arginine vasotocin (AVT) and isotocin (IT) in plasma and pituitary were determined by HPLC. Plasma melatonin (Mel) was assayed by RIA. Plasma osmolality, ion concentrations (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Cl-) and Na+,K+-ATPase activity in gill were measured. A steady increase in plasma AVT, along with increasing water salinity was observed. Pituitary IT concentration in HSW-acclimated fish was significantly higher than that in LSW group. AVT/IT secretory system of sea bream does appear to be involved in the mechanism of long-term acclimation to different salinities. The distinct roles and control mechanisms of both nonapeptides are suggested. Plasma Mel was significantly higher in LSW compared with both HSW and SW groups. Data indicate that the changes in Met level are linked to osmoregulation. Further studies are required to elucidate a complex role of AVT, IT and Mel in sea bream osmoregulation.

J	Johansen, TJ; Meadow, R				Johansen, Tor J.; Meadow, Richard			Population differences in emergence of Brassica root flies (Diptera : Anthomyiidae)	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												Accurate timing of pest control measures requires a good understanding of the emergence pattern of the specific pest populations. In 1999-2000, pupae of the cabbage maggot, Delia radicum L., and the turnip maggot, D. floralis Fallen, were collected in the autumn from nine widespread locations in Norway (58-70 degrees N). After diapause development during winter, emergence was studied in a climate chamber at 18 degrees C. The time to 50% emergence was < 2 wk for all populations of D. radicum, and the emergence period (time elapsed between 10 and 90% emergence) was similar to 4 d on average. The results indicated uniform and early emerging populations of this species. D. floralis, however, had much later emergence, with a wide range of emerging biotypes. The time to 50% emergence of D.floralis varied from 5 to 10 wk between populations. Moreover, the emergence period varied between 2 and 7 wk for the different populations, indicating mixtures of differently emerging biotypes. The ecological basis for the diverging emergence patterns is discussed.																	0046-225X					OCT	2006	35	5					1161	1165		10.1603/0046-225X(2006)35[1161:PDIEOB]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000241170600003

Growth management of vetiver (Vetiveria zizanioides) under Mediterranean conditions	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												In spite of the advantages of Vetiver grass in light of environmental aspects, this plant is not used in the Mediterranean region. The objectives of the present study were: (i) to elucidate growth parameters and establishment of Vetiver under Mediterranean conditions suitable for its various environmental applications; and (ii) to develop management practices for growing vetiver under Mediterranean conditions. In greenhouse experiments conducted under controlled conditions it was found that, in general, increasing the minimum/maximum temperatures to 21-29 degrees C significantly increased plant height. In the Mediterranean region, this range of air temperatures is obtained mainly during the summer, from June to September. For air temperatures up to 15-23 degrees C the effect of day length on plant height was insignificant, whereas in air temperature > 15-23 degrees C, the plant heights under long day conditions were significantly higher than under short day. The number of sprouts per plant increased exponentially with increasing air temperature, and was not significantly affected by the day length at any air temperature range. In open fields, the heights of irrigated vetiver plants were significantly higher than those of rain-fed plants. It was concluded that, once they were established, vetiver plants could survive the dry slimmer of the Mediterranean region under rain-fed conditions, but they would be shorter than under irrigation. Cutting or burning of the plant foliage during the spring did not improve the survival of vetiver during the dry summer. In order to obtain fast growth of vetiver and to increase the possibility of its using the rainwater, the plants should be planted in the winter, during February and March. However, under this regime, the vetiver plant cannot be used as a soil stabilizer during the first winter, because the plant is still small. In contrast, under irrigation it is advantageous to plant vetiver at the beginning of the summer; the plant then has sufficient time to grow and develop before the beginning of the winter, so that its effect as a soil stabilizer in the following wet winter could be maximal. It was found that vetiver could grow in a wide range of substrates, such as: sandy soil, loamy sand, clay soil, crushed limestone, sandy clay loam, and tuff/peat mixture. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Morera, AL; Abreu, P				Morera, A. L.; Abreu, P.			Seasonality of psychopathology and circannual melatonin rhythm	JOURNAL OF PINEAL RESEARCH												The association of seasonal changes in health and disease has been known for centuries. The prevalence of psychopathological symptoms with seasonal fluctuations and the use of melatonin as a biological marker of circadian and circannual rhythms is well documented. The aim of this work was to study the variability of melatonin secretion between summer and winter in our geographical area (28 degrees N, 16 degrees W) and relate the changes to the level of psychopathology. Ten drug-free, nonsmoker, healthy subjects were studied in summer (August) and winter (December). Blood samples for melatonin assays were collected every hour at night for 5 hr, from 22:00 to 02:00 hr, and next day at noon. Melatonin was assayed by an ELISA technique. Psychopathology was evaluated by means of the 28-item version of the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28). All subjects had a circadian rhythm of melatonin secretion in summer and winter. There was a seasonal rhythm with melatonin levels being significantly higher at night in winter than in summer. Melatonin levels at 22:00, 23:00, 24:00 and 01:00 hr and mean melatonin area under the curve (AUC) were significantly higher in winter than in summer. Melatonin AUC increased 80% in winter compared with summer. The GHQ-28 somatic and anxiety subscales and the total GHQ-28 score were significantly higher in winter than summer. Psychopathology scores were significantly and negatively correlated with melatonin production in summer and winter. Our data strongly suggest that melatonin production and psychopathology levels present seasonal fluctuations and these variations should be taken into account when conducting research in this field.

Genetic diversity and diapause variation of native and introduced Rhagoletis completa populations	OECOLOGIA												The success of invasive species appears to be a paradox: despite experiencing strong population bottlenecks, invasive species are able to successfully establish in new environments. We studied how the walnut husk fly, Rhagoletis completa, was able to successfully colonize California from the Midwestern United States, by examining genetic diversity and diapause variation of native and introduced fly populations. Climate plays an important role in the successful establishment of introduced insects, because insect diapause is highly dependent upon external climatic conditions. We examined if: (1) fly populations show signs of a population bottleneck, (2) native and introduced flies differ in diapause length when exposed to California and Midwestern climatic conditions, and (3) population genetic diversity is related to variation in diapause length. We assessed if fly diapause conformed more to a model of establishment by local adaptation or to a model of a highly plastic "general-purpose genotype". Our results indicate that only two populations close to the original introduced location showed signs of a population bottleneck, and native and introduced populations did not differ in genetic diversity. Genetic diversity increased in the northern introduced populations, suggesting that multiple introductions have occurred. Flies emerged about 2 weeks earlier under the Midwestern treatment than the California treatment, and introduced flies emerged about a week earlier than native flies. All flies emerged when walnuts are typically available in California. Although variance in diapause length differed between populations, it did not vary between populations or regions. Furthermore, genetic diversity was not associated with diapause variation. Therefore, multiple introductions and a "general-purpose genotype" appear to have facilitated the fly's invasion into California.

J	Knox, KJE; Clarke, PJ				Knox, K. J. E.; Clarke, P. J.			Fire season and intensity affect shrub recruitment in temperate sclerophyllous woodlands	OECOLOGIA												The season in which a fire occurs may regulate plant seedling recruitment because of: (1) the interaction of season and intensity of fire and the temperature requirements for seed release, germination and growth; (2) post-fire rainfall and temperature patterns affecting germination; (3) the interaction of post-fire germination conditions and competition from surrounding vegetation; and (4) the interaction of post-fire germination conditions and seed predators and/or seedling herbivores. This study examined the effects of different fire intensities and fire seasons on the emergence and survival of shrubs representing a range of fire response syndromes from a summer rainfall cool climate region. Replicated experimental burns were conducted in two seasons (spring and autumn) in 2 consecutive years and fuel loads were increased to examine the effects of fire intensity (low intensity and moderate intensity). Post-fire watering treatments partitioned the effects of seasonal temperature from soil moisture. Higher intensity fires resulted in enhanced seedling emergence for hard-seeded species but rarely influenced survival. Spring fires enhanced seedling emergence across all functional groups. Reduced autumn recruitment was related to seasonal temperature inhibiting germination rather than a lack of soil moisture or competition. In Mediterranean-type climate regions, seedling emergence has been related to post-fire rainfall and exposure of seeds to seed predators. We think a similar model may operate in temperate summer rainfall regions where cold-induced dormancy over winter exposes seeds to predators for a longer time and subsequently results in recruitment failure. Our results support the theory that the effect of fire season is more predictable where there are strong seasonal patterns in climate. In this study seasonal temperature rather than rainfall appears to be more influential.

Complete excavation and mapping of a Texas leakutting ant nest	ANNALS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												A medium-sized nest of the Texas leafcutting ant, Atta texana (Buckley), in northern Louisiana was excavated completely, and a three-dimensional model of its external and subterranean features was constructed. In total, 97 fungus gardens, 27 dormancy cavities, and 45 detritus cavities were located. At the lower center of the funnel-shaped nest was a large central cavity, which in winter functions as a domicile for the colony and where the alate brood is reared. Vertical tunnels, possibly as deep as 32 in, may serve as wells leading to the water table. Winter mean annual temperatures within the central cavity may limit the northern geographical range of A. texana to approximate to 33 degrees N latitude. The inquilines Attaphila fungicola Wheeler, Pholeomyia comans Sabrosky, Ceuthophilm sp., Lobopoda subcuneatus Campbell, Geomysaprinus nr. formicus (Hinton), species of Aleocharinae, and a species of Annelida were seen in nest cavities and galleries.																	0013-8746					SEP	2006	99	5					891	897		10.1603/0013-8746(2006)99[891:CEAMOA]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000240607100019

The results expand the documented range of Bythotrephes in Minnesota from Lake Superior, Island Lake, and Saganaga Lake to Flour Lake, Greenwood Lake, McFarland Lake, Pine Lake, and Caribou Lake as well as to Saganagons Lake in Ontario. The latter three lakes are located in roadless landscapes without motorized boat access. Results confirm that Bythotrephes is no longer present in Boulder Lake or Fish Lake (St. Louis County, Minnesota), providing the first evidence of range compression (extinction following introduction) of this species in North America. Distributional expansion was confined to a corridor along the international border between northeast Minnesota and Ontario. Lakes along the invasion corridor were deeper, more transparent, and had lower chlorophyll concentration, on average, compared to other lakes studied. The pattern of range expansion provided an opportunity to test the predictions of a forecasting model for Bythotrephes occurrence (MacIsaac et al. 2000 Archiv fur Hydrobiologie 149: 1-21) based on habitat characteristics. The model predicted 51% of the surveyed inland lakes to be susceptible to invasion, however, only 13% were actually invaded, implying strong dispersal constraints. Application of the forecasting model to a broader set of 179 Minnesota lakes predicted that 41% may be vulnerable to establishment by Bythotrephes based on habitat characteristics, offering an estimate of the state's overall lake susceptibility (i.e., fundamental niche) to invasion. The results of this study provide evidence for the importance of a low-light refuge where Bythotrephes can minimize vulnerability to fish predation as a key habitat feature not considered by the forecasting model.																	1387-3547	1573-1464				SEP	2006	8	6					1367	1379		10.1007/s10530-005-5278-7								WOS:000241377700015

Information on the reproductive biology of M. quadrilineatus was gathered in order to produce sufficient quantities of the weevil and L. franki for biological and non-target testing studies. Longevity, fecundity, and egg viability of M quadrilineatus females on Catopsis hahnii (Baker) were studied under laboratory conditions at 21 degrees C temperature, 70% relative humidity, and a 12 : 12 hr light:dark photoperiod.

Global warming and excess nitrogen may induce butterfly decline by microclimatic cooling	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Global warming may explain the current poleward shift of species distributions. However, paradoxically, climatic warming can lead to microclimatic cooling in spring by advancing plant growth, an effect worsened by excess nitrogen. We suggest that spring-developing but thermophilous organisms, such as butterflies hibernating as egg or larva, are particularly sensitive to the cooling of microclimates. Using published data on butterfly trends in distribution, we report a comparatively greater decline in egg-larva hibernators in European countries with oceanic climates and high nitrogen deposition, which supports this explanation. Furthermore, trends in abundance from a nationwide butterfly monitoring scheme reveal a 63% decrease over 13 years (1992-2004) for egg-larva hibernators in the Netherlands, contrasting with a nonsignificant trend in adult-pupa hibernators. This evidence supports the hypothesis that these environmental changes pose new threats to spring-developing, thermophilous species. We underline the threat of climate change to biodiversity, as previously suggested on the basis of mobility, habitat fragmentation and evolutionary adaptation, but we here emphasize a different ecological axis of change in habitat quality.																	1354-1013					SEP	2006	12	9					1620	1626		10.1111/j.1365-2486.2006.01202.x								WOS:000240005300004

Scott	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 This account reviews information on all aspects of the biology of Sarcocornia perennis that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history, and conservation. 2 Sarcocornia perennis (Miller) A.J. Scott (Salicornia perennis Miller; Salicornia radicans Sm.; Arthrocnemum [Arthrocnemon] perenne (Miller) Moss) of the European and African coasts is now considered also to include Salicornia virginica L., S. ambigua Michx. and S. gaudichaudiana Moq. of the Americas. Sarcocornia perennis is a spreading, jointed-stemmed, halophyte that differs from the closely related Salicornia in being a shrubby perennial and in aspects of inflorescence structure. In Britain, it is found mainly on the coasts of south-east England, on gravelly or sandy foreshores, and well-drained sediments of tidal salt marshes. 3 Sarcocornia perennis occurs relatively low in the tidal frame but only in well-drained situations, as seedling establishment and long-term survival are intolerant of highly reducing surface sediments. It has a role in the early stages of salt-marsh succession, sometimes as the primary colonist on sandy substrates. In southern Europe, its invasion may be facilitated by the raised clonal tussocks of Spartina maritima, a primary colonist; subsequently, S. perennis dominates the tussocks and supports their rapid radial and upward growth by trapping silt. Pollen flow from the high marsh species Sarcocornia fruticosa may allow invasion by hybrids between the two species. 4 Hybridization between the diploid S. perennis and octaploid S. fruticosa in south-west Spain has been confirmed by analysis of random amplified DNA (RAPDs). This has also clarified the relationship between the two subspecies present there (the widely distributed ssp. perennis and the more upright, rigid Iberian endemic ssp. alpini (Lag.) Castroviejo). 5 Sarcocornia perennis maintains low water potentials and a positive carbon balance under highly saline conditions. Salinity treatment had no effect on the efficiency of Photosystem II (Fv/Fm). Total germination was also unaffected by salinity up to 2%, although above this it was progressively inhibited; the reduction in germination at seawater concentrations was mainly osmotically enforced dormancy, which would promote dispersal by tides and currents.

Annual pattern of plasma melatonin and progesterone concentrations in hair and wool ewe lambs kept under natural photoperiod at lower latitudes in the southern hemisphere	JOURNAL OF PINEAL RESEARCH												To study the annual pattern of plasma melatonin and progesterone concentrations in hair [Santa Ines (SI)] and wool [Romney Marsh (RM) and Suffolk (SU)] ewe lambs kept under natural photoperiods at 21 degrees 59'S, 12 ewe lambs (four/breed) were used. For melatonin, blood samples were collected monthly throughout the year at the onset (17:00, 19:00 and 21:00 hr) and end (04:00, 06:00 and 08:00 hr) of the night, and for progesterone the samples were collected in the morning, two to three times a week throughout the year. Plasma melatonin concentrations at different times of the day changed according to the season. In diurnal periods (17:00 and 8:00 hr) no seasonal differences were observed but they became evident in the nocturnal intervals (21:00 and 4:00 hr) and transitional night-day (6:00 hr) times. The patterns of melatonin secretion were higher in winter and autumn than in spring and summer. The patterns of plasma progesterone secretion were affected by interaction between breed and season. There was no seasonal variation in plasma progesterone concentrations for SI females. The progesterone pattern for RM and SU females varied with season. The plasma levels were higher in autumn and winter than in spring and summer. At 21 degrees 59'S hair and wool ewe lambs showed the same annual pattern of plasma melatonin concentration while the annual progesterone profiles were quite different. For SI females this pattern was constant along all seasons and for RM and SU females this pattern was higher during autumn and winter than spring and summer.

Temperatures in Poland were significantly colder than in the UK for February and March and significantly warmer in May. Mean first flowering dates of both species were not significantly different between the 2 countries. However, records in the UK were significantly more variable. Both species in both locations showed significant temperature responsiveness although plants in the UK were more responsive than those in Poland. We conclude that locally adapted species may differ in their projected change under future climate warming.

J	Putra, NS; Yasuda, H				Putra, Nugroho Susetya; Yasuda, Hironori			Effects of prey species and its density on larval performance of two species of hoverfly larvae, Episyrphus balteatus de Geer and Eupeodes corollae Fabricius (Diptera : Syrphidae)	APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY												Functional response and effects of prey species, Acyrfosiphon pisum (Harris) and Aphis craccivora Koch, and its density on larval performance such as survival rate and development time in addition to adult weight gain of the two predatory hoverflies, Episyrphus balteatus de Geer and Eupeodes corollae Fabricius, were examined in the laboratory. Our study revealed that prey density positively influences larval performance and the adult weight of the two hoverfly species. However, the effects of prey species on survival rate and development time differed: A. pisum was better food for E. balteatus, while the larval performance of E. corollae was enhanced by A. craccivora. In addition, the effect of prey density differed with development stage, since voracity increased with larval development. Both hoverfly species tended to eat a larger number of preys with lower quality, which in turn resulted in lower performance. The functional response differed between species involved and among development stages. During the third-instar stage, both species showed linear relationships as a functional response, while Holling's Type II response was observed during the young instar phase. E. balteatus tended to have linear relationships than E. corollae, and this would be caused by the larger size of E. balteatus, which in turn consumed more aphids than did E. corollae. This study suggests that the differences in the effects of prey species and its density on the larval performance of the two hoverflies, are attributable to the differences in the range of food habit and body size.																	0003-6862					AUG	2006	41	3					389	397		10.1303/aez.2006.389								WOS:000241342100002						
J	Raven, JA; Cockell, CS				Raven, J. A.; Cockell, C. S.			Influence on photosynthesis of starlight, moonlight, planetlight, and light pollution (reflections on photosynthetically active radiation in the universe)	ASTROBIOLOGY												Photosynthesis on Earth can occur in a diversity of organisms in the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) range of 10 nmol of photons m(-2) s(-1) to 8 mmol of photons m(-2) s(-1). Similar considerations would probably apply to photosynthetic organisms on Earth-like planets (ELPs) in the continuously habitable zone of other stars. On Earth, starlight PAR is inadequate for photosynthetically supported growth. An increase in starlight even to reach the minimum theoretical levels to allow for photosynthesis would require a universe that was approximately ten million times older, or with a ten million times greater density of stars, than is the case for the present universe. Photosynthesis on an ELP using PAR reflected from a natural satellite with the same size as our Moon, but at the Roche limit, could support a low rate of photosynthesis at full Moon. Photosynthesis on an ELP-like satellite of a Jupiter-sized planet using light reflected from the planet could be almost 1% of the rate in full sunlight on Earth when the planet was full. These potential contributions to photosynthesis require that the contribution is compared with the rate of photosynthesis driven by direct radiation from the star. Light pollution on Earth only energizes photosynthesis by organisms that are very close to the light source. However, effects of light pollution on photosynthesis can be more widespread if the photosynthetic canopy is retained for more of the year, caused by effects on photoperiodism, with implications for the influence of civilizations on photosynthesis.																	1531-1074	1557-8070				AUG	2006	6	4					668	675		10.1089/ast.2006.6.668								WOS:000240070800012	16916290

Nutritional condition of Pacific Black Brant wintering at the extremes of their range	CONDOR												Endogenous stores of energy allow birds to survive periods of severe weather and food shortage during winter. We documented changes in lipid, protein, moisture, and ash in body tissues of adult female Pacific Black Brant (Branta bernicla nigricans) and modeled the energetic costs of wintering. Birds were collected at the extremes of their winter range, in Alaska and Baja California, Mexico. Body lipids decreased over winter for birds in Alaska but increased for those in Baja California. Conversely, body protein increased over winter for Brant in Alaska and remained stable for birds in Baja California. Lipid stores likely fuel migration for Brant wintering in Baja California and ensure winter survival for those in Alaska. Increases in body protein may support earlier reproduction for Brant in Alaska. Predicted energy demands were similar between sites during late winter but avenues of expenditure were different. Birds in Baja California spent more energy on lipid synthesis while those in Alaska incurred higher thermoregulatory costs. Estimated daily intake rates of eelgrass were similar between sites in early winter; however, feeding time was more constrained in Alaska because of high tides and short photoperiods. Despite differences in energetic costs and foraging time, Brant wintering at both sites appeared to be in good condition. We suggest that wintering in Alaska may be more advantageous than long-distance migration if winter survival is similar between sites and constraints on foraging time do not impair body condition.																	0010-5422					AUG	2006	108	3					678	690		10.1650/0010-5422(2006)108[678:NCOPBB]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000239827500016						
J	Schmidt, PS; Conde, DR				Schmidt, Paul S.; Conde, Daphne R.			Environmental heterogeneity and the maintenance of genetic variation for reproductive diapause in Drosophila melanogaster	EVOLUTION												Drosophila melanogaster has colonized temperate habitats on multiple continents over a historical time period, and many traits vary predictably with latitude. Despite considerable attention paid to clinal variation in Drosophila, the mechanisms generating such patterns in nature remain largely unidentified. In D. melanogaster, the expression of reproductive diapause can be induced by exposure to low temperatures and shortened photoperiods. Both diapause expression itself and the underlying genetic variance for diapause expression have widespread impacts on organismal fitness, and diapause incidence exhibits a 60% cline in frequency in the eastern United States. The major aim of this study was to evaluate whether the relative fitness of diapause and nondiapause genotypes varies predictably with environment. In experimental population cages in the laboratory, the frequency of genotypes that express diapause increased over time when flies were exposed to environmental stress, whereas the frequency of nondiapause genotypes increased when flies were cultured under benign control conditions. Other fitness traits correlated with the genetic variance for diapause expression (longevity, mortality rates, stress resistance, lipid content, preadult viability, fecundity profiles, and development time) also diverged between experimental treatments. Similarly, sampling of isofemale lines from natural populations revealed that the frequency of diapause incidence cycled over time in seasonal habitats: diapause expression was at high frequency following the winter season and subsequently declined throughout the summer months. In contrast, diapause expression was low and temporally homogeneous in isofemale line collections from human-associated urban habitats. These data suggest that genetic variation underlying the diapause-nondiapause dichotomy may be actively maintained by selection pressures that vary spatially and temporally in natural populations.																	0014-3820					AUG	2006	60	8					1602	1611		10.1554/05-430.1								WOS:000240530300008	17017061

A more general aim is to assess the impact of fire as a natural factor influencing the vegetation of the southern slopes of the Alps. Locations: Alps, southern Switzerland. Methods: Presence-absence data to fit the model were obtained from the most recent field mapping of C. salviifolius. The quantitative environmental predictors used in this study include topographic, climatic and disturbance (fire) predictors. Models were fitted by logistic regression and evaluated by jackknife and bootstrap approaches. Changes in fire regime were simulated by increasing the time-return interval of fire (simulating longer periods without fire). Two scenarios were considered: no fire in the past 15 years; or in the past 35 years. Results: Rock cover, slope, topographic position, potential evapotranspiration and time elapsed since the last fire were selected in the final model. The Nagelkerke R-2 of the model for C. salviifolius was 0.57 and the Jackknife area under the curve evaluation was 0.89. The bootstrap evaluation revealed model robustness. By increasing the return interval of fire by either up to 15 years, or 35 years, the modelled C. salviifolius population declined by 30-40%, respectively. Main conclusions: Although fire plays a significant role, topography and rock cover appear to be the most important predictors, suggesting that the distribution of C. salviifolius in the southern Swiss Alps is closely related to the availability of supposedly competition-free sites, such as emerging bedrock, ridge locations or steep slopes. Fire is more likely to play a secondary role in allowing C. salviifolius to extend its occurrence temporarily, by increasing germination rates and reducing the competition from surrounding vegetation. To maintain a viable dormant seed bank for C. salviifolius, conservation managers should consider carrying out vegetation clearing and managing wild fire propagation to reduce competition and ensure sufficient recruitment for this species.

Measurements of leaf area index (LAI), soil moisture and temperature, runoff, soil carbon (C), and soil respiration (R) were also compared with model output. An experimental approach was designed to help attribute model errors to the vegetation dynamics and phenology formulations versus simulated biological processes. Continental scale phenology sub-models poorly represented the timing of budburst and evolution of canopy LAI in deciduous forests. Biases of vegetation green-up of 6 weeks and delayed senescence were noted. Simulated soil temperatures were overestimated (underestimated) during the summer (winter) on average by 2-5 degrees C. Ecosystem R was overestimated during the growing season, on average, by 20-60 g C m(-2) month(-1), and underestimated during the winter by 10-20 g C m(-2) month(-1) at all sites. Simulated soil R failed to capture observed mid-summer peak rates and was generally lower than observed in winter. The overall comparison of simulated net ecosystem production (NEP) to observations showed a significant underestimate of growing season NEP of 25-100gCm(-2) month(-1), and an overall positive bias of 10-40 g C m(-2) month(-1) during the winter. Excellent agreement between annual average NEP observations and IBIS simulations in "fixed vegetation" mode resulted from offsetting seasonal model biases. The magnitude of simulated variation in seasonal and inter-annual C exchange was generally dampened with respect to observations. The parameterization, and in some cases the formulations (e.g., ecosystem R and phenology) limited model capacity to capture the seasonal fluctuations of C and water exchange. Model parameterizations and formulations were originally constrained and generalized for application to a wide range of global climate and soil conditions and plant functional types (PFTs), likely contributing to model biases. This problem potentially applies to other DGVMs and biosphere models, and will likely become increasingly relevant if investigators apply their models at higher spatial resolution. We suggest that revisions to DGVMs should focus on advancing the capabilities of current phenology formulations to account for photoperiod, soil moisture and frost in addition to temperature. Model representations of PFTs and formulations of ecosystem R need to be rethought, particularly with respect to use of Q(10) temperature functions as modifiers. Surface energy balance, C allocation, soil R, and plant response to nutrient stress deserve attention as well.

J	Xiao, HJ; Yang, D; Xue, FS				Xiao, Hai-Jun; Yang, Dong; Xue, Fang-Sen			Effect of photoperiod on the duration of summer and winter diapause in the cabbage butterfly, Pieris melete (Lepidoptera : Pieridae)	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY												Effect of photoperiod on the duration of summer and winter diapause was investigated in the cabbage butterfly, Pieris melete. By keeping naturally induced aestivating and hibernating pupae under various photoperiods, it was shown that diapause duration of aestivating pupae was significantly longer at long than at short daylengths, whereas diapause duration of hibernating pupae was significantly shorter at long than at short daylengths, Suggesting both aestivating and hibernating pupae require opposite photoperiodic signals to promote diapause development. By transferring diapausing pupae, induced under various photoperiods, to 20 degrees C with a naturally changing summer daylength, the diapause induced by short daylengths was easier to terminate than diapause induced by long daylengths. When naturally induced aestivating and hibernating pupae were kept under natural conditions, aestivating pupae had a long diapause (mean 155 days) and wide range of emergence (90 days), whereas hibernating pupae had a short diapause (mean 105 days) and a relatively synchronized emergence (lasted 30 days). Finally, the ecological significance of photoperiodic regulation of diapause duration is discussed.																	1210-5759					JUL 3	2006	103	3					537	540		10.14411/eje.2006.071								WOS:000239752400005

Chaotic dynamics can select for long-term dormancy	AMERICAN NATURALIST												Extended dormancy in a population is evolutionarily costly unless some variance in season-to-season fitness (usually driven by variance in environmental quality) makes bet hedging useful. Consequently, dormancy in a population is usually accepted as evidence of environmental variance. Using a Ricker-type model with heritable variation in dormancy, we show that this need not be so. Intrinsic population dynamics can generate chaotic fluctuations in the absence of environmental variance. Chaotic dynamics increase the frequency of a range of dormant strategists under natural selection, even when mortality during dormancy is relatively high. The buffering effect of dormant individuals then eliminates chaotic dynamics or generates periodic orbits of relatively low amplitude. These stabilized populations harbor a high frequency of dormant individuals that express a range of propensities to enter dormancy.																	0003-0147					JUL	2006	168	1					127	131		10.1086/505155								WOS:000239040800012	16874620					
J	Richardson, AD; Bailey, AS; Denny, EG; Martin, CW; O'Keefe, J				Richardson, AD; Bailey, AS; Denny, EG; Martin, CW; O'Keefe, J			Phenology of a northern hardwood forest canopy	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												While commonplace in other parts of the world, long-term and ongoing observations of the phenology of native tree species are rare in North America. We use 14 years of field survey data from the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest to fit simple models of canopy phenology for three northern hardwood species, sugar maple (Acer saccharum), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis). These models are then run with historical meteorological data to investigate potential climate change effects on phenology. Development and senescence are quantified using an index that ranges from 0 (dormant, no leaves) to 4 (full, green canopy). Sugar maple is the first species to leaf out in the spring, whereas American beech is the last species to drop its leaves in the fall. Across an elevational range from 250 to 825 m ASL, the onset of spring is delayed by 2.7 +/- 0.4 days for every 100 m increase in elevation, which is in reasonable agreement with Hopkin's law. More than 90% of the variation in spring canopy development, and just slightly less than 90% of the variation in autumn canopy senescence, is accounted for by a logistic model based on accumulated degree-days. However, degree-day based models fit to Hubbard Brook data appear to overestimate the rate at which spring development occurs at the more southerly Harvard Forest. Autumn senescence at the Harvard Forest can be predicted with reasonable accuracy in sugar maple but not American beech. Retrospective modeling using five decades (1957-2004) of Hubbard Brook daily mean temperature data suggests significant trends (P <= 0.05) towards an earlier spring (e.g. sugar maple, rate of change=0.18 days earlier/yr), consistent with other studies documenting measurable climate change effects on the onset of spring in both North America and Europe. Our results also suggest that green canopy duration has increased by about 10 days (e.g. sugar maple, rate of change=0.21 days longer/yr) over the period of study.

J	Fontaneto, D; Ricci, C				Fontaneto, Diego; Ricci, Claudia			Spatial gradients in species diversity of microscopic animals: the case of bdelloid rotifers at high altitude	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim Organisms smaller than 2 mm appear not to follow the spatial patterns in richness and diversity commonly observed in macroscopic organisms. We describe spatial patterns in species diversity in a group of microscopic organisms, bdelloid rotifers, living in moss and lichen patches, in order to test the hypotheses of no relationship between species richness and composition and spatial gradients, suggested by previously published patterns in microscopic organisms. Location Moss and lichen patches as habitats for bdelloids, on high-elevation peaks at altitudes between 2984 and 4527 m a.s.l. across the Italian, French and Swiss Alps, with distances among sample sites ranging from 1 m to 420 km, in comparison with lower-elevation samples at altitudes from 850 to 1810 m a.s.l. Methods We sampled species assemblages of bdelloid rotifers living in isolated moss and lichen patches in 47 sites. We described the observed alpha, beta and gamma diversities; the heterogeneity of species assemblages; and the estimated number of species (incidence-based coverage estimator). Patterns in species distribution were analysed at three different levels: (1) habitat, comparing species richness on moss and lichen substrates, testing differences in alpha diversity and heterogeneity (ANOVA), species composition (analysis of similarities test), and gamma diversity (rarefaction curves); (2) altitude, comparing the observed richness with previously published data from locations well below 2000 m; and (3) distances between sites, correlating the matrix of Jaccard dissimilarities and the matrix of geographical distances with a Mantel test. Results Both species richness and species composition of bdelloid rotifers differed significantly between mosses and lichens at high elevations, but no difference was found in the heterogeneity of species assemblages. Alpha diversity was significantly lower at high-elevation than at low-elevation sites, but the estimated number of species was not reduced when compared with sites at low elevations. Geographical distance between sites had no effect on species composition in either mosses or lichens. The distribution of species was highly heterogeneous, with a low similarity among assemblages. Main conclusion As expected, bdelloids appear to occupy habitats selectively. The altitudinal gradient in species richness for bdelloid rotifers is limited to a decrease in alpha diversity only; such a decrease is not caused by a lower number of species (low gamma diversity) being able to tolerate harsh conditions, and high-altitude species are not a subset of species living at lower elevations. The observed values of alpha, beta and gamma diversity at high altitudes in the Alps are compatible with the scenario of a very low number of available propagules because of the low density of patches of favourable habitat. Our results suggest that the geographical distribution of animals, and therefore biodiversity patterns, may be strongly influenced by animal size, as small organisms such as bdelloids appear to show spatial patterns that differ from those known in larger animals. Differences in body size should be taken into account carefully in future studies of biodiversity patterns.

Stress responses in tropical sparrows: Comparing tropical and temperate Zonotrichia	PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL ZOOLOGY												Seasonal modulation of the adrenocortical response appears to be ubiquitous in mid- to high- latitude vertebrates but has not been investigated in tropical vertebrates. Previous studies demonstrate that temperate passerines show seasonality in corticosterone secretion and corticosteroid binding globulin capacities. We examined seasonal and sex differences in the stress response in an equatorial population of Zonotrichia capensis, the only Zonotrichia that breeds in the tropics, and compared the results with those of northern Zonotrichia. Seasonal differences in tropical Zonotrichia would presumably be independent of photoperiod and thus directly related to such activities as reproduction and feather molt. In addition, we investigated the possible role of binding globulin as a sex steroid binding globulin, as suggested for temperate passerines. Similar to northern congeners, Z. capensis show seasonal modulation in total corticosterone and binding globulin capacity with higher levels during breeding than molt. However, unlike many temperate passerines, there are no sex differences in corticosterone secretion or binding globulin capacity. Furthermore, the seasonal differences in total corticosterone diminish when the free levels are calculated. The contrast between equatorial and northern congeners indicates factors such as breeding environment and life-history strategy may play important roles in shaping stress response in these species.

The maximum adsorption capacity (Q(max)) to remove these metal ions by the alkali and CaCl(2)/MgCl(2)/NaCl (2: 1: 1, molar ratio) activated Azolla from 283 to 313 K was 1.431-1.272, 1.173-0.990, 1.365-1.198 and 1.291-0.981 mmol/g dry biomass, respectively. Q(max) to remove these heavy metals by the non-activated Azolla at the mentioned temperature range was obtained 1.131-0.977, 1.092-0.921, 1.212-0.931 and 1.103-0.923 mmol/g dry biomass, respectively. In order to remove these metal ions by the activated Azolla, the enthalpy change (Delta H) was -4.403, -4.495, -4.557 and -4.365 kcal/mol and the entropy change (AS) was 2.290, 1.268, 1.745 and 1.006 cal/mol K, respectively. While, to remove these metal ions by the non-activated Azolla, Delta H was -3.685, -3.766, -3.967 and -3.731 kcal/mol and AS was 2.440, 1.265, 1.036 and 0.933 cal/mol K, respectively. On the other hand, the living Azolla removed these heavy metals corresponding to first-order kinetic model. It was also shown that pH, temperature and photoperiod were effective both on the rate of Azolla growth and the rate of heavy metals uptake during 10 days. It was appeared the use of Ca(NO(3))(2) increased both Azolla growth rate and the rate of heavy metals uptake while the using KNO(3) although increased Azolla growth rate but decreased the rate of heavy metals uptake.

Metamasius callizona (Coleoptera : Dryophthoridae): Longevity and fecundity in the laboratory	FLORIDA ENTOMOLOGIST												Metamasius callizona (Chevrolat) is native to southern Mexico and Guatemala. It was detected in Broward County, Florida, in 1989 and has spread to 20 counties in southern Florida, where it devastates populations of native epiphytic bromeliads and also attacks cultivated bromeliads. Larvae mine into stems of larger bromeliads, killing them. New data were obtained at approximate to 25 degrees C and a photoperiod of 14:10 L:D to optimize cultures of this insect to serve as hosts for the production of biological control agents. After pairing with males, it took an average of 28.9 d (+/- 17.8, range 8-89 d) for females to begin laying eggs; thereafter, each female laid eggs for the remainder of her life, or within just a few days of her death. The total duration of life of 75 ovipositing females averaged 156.4 d (+/- 96.7, range 26-387 d); their lifetime egg production averaged 39.6 eggs (+/- 40.0, range 2-188 eggs).																	0015-4040	1938-5102				JUN	2006	89	2					208	211		10.1653/0015-4040(2006)89[208:MCCDLA]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000238771000015						
J	Suwa, A; Gotoh, T				Suwa, A; Gotoh, T			Geographic variation in diapause induction and mode of diapause inheritance in Tetranychus pueraricola	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY												Diapause induction and photoperiodic response curves were determined for 33 strains of Tetranychus pueraricola derived from kudzu vine at three constant temperatures (15, 18 and 20 degrees C) under a short-day condition (10 : 14 h; light : dark). Females of all but one of the strains entered diapause at all three temperatures with little variation in diapause percentages among the strains. The exception was the southernmost strain, which was found to be a non-diapause (ND) strain. The critical photoperiod gradually decreased towards the south at a rate of about 1 h for each 5 degrees of latitude. The diapause strains (D1 and D2) exhibited 100% diapause, whereas the ND strain exhibited 0% diapause. By crossing these strains, we determined that 'non-diapause' was a dominant character over 'diapause' and the character was controlled by simple Mendelian inheritance. To clarify why the female progeny from the crosses between the D1 and ND strains did not segregate into the diapause and non-diapause phenotypes in a 1:1 ratio in the B-1 generation, round-robin crosses were carried out among the three strains. The results showed that the F-1 generation was reproductively compatible and showed high egg hatchability with a female-biased sex ratio. In the B-1 generation, the crosses between the D1 and ND strains and between the D1 and D2 strains exhibited extremely low egg hatchability and produced mostly female progeny, whereas offspring from the crosses between the D2 and ND strains showed more than 50% hatchability for B-1 eggs and a female-biased sex ratio. Thus, the absence of segregation observed in the crosses between the D1 and ND strains appears to be due to the severe hybrid breakdown that occurred in the B-1 generation.																	0931-2048					JUN	2006	130	5					329	335		10.1111/j.1439-0418.2006.01050.x								WOS:000237693600012

JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY												Organisms can diverge in life history when introduced outside their native range due to release from predators, competitors, and parasites, and also due to genetic drift and local adaptation. We studied the ecology of the American Bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) in its introduced range in British Columbia (BC). To assess differences between introduced and native populations, we compared the population ecology of BC bullfrogs to published life-history parameters from the bullfrog's extensive native range in eastern North America. In BC, bullfrogs emerged from hibernation in late April and early May. Breeding choruses developed fully when air temperatures exceeded 20 degrees C. Eggs were laid from mid-June to mid-July when the mean water temperature was 20 degrees C. Mean egg mass size was 13,014 +/- 7,296 eggs (mean standard deviation). Tadpoles hatched in 3 to 5 days and overwintered the first year as tadpoles. Approximately 68% of the tadpoles metamorphosed at the end of the following summer, but the remaining spent a second winter in the pond. Bullfrogs were large enough to attain sexual maturity 2 yr after metamorphosis. Bullfrog population density among ponds varied from 4.1 to 530 frogs/ha. Terrestrial insects were the primary prey item of bullfrogs < 150 g, whereas frogs were the primary prey item of larger bullfrogs. The life-history parameter values estimated for BC bullfrogs were within the range observed for bullfrogs in their native habitats. Due to milder weather conditions in southwestern BC, the seasonal pattern and growth rate of bullfrogs were similar to lower latitude populations in Kentucky and Missouri. We found no evidence to support the hypothesis that when released from native predators and parasites bullfrogs build up to unusually high population densities or attain significantly larger sizes in their introduced range.																	0022-1511					JUN	2006	40	2					249	260		10.1670/68-05A.1								WOS:000238621400014						
J	Jamieson, SE; Gilchrist, HG; Merkel, FR; Diamond, AW; Falk, K				Jamieson, SE; Gilchrist, HG; Merkel, FR; Diamond, AW; Falk, K			Endogenous reserve dynamics of northern common eiders wintering in Greenland	POLAR BIOLOGY												Endogenous reserves influence both survival and reproduction of many waterfowl species, but little is known about reserve levels of most species during the nonbreeding season, particularly those wintering at high latitudes. We investigated whether age, sex, and season were related to carcass composition of northern common eiders (Somateria mollissima borealis) wintering in southwest Greenland during 1999-2002. Adults carried more lipid and protein than juveniles during all winters. Among both age classes, males and females had similar fat levels but males carried slightly more protein. There was no dramatic seasonal variation in lipid or protein content. This suggests that during the period of this study, these eiders did not experience large-scale nutritional shortfalls. As predicted, Greenlandic eiders carried more lipid reserves than eider populations wintering in more temperate environments. Contrary to prediction, there was little relation between reserve levels and photoperiod, ambient temperature, or hunting disturbance intensity. Our results suggest that both sexes are equally capable of dealing with nutritional deficits, and that juvenile birds are more prone to nutritional stress as evidenced by their consistently poorer body condition.

We show here that the CO/FT regulatory module, which controls flowering time in response to variations in daylength in annual plants, controls flowering in aspen trees. Unexpectedly, however, it also controls the short-day-induced growth cessation and bud set occurring in the fall. This regulatory mechanism can explain the ecogenetic variation in a highly adaptive trait: the critical daylength for growth cessation displayed by aspen trees sampled across a latitudinal gradient spanning northern Europe.

ATP concentration and AEC levels have been extensively studied in a diverse group of soils. However, little knowledge is available on the levels of ATP and AEC in soils, of mangroves. We report here the levels of adenylates ATP, adenosine di-phosphate (ADP) and adenosine monophosphate (AMP)) and AEC in soils of undisturbed mangroves of South-, Middle-, North- and Little-Andamans. Relevant soil physico-chemical and microbial parameters and their relationship to ATP and AEC were also examined. Averaged across various mangrove sites, total N level was 1.44 +/- 0.13 g kg l, organic C 15.6 +/- 1.5 g kg(-1), microbial biomass C 410 +/- 35 mu g kg(-1), microbial biomass N 34 +/- 2 mu g kg(-1) and qCO(2) 41.1 +/- 4.4 mg CO2 (g biomass, C)(-1) d(-1). Among the adenylates, ATP ranged from 2.32 to 3.22 nmol g(-1) (mean 2.87 +/- 0.29), AMP from 0.21 to 0.29 nmol g(-1) (mean 0.25 +/- 0.03) and ADP from 0.41 to 0.48 nmol g(-1) mean 0.44 +/- 0.03). Across sites, the average microbial biomass C/organic C ratio was 2.6 +/- 0.2% and microbial biomass C/N ratio at the Mangrove sites was wider and ranged from 11.2 to 14.5 with a mean of 12.0 +/- 0.9. The ATP/microbial biomass C ratio ranged from 6.0 to 8.2 mu mol g(-1) with a mean of 7.0 +/- 0.6 mu mol g(-1), markedly lower than the worldwide average of 10-12 mu mol g(-1) reported in a wide range of soils. Lower ATP/microbial biomass C ratio in our mangrove soils is most likely due to a changed microbial community structure indicating a decomposition pathway dominated by fungi and microorganisms with large microbial biomass C/N ratio. The AEC levels were consistently > 8.0 (mean 0.87) at all the sites, suggesting that the majority of microorganisms in these mangrove soils are probably dormant.																	0011-3891					MAY 10	2006	90	9					1258	1263										WOS:000237837500025						
J	Toyama, M; Ihara, F; Yaginuma, K				Toyama, Masatoshi; Ihara, Fumio; Yaginuma, Katsuhiko			Formation of aggregations in adults of the brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys (St(a)over-circle-l) (Heteroptera : Pentatomidae): The role of antennae in short-range locations	APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY												We examined whether stimuli among one another are involved in the short-range locations of the Halyomorpha halys adult, which often forms aggregations when overwintering. Ten diapausing adults were released into a clear container at 10 degrees C. After a certain time period, their distribution was compared with a random distribution, and a tendency for a strong concentrated distribution with crowding was observed under both light and dark conditions. However, antennectomy prevented bugs from aggregating and this clarified the role of antenna in short-range locations. This finding suggests that overwintering aggregation in H. halys is guided by a chemical or tactile interaction among individuals, at least within a narrow range. In addition, the relationship between this aggregation habit and temperature was examined. Although temperatures of 15 degrees C and 20 degrees C caused bugs to become active, the habit of settling close to one another was not reduced. Based on these results, we inferred that the aggregation habit of H. halys adults itself is not temperature dependent, and that the overwintering aggregation is caused by an increase in opportunity for contact with each other, such as from a mutual preference for the overwintering environment, and a decrease in behavioral activity resulting from a decrease in temperature.																	0003-6862					MAY	2006	41	2					309	315		10.1303/aez.2006.309								WOS:000238903300015

Conidium production was affected by nutrition, pH, temperature and light conditions. Of the agar media tested, Czapek Dox agar (CZA) and half-strength oatmeal agar (OMA) were the only media where sporulation occurred at all temperatures tested under a 12-h light: 12-h dark photoperiod (L/D). The optimum temperature for conidium production was 20 degrees C on (2)\(1) OMA, whereas there was no optimum temperature on CZA. Under a 12-h near-ultraviolet (NUV): 12-h dark photoperiod (NUV/D), similar numbers of conidia were produced on CZA at 6.66, 14.56, and 22.78 W m(-2), whereas on OMA conidium production was the highest at 14.56 W m(-2). When NUV/D and L/D conditions were compared, similar numbers of conidia where produced on CZA, whereas OMA conidium production was superior under the NUV/D photoperiod. Considerable variation in sporulation and degree of virulence of D. avenacea was detected among isolates from different geographic areas. The most virulent conidia were obtained on OMA at 20 degrees C incubated under continuous illumination NUV light. Therefore, the most suitable conditions for conidium production of D. avenacea were growth for 1 week on OMA at 20 degrees C under continuous NUV at an intensity of 14.56 W m(-2). Under these conditions, 1.1 x 10(5) conidia mL(-1) were produced which is the highest sporulation yet reported for any Drechslera spp., which are traditionally poor sporulators.

J	Thompson, R; Clark, RM				Thompson, R; Clark, RM			Spatio-temporal modelling and assessment of within-species phenological variability using thermal time methods	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY												Phenological observations of flowering date, budding date or senescence provide very valuable time series. They hold out the prospect for relating plant growth to environmental and climatic factors and hence for engendering a better understanding of plant physiology under natural conditions. The statistical establishment of associations between time series of phenological data and climatic factors provides a means of aiding forecasts of the biological impacts of future climatic change. However, it must be kept in mind that plant growth and behaviour vary spatially as well as temporally. Environmental, climatic and genetic diversity can give rise to spatially structured variation on a range of scales. The variations extend from large-scale geographical (clinal) trends, through medium-scale population and sub-population fluctuations, to micro-scale differentiation among neighbouring plants, where spatially close individuals are found to be genetically more alike than those some distance apart. We developed spatio-temporal phenological models that allow observations from multiple locations to be analysed simultaneously. We applied the models to the first-flowering dates of Prunus padus and Tilia cordata from localities as far apart as Norway and the Caucasus. Our growing-degree-day approach yielded a good fit to the available phenological data and yet involved only a small number of model parameters. It indicated that plants should display different sensitivities to temperature change according to their geographical location and the time of year at which they flower. For spring-flowering plants, we found strong temperature sensitivities for islands and archipelagos with oceanic climates, and low sensitivities in the interiors of continents.																	0020-7128					MAY	2006	50	5					312	322		10.1007/s00484-005-0017-4								WOS:000237291800008	16506032

Integrated bioengineering and geotechnical treatments for streambank restoration and stabilization along a landfill	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Vegetative-based bioengineering treatments were integrated with geotechnical treatments to provide effective, affordable and en vironmentally sound restoration and stabilization of an eroding streambank [8 m (27 ft) high and 145 m (470 ft) long] along a sanitary landfill adjacent to Mill Creek in Cincinnati, Ohio. Bank stabilization design featured the use of dormant live brush in several configurations: live poles installed through interstices in a rock toe; brush layers laid between geogrid-wrapped soil lifts; live stakes through a coir blanket, and a brush fascine staked in a trench near the top of bank. Vegetation has grown vigorously and no erosion problems have been observed. Bank stability was confirmed by a topographic survey in 2004 showing no observable difference from a post-construction survey in 1999. A quantitative vegetation survey in April 2004 determined essentially 100 percent grass coverage on the banks. Seventy-four percent of stakes/poles installed in the upper bank survived, white 39 percent in the lower bank survived. Overall, percent coverage by the shrub/tree layer was visually estimated at about 75 percent.																	0022-4561					MAY-JUN	2006	61	3					144	153										WOS:000239080600010						
J	Kamimoto, S; Nohara, R; Ichikawa, T				Kamimoto, Satoshi; Nohara, Rika; Ichikawa, Toshio			Coordination between the electrical activity of developing indirect flight muscles and the firing activity of a population of neurosecretory cells in the silkmoth, Bombyx mori	ZOOLOGICAL SCIENCE												The developing indirect flight muscles of pharate moths are characterized by a rhythmic discharge of a long bout of flight-pattern-like muscle potentials in the absence of contractions. The electrical activity of the dorsal longitudinal flight muscles (DLMs) in the silkmoth, Bombyx mori, was discernible as a cluster of many series of muscle potentials that last for several minutes on day 4 of the pupal period. The duration of the active phases and the period of rhythmic activity gradually increased to a peak value on day 7 or 8 and then declined until the end of the pupal period. Mean duration of the active phases ( SD) and the mean period of the rhythmic activity ( SD) at the peak were 38.7 +/- 8.7 min and 74.5 +/- 7.3 min, respectively. The rhythmic electrical activity of immature DLMs was closely coordinated with the rhythmic (bursting) activity of a population of neurosecretory cells that are known to produce pheromone-biosynthesis activating neuropeptide (PBAN) and its related peptides, which belong to the multifunctional peptide family, pyrokinin/PBAN. The DLMs always became active a few minutes after the neurosecretory cells, and the timing of onset of these two activities appeared to be strictly regulated by a neural mechanism. The implication of the coordinated activity for development and maturation of imaginal tissues, including the flight motor system, and possible functions of the neuropeptides in this development are discussed.																	0289-0003					MAY	2006	23	5					449	457		10.2108/zsj.23.449								WOS:000240086800006	16766864					
J	Matalin, AV				Matalin, AV			Geographic variability of the life cycle in Pterostichus melanarius (Coleoptera, Carabidae)	ZOOLOGICHESKY ZHURNAL												The seasonal dynamics of the Pterostichus melanarius (Ill.) activity has two peaks: in mid-June - early July and in late July - mid-August. In southwestern Moldova, such peaks were registered two decades later than in Moscow region. In both regions, larvae and imagoes hibernate. The hibernated immature and individuals that bread formerly start breeding at the same time. The mean number of eggs per female was 1.5 times higher in the hibernated immature individuals than in the postgenerative ones. In the steppe zone, the total number of eggs in breeding immature and spent females was equal, while in the southern taiga, it was higher in hibernated immature beetles. In Moldova, the mean number of eggs in immature females of the new generation was hardly lower that in hibernated immature ones, but the total number of eggs was much higher. In the southern taiga, both these characteristics did not differ in hibernated and nonhibernated immature females. In Moldova, most beetles of the new generation were reproduced during the current season, whereas in Moscow region, about half of them were hibernated without breeding. In the most part of the natural habitat, the life cycle of P. melanarius is realized as polyvariant one. The population consists of both individuals that develop during one year (hibernated larvae) and those that develop during two years (hibernated immature and spent imagoes). Two subpopulations that hibernate at different stages of ontogenesis are distinguished at the northern boundary of their range. The development of individuals in each of the subpopulations proceeds during two years. So. under these conditions, the polyvariant life cycle is substituted for the monovariant one. Such a life cycle is proposed to name a compensatory monovariant, and the populations composed of individuals with this life cycle are named bysidian.																	0044-5134					MAY	2006	85	5					573	585										WOS:000238527100002						
J	Fielding, D				Fielding, Dennis			Optimal diapause strategies of a grasshopper, Melanoplus sanguinipes	JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE												Previous analyses of diapause in insects have most often focused on the timing of the switch from non-diapausing to diapausing offspring in bivoltine populations and have assumed that diapause is irreversible or that the insect cannot survive winter if not in diapause. Many insects exhibit more flexibility in their life cycles, such as the age at which diapause begins, and facultative diapause, that may influence the evolution of different diapause strategies in different environments. The grasshopper Melanoplus sanguinipes F. (Orthoptera: Acrididae), has a very wide geographic range over which diapause characteristics vary greatly. Embryonic diapause in this species may be under maternal control, may be obligate or facultative (i.e., may be averted by cold temperature treatment of pre-diapause embryos), and embryos may enter diapause at different ages. Diapause traits were examined in two populations of M. sanguinipes from very different environments. In the population from a temperate climate (Idaho, USA), diapause was facultative, i.e., pre-diapause embryos averted diapause when held at 5 degrees C for 90 days at all ages tested (7 days and older). The Idaho embryos entered diapause in late stage of development if held at 22 degrees C for 30 days or more. In populations from subarctic Alaska, USA, embryos also entered diapause in a late stage of development, but diapause was obligate and could not be averted by chilling in the pre-diapause stages. Simulated evolution of these traits over a wide range of season-lengths showed that late stage diapause is an essential trait in very short season environments, resulting in early hatching, and a semivoltine life-cycle. Facultative diapause enabled bivoltinism to be a viable strategy in shorter seasons than when diapause was obligate. At transitions from semivoltine to univoltine, and from univoltine to bivoltine life cycles, populations with obligate diapause adopted a strategy of no diapause (via maternal effects) to enable univoltine life cycles.																	1536-2442	2250-2645				APR 7	2006	6								02									WOS:000239694200001

The seeds are structurally adapted for wind dispersal but little is known about their fate after dispersal. Some studies of seed viability in situ indicate survival for up to two years in temperate orchid species. Seeds stored in the laboratory may last much longer. We investigated seed viability of seven North American orchid species with seed packets buried in a range of soil and wood substrates within their natural habitats. In Goodyera pubescens most seeds germinated within one year. Four other species continued to germinate sparsely during the observation period, but after almost seven years many seeds were still viable. In one species, Liparis liliifolia, seeds that had been in situ for four years had germination rates as high as 68% when sown in vitro with a compatible fungus. The remaining two species did not germinate during the observation period but the seeds were judged to be intact and tested positively for viability after four years in the ground. These observations are interpreted as different species-specific strategies for in situ germination and their seed bank potential is discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Pfenning, B; Poethke, HJ				Pfenning, B; Poethke, HJ			Variability in the life history of the water strider Gerris lacustris (Heteroptera : Gerridae) across small spatial scales	ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												1. Variability in life-history traits of the common pond skater Gerris lacustris (L.) (Heteroptera: Gerridae) was investigated on a small geographical scale in Bavaria, Germany (approximate to 49 degrees N). In an area of approximately 3.5 x 3.0 km, voltinism and wing length data of G. lacustris were recorded from 65 ponds located either in an open field or surrounded by forest. 2. Life history differed significantly between populations in the two habitat types. Gerris lacustris showed a bivoltine life-cycle in most of the field ponds with a high proportion of long-winged individuals in the diapause generation and a large increase of the short-winged morph in the midsummer generation. In contrast, almost all populations inhabiting forest ponds were univoltine. Only a few forest populations produced any second generation larvae. The long-winged morph dominated during the whole season in forest ponds. 3. The appearance of first-instar larvae was delayed by 3-4 weeks in forest ponds compared with field ponds. Presumably, low temperatures led to this reduction in the developmental rate of eggs and larvae. Consequently, 'field larvae' of the first generation developed under increasing daylight conditions (triggering direct reproduction and brachyptery) but 'forest larvae' developed under a shortening photoperiod (triggering diapause and macroptery). 4. Offspring raised from 'forest parents' in the laboratory showed the same variability in life history when reared in a cool (16.9 +/- 2.4 degrees C) or warm (23.1 +/- 1.8 degrees C) temperature regime. 5. Given the small spatial scale of the study, it is concluded that the variability in the life history of G. lacustris has a strong phenotypic component.																	0307-6946					APR	2006	31	2					123	130		10.1111/j.0307-6946.2006.00763.x								WOS:000236799800004

The data obtained were used for the estimation of the thermal requirements of this predator by a linear and nonlinear model (Lactin 2-model). Developmental thresholds that were estimated by the linear model for immature stages of egg, protonymph, and deutonymph were approximately the same and found to be 11.71, 10.11, and 11.28 degrees C, respectively, whereas that of the larval stage was found to be lower (7 degrees C). The Lactin-2 model was also applied, and lower values were estimated for all immature stages than those by the linear model. Biological characteristics and life table parameters of the predator were also studied at 15, 20, 25, 30, and 32.5 degrees C. Preoviposition period was shortest at high temperatures of 30 and 32.5 degrees C (1.18 and 1.08 d, respectively), whereas fecundity was highest at 30 degrees C. Longevity of adults and mean generation time was longest at 15 degrees C. The intrinsic rate of increase was highest at 25 and 30 degrees C (0.22 and 0.23 d(-1), respectively), whereas doubling time was found to be shortest at 30 degrees C. The results show that this predator develops effectively at a broad range of temperatures. Moreover, it can increase at relatively high temperatures and is well adapted to the high temperatures that occur in Mediterranean region.																	0046-225X					APR	2006	35	2					212	218		10.1603/0046-225X-35.2.212								WOS:000236865500004						
J	Mathias, D; Reed, LK; Bradshaw, WE; Holzapfel, CM				Mathias, D; Reed, LK; Bradshaw, WE; Holzapfel, CM			Evolutionary divergence of circadian and photoperiodic phenotypes in the pitcher-plant mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL RHYTHMS												For decades, chronobiologists have investigated the relationship between the circadian clock that mediates daily activities and the photoperiodic timer that mediates seasonal activities. The main experiment used to infer a circadian basis for photoperiodic time measurement is the Nanda-Hanmer protocol (NH). Herein, the authors compare additive and nonadditive (dominance and epistasis) genetic effects that lead to the divergence of populations of the pitcher-plant mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii, for critical photoperiod (CPP) and amplitude of the rhythmic response to NH for 3 temporal-geographic scales: 1) Over geological time between populations in northern and southern clades, 2) over millennial time between populations within the northern clade, and 3) over generational time between lines selected for long and short CPP from within a single population. The authors show that the pattern of additive, dominance, and epistatic effects depends on the time scale over which populations or lines have diverged. Patterns for genetic differences between populations for CPP and response to NH reveal similarities over geological and millennial time scales but differences over shorter periods of evolution. These results, and the observation that neither the period nor amplitude of the NH rhythm are significantly correlated with CPP among populations, lead the authors to conclude that the rhythmic response to NH has evolved independently of photoperiodic response in populations of W. smithii. The implication is that in this species, genetic modification of the circadian clock has not been the basis for the adaptive modification of photoperiodic time measurement over the climatic gradient of North America.

Initiation and termination of the body mass and testicular cycles are separately regulated photoperiodic events. For example, under stimulatory photoperiods the response curve of body mass does not overlap with that of the testicular growth. A response-specific photoperiodism is adaptive, since gain in body mass, critical to spring migration, precedes gonadal recrudescence. Finally, migration as indicated by the night-time migratory restlessness under experimental situations (e.g., intense locomotion under caged condition-called Zugunruhe) appears to be regulated by a separate circadian oscillator.																	0021-8375					APR	2006	147	2					281	286		10.1007/s10336-006-0055-7								WOS:000236646700017

An historical, 46-year phenological record, and meteorological data set for period 1955-2000 were used to analyse the abilities of the statistical models to predict flowering and leaf unfolding time for a set of wild and cultivated plants in Slovenia. With single phenological model, we have predicted timing of phenophase for particular plant on the base of previous phenological data of the same plant or on the base of previous phenological data of the other plants. The most frequently included independent variables in such models were common silver birch, dandelion and horse-chestnut. It was stated that these plants may be used as phenological indicators in given conditions. Correlation analysis and linear multiple regression were applied to establish the relationship among phenological development and climatic variables (temperature, rainfall, North Atlantic Oscillation, day length). Different thresholds temperatures have been selected for eight different locations with the smallest standard deviation in growing degree day's method to calculate thermal time. Various plant species responded differently to the same climatic factors and were best fitted to certain geographic region. The timings of spring phenophases strongly correlated with temperature of the precedent months, on the other hand rainfall and North Atlantic Oscillation explained smaller part of phenological variability. Photothermal time significantly improved results of phenoclimatic models when taken into account instead of thermal time. The validity of the results was tested with cross validation method and using independent data set for the year 2000, respectively Considering the high year-to-year variability of phenological events, the models presented provide satisfactory estimations of the leaf unfolding and flowering dates. Formal equations presented in this study could be powerfully extended and applied to other sites and plants, provided that a sufficiently long time series of phenological and meteorological data were available.

We made two collecting trips through the three Baltic countries in the summer of 2000. The first trip was made in early Summer to get spring species and the second in late August to get the fungivorous species. We used baiting methods for collecting Drosophila, while the earlier results were obtained e.g. using net sweeping. In general, the drosophilid fauna of Estonia resembles the well-known fauna of the Nordic countries. The single most interesting result was that Chymomyza amoena, a recent American invader of central Europe, was found. Another interesting finding was the relative rarity of D. subobscura and the Virtual absence of D. virilis group species.																	0785-8760					MAR 3	2006	17	1					13	20										WOS:000235962900003

Probability plots, transition matrices, and change-point models and more advanced techniques such as generalized auto-regression models and hidden Markov chains are presented and applied on a study on the activity of Rhipicephalus appendiculatus, the major vector of Theileria parva, a fatal disease in cattle. This study presents individual measurements on female R. appendiculatus, which are terminating their diapause (resting status) and become active. Comprehending activity patterns is very important to better understand the ecology of R. appendiculatus. The model indicates that activity and non-activity act in an absorbing way meaning that once a tick becomes active it shows a tendency to remain active. The change-point model estimates that the sudden change in activity happens on December 10. The reaction of ticks on acceleration and changes in rainfall and temperature indicates that ticks can sense climatic changes. The study revealed the underlying not visually observable states during diapause development of the adult tick of R. appendiculatus. These states could be related to phases during the dynamic event of diapause development and post-diapause activity in R. appendiculatus.																	1352-8505					MAR	2006	13	1					69	87		10.1007/s10651-005-5691-1								WOS:000235461900005

Water fleas of the genus Daphnia are considered rare in tropical regions, and information on species distribution and community ecology is scarce and anecdotal. This study presents the results of a survey of Daphnia species distribution and community composition in 40 standing waterbodies in southern Kenya. The study sites cover a wide range of tropical standing aquatic habitats, from small ephemeral pools to large permanent lakes between approximately 700 and 2800 m a.s.l. Our analysis combines data on Daphnia distribution and abundance from zooplankton samples and dormant eggs in surface sediments. 2. Nearly 70% (27 of 40) of the sampled waterbodies were inhabited by Daphnia. Although their abundance in the active community was often very low, this high incidence shows that Daphnia can be equally widespread in tropical regions as in temperate regions. 3. Analysis of local species assemblages from dormant eggs in surface sediments was more productive than snapshot sampling of zooplankton communities. Surface-sediment samples yielded eight Daphnia species in total, and allowed the detection of Daphnia in 25 waterbodies; zooplankton samples revealed the presence of only four Daphnia species in 16 waterbodies. 4. Daphnia barbata, D. laevis, and D. pulex were the most frequently recorded and most abundant Daphnia species. Canonical correspondence analysis of species-environment relationships indicates that variation in the Daphnia community composition of Kenyan waters was best explained by fish presence, temperature, macrophyte cover and altitude. Daphnia barbata and D. pulex tended to co-occur with each other and with fish. Both species tended to occur in relatively large (> 10 ha) and deeper (> 2 m) alkaline waters (pH 8.5). Daphnia laevis mainly occurred in cool and clear, macrophyte-dominated lakes at high altitudes.

J	Harvey, DS; Weatherhead, PJ				Harvey, DS; Weatherhead, PJ			Hibernation site selection by eastern Massasauga Rattlesnakes (Sistrurus catenatus catenatus) near their northern range limit	JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY												Hibernation sites at higher latitudes must protect snakes from colder conditions for longer periods of time. Because fewer locations are likely to be suitable, hibernation site availability may restrict the northern distribution of snakes. We considered overwinter mortality, hibernation site fidelity, and the abundance of suitable hibernation sites based on surface features to assess whether Massasauga Rattlesnakes are likely to be limited by hibernation site availability on the Bruce Peninsula, Ontario, Canada. We used three years of radio telemetry to locate 46 hibernation sites of 32 individual snakes. Snakes hibernated individually in old root systems, rodent burrows, and rock crevices in forested areas. Hibernation sites could be differentiated frown forested areas generally available to snakes but not from locations with holes and crevices in the immediate vicinity of hibernation sites. Few snakes hibernated in the same location in consecutive years, although most (> 70%) hibernated within 100 m of their previous location. Overwinter mortality over three years (23%) was similar to mortality during the active season (21%). Our results suggest that Massasauga Rattlesnakes may be limited by the availability of suitable hibernation sites, but sites of similar quality to those used by overwintering snakes are locally abundant. The location of hibernation sites within forests could not be predicted reliably based on surface features. Therefore, efforts to conserve habitat for this threatened species should consider all forested areas on the Bruce Peninsula as potential hibernation habitat.																	0022-1511					MAR	2006	40	1					66	73		10.1670/89-05A.1								WOS:000236714500008

Control of the oriental fruit moth, Grapholita molesta, using entomopathogenic nematodes in laboratory and fruit bin assays	JOURNAL OF NEMATOLOGY												The oriental fruit moth (OFM), Grapholita molesta (Busck), which is among the most important insect pests of peaches and nectarines, has developed resistance to a wide range of insecticides. We investigated the ability of the entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN) Steinernema carpocapsae (Weiser), S. feltiae (Filipjev), S. riobrave (Cabanillas et al.), and Heterorhabditis marelatus (Liu and Berry) to control OFM under laboratory and fruit bin conditions. At a dosage of 10 infective juveniles (IJ)/cm(2) in the laboratory, S. carpocapsae caused 63%, S. feltiae 87.8%, S. riobrave 75.6%, and H. marelatus 67.1% OFM mortality. All four nematode species caused significant OFM larval mortality in comparison to the non treated controls. Steinernema feltiae was used for the bin assays due to the higher OFM mortality it caused than the other tested EPN species and to its ability to find OFM under cryptic environments. Diapausing cocooned OFM larvae in miniature fruit bins were susceptible to IJ of S. feltiae in infested corner supports and cardboard strips. Treatment of bins with suspensions of 10 or 25 S. feltiae IJ/ml water with wetting agent (Silwet L77) resulted in 33.3 to 59% and 77.7 to 81.6% OFM mortality in corner supports and cardboard strips, respectively. This paper presents new information on the use of EPN, specifically S. feltiae, as nonchemical means of OFM control.																	0022-300X					MAR	2006	38	1					168	171										WOS:000240273200021

They are also used extensively in forensic entomology, predominantly to establish a minimum time since death, or a minimum post-mortem interval, using the larval length as a 'biological clock'. This study examined the larval growth rate of a forensically important fly species, Calliphora vicina Robineau-Desvoidy (Diptera: Calliphoridae) at temperatures of between 4 degrees C and 30 degrees C, under controlled laboratory conditions. The laboratory flies had been trapped initially in London, U.K. The minimum developmental temperature was estimated to be 1 degrees C and 4700 accumulated degree hours (ADH) were required for development from egg hatch to the point of pupariation. Lines fitted to the laboratory larval growth data were found to adequately explain the growth of larvae in the field. The nature of variation in growth rates from geographically isolated populations is discussed.

Peak numbers of I st-stage larvae of both parasites were shed by Dall's sheep on their winter range from March until May. In larval development experiments in the Mackenzie Mountains, peak numbers of infective 3rd-stage larvae of P. odocoilei were available in gastropod intermediate hosts in August-September. For both protostrongylids, the majority of transmission likely Occurs on the winter range, with infection of gastropods when they emerge from hibernation in spring, and infection Of Dall'S Sheep upon their return in fall. We validated a degree-day model for temperature-dependent development of larval P. odocoilei in gastropods, and applied degree-day models to describe and predict spatial and temporal patterns in development of P. odocoilei and P. stilesi in northern North America. Temperature-dependent larval development may currently limit northward range expansion of P. odocoilei into naive populations of Dall's sheep in the Arctic, but climate warming may soon eliminate Such constraints. In Subarctic regions where both P. odocoilei and P. stilesi are endemic, the length of the parasite 'growing season' (when temperatures were above the threshold for larval development) and amount of warming available for parasite development has increased over the last 50 years. Further climate warming and extension of the seasonal window for transmission may lead to amplification of parasite populations and disease Outbreaks in host populations.

J	Koehn, JD; Harrington, DJ				Koehn, JD; Harrington, DJ			Environmental conditions and timing for the spawning of Murray cod (Maccullochella peelii peelii) and the endangered trout cod (Maccullochella macquariensis) in southeastern Australian rivers	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												The environmental conditions and timing of spawning of Murray cod and trout cod were investigated over three successive years in the regulated Murray River and in the nearby, unregulated Ovens River. Larvae were collected in drift samples from early November. Murray cod larvae were present for up to ten weeks, but trout cod larvae were present for only about two weeks. Cod larvae were collected in both rivers in each year sampled, despite a range of flow conditions. Spawning periods, estimated by back-calculating larval ages and egg incubation times, were in part, concurrent for the two species, beginning in October when water temperatures had exceeded 15 degrees C, allowing the occasional hybridization that has been noted between these two species. Trout cod larvae (10.0-18.2 mm) were significantly larger than Murray cod larvae (9.5-14.8 mm) in both years and the larvae of both species were significantly larger in 1995/6 than in 1994/5 in the Murray River. There was no relationship between larval size and water temperature, but later spawning times at the upper Murray River site coincided with lower water temperatures. Larval abundance varied significantly between sites, samples and years, with peak larval abundances occurring in November. Murray cod larval abundance was best explained by the explanatory variables of year, day length and change in flow over the previous 7 d. Environmental conditions for the spawning of Murray cod and trout cod are similar, and both species exhibit a similar larval dispersal strategy by emergence into the drift. Spawning occurred regularly under a range of flow conditions and it is likely that recruitment of these species in these rivers is driven by the subsequent survival of larvae and juveniles.

J	Griffith, TM; Watson, MA				Griffith, TM; Watson, MA			Is evolution necessary for range expansion? Manipulating reproductive timing of a weedy annual transplanted beyond its range	AMERICAN NATURALIST												Ecologists often consider how environmental factors limit a species' geographic range. However, recent models suggest that geographic distribution also may be determined by a species' ability to adapt to novel environmental conditions. In this study, we empirically tested whether further evolution would be necessary for northern expansion of the weedy annual cocklebur (Xanthium strumarium) in its native North American range. We transplanted seedlings beyond the northern border and photoperiodically manipulated reproductive timing, a trait important for adaptation to shorter growing seasons at higher latitudes within the range, to determine whether further evolution of this trait would result in a phenotype viable beyond the range. Earlier reproductive induction enabled plants to produce mature seeds beyond the range and to achieve a reproductive output similar to those grown within the range. Therefore, evolution of earlier reproduction in marginal populations would be necessary for northward range expansion. This study is the first to empirically show that evolution in an ecologically important trait would enable a species to survive and reproduce beyond its current range. These results suggest that relatively few traits may limit a species' range and that identifying evolutionary constraints on such traits could be important for predicting geographic distribution.																	0003-0147					FEB	2006	167	2					153	164		10.1086/498945								WOS:000235214200002	16670977

Adults started reproduction soon after adult emergence under long-day conditions, while they entered diapause under short-day conditions. The critical photoperiod for the induction of diapause was between 13 and 14 h and between 15 and 16 h in insects of the Osaka and Hokkaido populations, respectively. Under long-day conditions, most insects of the Osaka population emerged as reproductive adults at any temperature used, whereas those in the Hokkaido population tended to show lower incidence of diapause as the temperature increased. Preoviposition periods in females of the Osaka population were shorter than those of the Hokkaido population. The duration of diapause in the Osaka population was shorter at 30 degrees C than at 25 degrees C under short-day conditions. In Osaka, D. baccarum is assumed to produce three generations a year, like several other seed-sucking bugs. In Hokkaido, a greater proportion of adults produces the second generation in summer under long daylengths.

Mass-specific metabolic rates of 173 animal species under various conditions of prolonged food deprivation (aestivation, hibernation, sit-and-wait existence) and/or living at temperatures near the freezing point of water were analysed. 2. These minimum life-supporting metabolic rates are independent of body mass over a nearly 80-million-fold body mass range and independent of temperature over a range of -1.7 to 30 degrees C, with a mean value of 0.1 W kg(-1) and 95% CI from 0.02 to 0.67 W kg(-1). 3. Additionally, 66 measurements of anoxic metabolic rates in 32 species capable of surviving at least 1 h of anoxia were analysed. While similarly mass-independent, anoxic metabolic rates are significantly more widely scattered (1200-fold 95% CI); they are on average one order of magnitude lower than during normoxia and depend on temperature with Q(10) = 2.8. 4. Energy losses at the time of 50% mortality during anoxia are 30-300 times smaller than the energy losses tolerated by normoxic organisms in the various energy-saving regimes studied. 5. These principal differences form the basis for proposing two alternative strategies by which organisms survive environmental stress: the regime of abandoned metabolic control ('slow death'), when, as in anoxic obligate aerobes, measured rates of energy dissipation can predominantly reflect chaotic processes of tissue degradation rather than meaningful biochemical reactions; and the regime of minimum metabolic control, when biochemical order is sustained at the expense of ordered metabolic reactions. Death or survival in the regime of abandoned metabolic control is dictated by the amount of accumulated biochemical damage and not by the available energy resources, as it is in the regime of minimum metabolic control.

J	Deu, M; Rattunde, F; Chantereau, J				Deu, M; Rattunde, F; Chantereau, J			A global view of genetic diversity in cultivated sorghums using a core collection	GENOME												We report here an analysis of the structure of genetic diversity in cultivated sorghums. A core collection of 210 landraces representative of race, latitude of origin, response to day length, and production system was analysed with 74 RFLP probes dispersed throughout the genome. Multivariate analyses showed the specificity of the subrace guinea margaritiferum, as well as the geographical and racial pattern of genetic diversity. Neighbour-joining analysis revealed a clear differentiation between northern and southern equatorial African accessions. The presence of Asian accessions in these 2 major geographical poles for sorghum evolution indicated two introductions of sorghum into Asia. Morphological race also influenced the pattern of sorghum genetic diversity. A single predominant race was identified in 8 of 10 clusters of accessions, i.e., 1 kafir, 1 durra, 4 guinea, and 2 caudatum clusters. Guinea sorghums, with the exception of accessions in the margaritiferum subrace, clustered in 3 geographical groups, i.e., western African, southern African, and Asian guinea clusters; the latter two appeared more closely related. Caudatum were mainly distributed in 2 clusters, the African Great Lakes caudatum cluster and those African caudatum originating from other African regions. This last differentiation appears related to contrasting photoperiod responses. These results aid in the optimization of sampling accessions for introgression in breeding programs.																	0831-2796					FEB	2006	49	2					168	180		10.1139/G05-092								WOS:000236286100009	16498467

The species has ample genetic variation in photoperiodism (adult diapause) and circadian rhythmicity (pupal eclosion rhythm), with adaptive latitudinal clines in both of them. The possible common genetic basis between the variability of photoperiodism and circadian rhythms was studied by a long-term crossing experiment. A northerri strain (65 degrees N) having long critical day length (CDL = 19.9 h) for diapause, early phase of the entrained rhythm in LD 3:21 (Psi(LD 3:21) = 12.3 h), and short period (tau = 18.8 h) of the free-running rhythm for the eclosion rhythm was crossed with a southern strain (42 degrees N) having short CDL (12.4 h), late eclosion phase (Psi(LD) 3:21 = 20.2 h), and long period (tau = 22.8 h). After 54 generations, including free recombination, artificial selection, and genetic drift, a novel strain resulted, having even more "southern" diapause and more "northern" eclosion rhythm characteristics than found in any of the geographical strairts. The observed complete separation of eclosion rhythm characteristics from photoperiodism is a new finding in D. littoralis; in earlier studies followed for 16 generations, the changes had been mostly parallel. Evidently, the genes controlling the variability of the eclosion rhythm and photoperiodism in D. littoralis are different but closely linked. To test for the possible gene loci underlying the observed geographical variability, the period gene was studied in 10 strains covering all the known clock variability in D. littoralis. The authors sequenced the most suspected Thr-Gly region, which is known to take part in the adaptive clock variability in Drosophila melanogaster. No coding differences were found in the strains, showing that this region is not included in the adaptive clock variability in D. littoralis.

Adult females chose Pinus densiflora bolts as oviposition substrate when supplied with cedar and pine bolts simultaneously, whereas some females from one locality oviposited on cedar bolts when supplied with them exclusively. Seventy-three percent of 40 eggs hatched in cedar bolts. When the first instar larvae were inoculated on cedar bolts, the development was stunted greatly and all died during the larval stage. Two of 20 larvae that were inoculated on cedar bolts at the third instar entered the diapause and one larva developed into an adult female, which produced viable eggs but was much smaller than those obtained from pine bolts. The results did not exclude the possibility that M. alternatus can use recently killed C japonica trees as a host.																	1341-6979					FEB	2006	11	1					35	40		10.1007/s10310-005-0184-5								WOS:000235285400005						
J	Daunt, F; Afanasyev, V; Silk, JRD; Wanless, S				Daunt, F; Afanasyev, V; Silk, JRD; Wanless, S			Extrinsic and intrinsic determinants of winter foraging and breeding phenology in a temperate seabird	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY												In temperate regions, winter presents animals with a number of challenges including depressed food abundance, increased daily energy requirements, higher frequency of extreme weather events and shortened day length. Overcoming these constraints is critical for overwintering survival and scheduling of future breeding of long-lived species and is likely to be state dependent, associated with intrinsic abilities such as food acquisition rates. We examined the relationship between environmental and intrinsic factors on overwintering foraging and subsequent breeding phenology of the European shag Phalacrocorax aristotelis, a diurnal marine predator. We tested a range of hypotheses relating to overwintering foraging time and location. We found that individuals greatly increased their foraging time in winter to a peak of more than 90% of available daylight at the winter solstice. The seasonal patterns of foraging time appear to be driven by a combination of light levels and weather conditions and may be linked to the availability of the shag's principal prey, the lesser sandeel Ammodytes marinus. There was no evidence that shags dispersed south in winter to increase potential foraging time. Foraging time decreased after the winter solstice and, crucially, was correlated with subsequent breeding phenology, such that individuals that spent less time foraging in February bred earlier. The relationship was much stronger in females than males, in line with their more direct control of timing of breeding. Our results demonstrate that pre-breeding intrinsic foraging ability is critical in determining breeding phenology.

J	Milbrath, LR; DeLoach, CJ				Milbrath, LR; DeLoach, CJ			Host specificity of different populations of the leaf beetle Diorhabda elongata (Coleoptera : Chrysomelidae), a biological control agent of saltcedar (Tamarix spp.)	BIOLOGICAL CONTROL												The leaf beetle, Diorhabda elongata (Brulle) sensu lato, was released in 2001 for the classical biological control of exotic saltcedars, a complex of invasive Tamarix species and hybrids. It did not establish at sites south of 37 degrees N latitude where summer daylengths are below the critical photoperiod of the northern-adapted populations of the beetle that were released. Therefore, we assessed the host specificity of four D. elongata populations collected from more southern latitudes in the Old World (Tunisia, Crete, Uzbekistan, and Turpan, China). All populations were similar to each other and the previously released populations of D. elongata in their host specificity. Larval/pupal survival for all populations was 34-100% on Tamarix test plants, 0-76% on native Frankenia plants (both in the order Tamaricales), and 0% on the remaining 28 species of plants on which all the larvae died as 1st instars. D. elongata laid high numbers of eggs on saltcedar, generally fewer eggs on athel (a moderately valued evergreen species of Tamarix) except for Uzbekistan beetles, and few to no eggs on three species of Frankenia. Few to no adults were found on Frankenia plants which also were poor maintenance hosts. The release of any of the four D. elongata populations in the southern US and northern Mexico should pose no risk to plants outside the order Tamaricales and a low risk to native, non-target Frankenia plants. Athel may be less damaged than saltcedar. Published by Elsevier Inc.																	1049-9644					JAN	2006	36	1					32	48		10.1016/j.biocontrol.2005.09.008								WOS:000234438000004						
J	Moore, IT; Bentley, GE; Wotus, C; Wingfield, JC				Moore, IT; Bentley, GE; Wotus, C; Wingfield, JC			Photoperiod-independent changes in immunoreactive brain gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in a free-living, tropical bird	BRAIN BEHAVIOR AND EVOLUTION												Timing of seasonal reproduction in high latitude vertebrates is generally regulated by photoperiodic cues. Increasing day length in the spring is associated with changes in the brain that are responsible for mediating reproductive activities. A primary example of this is the increased content of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in the preoptic area of the hypothalamus in birds as they enter the spring breeding season. Increased GnRH activity stimulates the release of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone from the anterior pituitary. These gonadotropins induce growth of the gonads and release of sex steroids which act on the brain to mediate reproductive behaviors. By contrast, seasonal breeding in the tropics can occur in the absence of significant changes in photoperiod. To our knowledge, no studies have investigated whether seasonal breeding in free-living tropical vertebrates is associated with seasonal changes in the GnRH system. We studied two populations of rufous-collared sparrows (Zonotrichia capensis) at the equator, separated by only 25 km, but with asynchronous reproductive phenologies associated with local climate and independent of photoperiodic cues. We collected brains and measured GnRH immunoreactivity (GnRH-ir) during each population's breeding and non-breeding periods. Breeding males had larger, but not more, GnRH-ir cells than non-breeding birds. The plasticity of the GnRH system was associated with local climate, such that the two populations exhibited asynchronous changes in GnRH-ir despite experiencing identical photoperiod conditions. Our results demonstrate that tropical birds can exhibit neural changes similar to those exhibited in higher latitude birds. However, these tropical populations appear to be using supplementary cues (e.g., rainfall, temperature, food availability) in a similar way to higher latitude species using an initial predictive cue (photoperiod). These results raise questions about the evolution of reliance upon photoperiodism and the strength of reproductive responses to other environmental cues in congeners from higher latitudes. The ability to respond to a multitude of environmental cues might be part of the ancestral condition, and the subsequent obligate photoperiodism in high-latitude congeners could reflect a loss of flexibility in response to environmental signals.

J	Danks, HV				Danks, HV			Insect adaptations to cold and changing environments	CANADIAN ENTOMOLOGIST					Symposium on Adaptations and Constraints in honor of Richard Ring held at the Annual Meeting of the Entomological-Society-of-Canada	NOV 03, 2003	Kelowna, CANADA	Entomol Soc Canada				A review of insect adaptations for resistance to cold and for life-cycle timing reveals the complexity of the adaptations and their relationships to features of the environment. Cold hardiness is a complex and dynamic state that differs widely among species. Surviving cold depends on habitat choice, relationships with ice and water, and synthesis of a variety of cryoprotectant molecules. Many aspects are time-dependent and are integrated with other factors such as taxonomic affinity, resource availability, natural enemies, and diapause. Timing adaptations reflect the fact that all environments change over many different time frames, from days to thousands of years. Environments differ in severity and in the extent, nature, variability, and predictability of change, as well as in how reliably cues indicate probable conditions in the future. These differences Lire reflected by a wide range of insect life-cycle systems, life-cycle delays, levels of responsiveness to various environmental signals, genetic systems, and circadian responses. In particular, the degree of environmental change, its predictability on different time frames, and whether it can be monitored effectively dictate the balance between fixed and flexible timing responses. These same environmental features have to be characterized to understand cold hardiness, but this has not yet been done. Therefore, the following key questions must be answered in order to put cold hardiness into the necessary ecological context: How much do conditions change? How consistent is the change? How reliable are environmental signals?																	0008-347X	1918-3240				JAN-FEB	2006	138	1					1	23										WOS:000237124200003

During 3 years of study, about 50% of the nests we monitored harboured hatchlings during winter, and the majority (87%) of these individuals survived despite being intermittently exposed to subfreezing temperatures. Most such exposures were brief (ca. 12 h) and mild (minimum temperature: ca. -1.2 degrees C); however, turtles were occasionally subjected to longer chilling episodes and lower temperatures. In laboratory experiments, hatchlings supercooled extensively, attaining ca. -15 degrees C before spontaneously freezing. However, they were highly susceptible to inoculative freezing through contact with external ice and (or) ice-nucleating agents, which occur in nesting soil. Therefore, freeze avoidance through supercooling does not appear to be a viable cold-hardiness strategy in these turtles. Hatchlings subjected to experimental freezing survived exposure to temperatures as low as -3.0 degrees C suggesting that freeze tolerance may account for the high winter survival observed in natural nests. We conclude that freeze tolerance in hatchling M. terrapin is promoted by high susceptibility to inoculation, which is known to moderate freezing, allowing cells time to adapt to the attendant physical and osmotic stresses.																	0008-4301					JAN	2006	84	1					116	124		10.1139/Z05-183								WOS:000236285900014						
J	Pajuste, K; Frey, J; Asi, E				Pajuste, K; Frey, J; Asi, E			Interactions of atmospheric deposition with coniferous canopies in Estonia	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Throughfall and open field bulk precipitation were measured at three coniferous sites during 1995-2002 in the framework of ICP Integrated Monitoring and at five coniferous sites during 1996-2002 in the framework of ICP Forests (Level II). The coniferous canopies acted as a sink for nitrate and ammonium and as a source for base cations: Ca2+, Mg2+ and K+. The estimated share of SO4-S dry deposition from total deposition was 1.5-4 times higher for dormant period compared to growing period. During the study period average annual throughfall and bulk deposition of SO4-S decreased significantly, 2.8 and 2.3 times, respectively. Throughfall enrichment with base cations increased in the order Mg < Na < Ca < K. Using Na as a tracer ion, average dry deposition and canopy leaching were calculated. Leaching was the dominant process for TF enrichment by potassium. Leaching of base cations occurred during growing as well as dormant period. The calculated internal flux of Ca2+ and Mg2+ varied in the range of 0.6-2.0 and 0.6-1.2 kg ha(-1) per year in spruce and pine stands, respectively. The internal circulation of K+ was significantly higher (8.9-10.9 kg ha(-1) per year) in spruce stands than in pine stands (2.7-4.4 kg ha(-1) per year).																	0167-6369					JAN	2006	112	1-3					177	196		10.1007/s10661-006-0360-x								WOS:000234571500010	16404540

We combined diapause and development in a day- degree model of A. orana phenology. Each year adult activity occurred in early May or after 418 day- degrees had been accumulated from 1 February, when diapause development is completed. Larval activity began in early spring ( March). According to larval instar distribution, by October diapause course is irreversible. Combining data on trap captures and larval activity reveals three distinct generations in the area. Larval densities increased at the end of summer when also fruit damage is possible. Three parasitoids were identified, Colpoclypeus florus being the most abundant. Applying the Weibull function and a logistic distribution to cumulative percentage of trap captures and larval development, respectively, the phenology of A. orana is forecasted with the accumulated day- degrees. The prediction of the models agrees well with the observed flight curves of A. orana males. The practical implications concerning population dynamics and use of the models for control of this pest are discussed.

The overall objective of the program is to identify suitable husbandry conditions for maintaining multi-generation populations of this species in the laboratory for use in ecotoxicological testing. In this article, we focus on the effects of photoperiod, temperature, and population density on adult fecundity and juvenile growth. Increasing photoperiod from 12 to 16 h of light per day had no effect on adult fecundity or egg hatching and relatively minor effects on juvenile growth and development. Rearing snails at temperatures between 22 degrees C and 28 degrees C did not influence the rates of egg production or egg clutch size. However, the rates of growth and development (of eggs and juveniles) increased with increasing temperature in this range, and when temperatures were reduced to 22 degrees C egg-hatching success was impaired. Juvenile growth and development were more sensitive to rearing density than adult fecundity traits. On the basis of the present results, we conclude that rearing individuals of M. cornuarietis at a temperature of 25 degrees C, a photoperiod of 12L:12D, and a density of < 0.8 snails L-1 (with lower densities for juvenile snails) should provide favorable husbandry conditions for maintaining multi-generation populations of this species.

The percentage of newly emerging females with immature ovaries was significantly lower in one of the Kagoshima populations, KGS1 (12%) than in the other four populations (51-66%). The mean preoviposition period was significantly shorter in the Kochi population, KCH (1.8 d) than in the Kyoto population (7.8 d), and oviposition was more incessant in the former than in the latter. KGS1 and KCH, which showed a weaker diapause response, are considered to be better candidates for the biological control of pest aphids in winter greenhouses because they arc more likely to be active during the winter.																	0021-4914						2006	50	1					72	74		10.1303/jjaez.2006.72								WOS:000236832700013

Invasion risk of active and diapausing invertebrates from residual ballast in ships entering Chesapeake Bay	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												We examined the invasion risk posed by active invertebrates and their diapausing stages (e.g. resting eggs, quiescent adults) carried in residual sediment and water of non-ballasted ships to Chesapeake Bay. Many taxa were recorded that are not native to Chesapeake Bay, supporting the contention that residual ballast represents an invasion vector of some risk to marine systems. Composition and propagule supply differed relative to that in ships entering the Laurentian Great Lakes (e.g. marine taxa dominated in Chesapeake Bay ships), indicating that risk varies geographically. Average abundances of active invertebrates in residual sediment (1002.1 ind. kg(-1)) and water (2.7 ind. 1(-1)), and diapausing eggs in sediments (779.4 eggs kg(-1)), were typically low relative to those in ships entering the Great Lakes (1322.5 ind. kg(-1), 10.9 ind. 1(-1) and 3650.0 eggs kg(-1), respectively). However, due to high variability among ships, differences were not statistically significant. The major cause of composition and abundance differences is dissimilar trade routes between each system, with vessels entering Chesapeake Bay primarily originating from marine rather than freshwater ports, and because diapausing stages are less commonly found among marine invertebrates. Low propagule supplies, predominant intra-continental ship movements, and salinity disparity between the upper (20 to 28 parts per thousand) and lower (3 to 8 parts per thousand) regions of Chesapeake Bay (where ballast water is loaded and offloaded) may greatly reduce invasion risk and be a contributing factor to the bay's low invasion rate: invasion risk from non-ballasted ships here may be low relative to hull fouling or ballast water discharge. Other marine coastal areas may be at greater risk from this vector.

Ocean-scale modelling of the distribution, abundance, and seasonal dynamics of the copepod Calanus finmarchicus	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The copepod Calanus finmarchicus is widely distributed over the sub-polar Atlantic and dominates the mesozooplanktonic biomass in that region. Despite this, all previous C. finmarchicus population modelling studies have been spatially and temporally limited. In this paper we present results from a fully stage-resolved model in a domain spanning the entire geographic range of the species (30 to 80 degrees N and 80 degrees W to 90 degrees E. The model was driven by temperature and transport from the Ocean Circulation and Climate Advanced Modelling project (OCCAM) and phytoplankton food derived from satellite (SeaWiFS) sea-surface colour observations. The resulting quasi-stationary yearly cycle was assessed against seasonally resolved maps of continuous plankton recorder observations, winter cruise data on the distribution of diapausers, and time series from locations distributed over the North Atlantic. The model's high computational efficiency permitted its free parameters to be selected to yield a good correspondence with the field data. We were also able to explore the effects of changing the assumptions regarding diapause and mortality. By falsifying alternative models we conclude that (1) a fixed fraction of each surface generation enters diapause, (2) overwintering individuals enter diapause at the end of the fifth copepodite stage, and (3) mortality is an increasing function of temperature. Finally, we demonstrate that the demographic impact of transport is limited, except in shelf seas and at the edges of the distribution; nevertheless, there is a very high level of population connectivity over the whole domain.

We collected larvae of this rarely found species from two small, kettle hole wetlands on Cape Cod, MA. The life cycle and behavior are similar to the New Brunswick population studied by Fairchild and Wiggins (1989). Habitat characteristics distinguishing wetlands where P. canadensis occurs include dominance by Sphagnum sp., shrub cover, and low pH. Narrow habitat requirements, summer dormancy, and late adult emergence may limit this species' appearance in collections.

J	Huestis, DL; Marshall, JL				Huestis, DL; Marshall, JL			Interaction between maternal effects and temperature affects diapause occurrence in the cricket Allonemobius socius	OECOLOGIA												The induction of diapause can be adaptive for egg survival during unfavorable conditions, while direct development can be advantageous under favorable conditions by allowing additional generations to exploit abundant resources. Therefore, the physiological capability of a female to respond to environmental cues indicative of habitat quality by producing eggs of the appropriate developmental phenotype should be under strong selection. Additionally, developing embryos may alter the developmental trajectory initiated by the female in response to changing environmental conditions. In this study, we used a cross-fostering approach to isolate the maternal effects of parental diapause history (not previously studied) and egg-laying temperature from the influence of the incubation environment experienced by the developing embryo on the proportion of diapause eggs produced by the striped ground cricket, Allonemobius socius. We found that an interaction between egg-incubation temperature and parental diapause history strongly affected the proportion of diapause eggs produced and the proportion of eggs that hatched within a 16-18 day incubation period, while egg-laying temperature and all other interactions did not. These novel results indicate that embryos can respond directly to the environmental conditions they experience during development, but that their ability to do so is influenced by maternal effects such as parental diapause history. The results of this study not only provide evidence, for the first time, of parental diapause history affecting diapause proportions, but also raise additional questions about the mechanism by which environmental information is transmitted from parent to offspring and how offspring are able to respond to conditions experienced during their own development.

Dispersal - Limited biodiversity of tropical insular streams	POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY					4th Symposium for European Freshwater Science (SEFS 4)	AUG, 2005	Jagiellonian Univ, Cracow, POLAND		Jagiellonian Univ			Numerous species are adapted for colonization of insular fresh waters by using different mechanisms of active and passive dispersal, especially among oceanic islands at low latitudes. Over time, similar animal communities have assembled in many tropical streams and rivers on isolated islands. These freshwater communities are characterized by a relatively low number of species of fishes, decapods, gastropods and insects that typically have complex life cycles including passive, long-distance dispersal. These species often disperse during marine phases with drifting larvae or by rafting and aerial transport of resistant, dormant stages. Active dispersal is sometimes effective for relatively short-distance movements from one island's streams to another island's nearby drainage basin within an archipelago (a "stepping-stones" dispersal pattern). Identifying distinct differences among aquatic communities on "true oceanic" islands of different ages and geologic histories requires a long-term biogeographic perspective including the degree of spatial isolation of populations and differences in rates of speciation. Consequently, the total biodiversity of insular streams is a complex combination of dispersal from multiple sources of species from continents and other islands, as well as evolution of new endemics. Recolonization of streams following natural disturbances and the impacts of introduced species result in dynamic changes in species accumulation and turnover in these insular freshwater ecosystems. Analysis of dispersal to islands provides general perspectives on managing fragmented habitats, especially the effects of invasive species that also shed light on factors affecting the equilibrium composition of animal communities in island-like ecosystems on continents.																	1505-2249						2006	54	4					523	547										WOS:000243236300002

Ephippia may serve for temporal escape and recolonisation of the habitat or for geographical dispersal and colonisation of other habitats. While dormancy and dispersal of ephippia have been well studied, initial factors determining the fate of the ephippia have remained unknown. We first consider the fate of an ephippium that sinks to the bottom of the water body, where it enriches the egg bank present in the sediments. We then discuss the potential and evidence for dispersal of ephippia, which is probably facilitated by their flotation on the water surface. Finally, we concentrate on the moment of the release of the ephippium showing a likely mechanism that determines its further fate - temporal or spatial dispersal - and we demonstrate it to be accomplished through maternal behaviour.

Breaking seed coat dormancy in Macrotyloma daltonii	RANGELAND JOURNAL												Methods for breaking hard seed to allow germination of 2 seedlots of Macrotyloma daltonii (Webb) Verdc., were investigated. Treatments included soaking, application of dry heat, hot water, acid scarification, sand paper scarification, pre-chilling, alone and in combination with acid and dry heat. The treated seeds were tested for germination over 21 days in an incubator with 12 h of light and 12 h of darkness and temperatures of 25 and 18 degrees C during the light and dark phases, respectively. A 20-min exposure to 98% concentrated sulphuric acid was most effective in increasing germination from 10 to 80% in seedlot 1. The 10-min acid treatment increased germination from 21 to 38% in seedlot 2, but 20 min reduced germination and increased the number of dead seeds. Seedlot 1 had greater levels of hard seed (88%) than seedlot 2 (61%). Soaking, hot water, dry heating, pre-chilling, or sandpaper scarification were not effective in breaking hard seed in either seedlot 1 or 2. Combining pre-chilling with 10 min of acid treatment damaged seed and impaired germination across the 2 seedlots. The range of pre-sowing seed treatments that indicated positive effects on germination, particularly acid treatments need to be further investigated in the field under different pedo-climatic conditions to allow appropriate rangeland management options to be developed.

Dependence on vision should be problematic for species wintering at high latitudes, as they face very low light levels for extended periods during the Polar night. We examined the foraging rhythms of male great cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo) wintering north of the Polar circle in West Greenland, conducting the first year-round recordings of the diving activity in a seabird wintering at high latitudes. Dive depth data revealed that birds dived every day during the Arctic winter and did not adjust their foraging rhythms to varying day length. Therefore, a significant proportion of the dive bouts were conducted in the dark (less than 1 lux) during the Polar night. Our study underlines the stunning adaptability of great cormorants and raises questions about the capacity of diving birds to use non-visual cues to target fish.																	1744-9561					DEC 22	2005	1	4					469	471		10.1098/rsbl.2005.0356								WOS:000233911600024	17148235					
J	Burke, S; Pullin, AS; Wilson, RJ; Thomas, CD				Burke, S; Pullin, AS; Wilson, RJ; Thomas, CD			Selection for discontinuous life-history traits along a continuous thermal gradient in the butterfly Aricia agestis	ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												1. Voltinism may be conceptualised as the product of development rate and the timing of diapause - two components that together translate gradual environmental variation, through periods of growth and development, into 'generational units'. This may result in very different selection pressures on diapause induction and development time in populations with different numbers of generations per year. 2. Developmental data from univoltine and bivoltine populations of the butterfly Aricia agestis (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae) in North Wales were used to examine larval development time and the timing of diapause, and their contribution towards voltinism in populations that occur at the same latitude and in geographic proximity to one another along a thermal gradient. 3. The critical photoperiod for diapause induction in univoltines and bivoltines from the same latitude differed by more than 1.5 h. 4. Development time also differed significantly between these populations, in line with predictions that bivoltines would need to exhibit shorter development times in order to achieve two complete generations per year. Shorter development times for bivoltines result in lower pupal weights, suggesting a trade-off exists between generation number and body size that may dictate the position of the transition zone between the two life-history strategies. Analysis of development times in a third population, from southern England, with greater thermal availability than those from North Wales, further supports this hypothesised trade-off. 5. To achieve the conversion of a continuous thermal gradient into the binary biological response from univoltism to bivoltism, bivoltines speed up development, reduce adult body size and shift their diapause induction response.

Merrill, and has the potential to colonize a large geographic range throughout a single growing season, Our objectives were to describe colonization patterns on a statewide spatial and temporal scale, examine the changing proportion of winged forms throughout a season, and assess photoperiod as a potential trigger for alate production. In Minnesota, we define initial colonization as the period of time during the early vegetative growth when alates were present and alatoid nymphs were absent on soybean. Initial colonization during 2002 and 2003 was similar to 2 wk. On average across Minnesota, summer migrants were first produced when most fields were at the initial flowering stages in 2002. In 2003, an outbreak year, initial detection of summer migrants occurred earlier during vegetative stages before flowering. The significant increase in the proportion of all potential migratory forms (i.e., alatoid nymphs and adults) occurred during the beginning of seed set for both years. During seed set, the mean proportion of alate A. glycines was 0.15 +/- 0.04 (SE) in 2002 and 0.16 +/- 0.06 in 2003. The mean proportion of alatoid nymph A. glycines was 0.14 +/- 0.04 in 2002 and 0.29 +/- 0.04 in 2003 during seed set. The total mean proportion of migratory fort-as was higher when the critical L:D photoperiod was 14.5:9.5 b/d. A regression analysis also indicated the proportion of winged A. glycines increased with decreasing photoperiod.																	0046-225X					DEC	2005	34	6					1456	1463		10.1603/0046-225X-34.6.1456								WOS:000234031400011						
J	Schmidt, PS; Paaby, AB; Heschel, MS				Schmidt, PS; Paaby, AB; Heschel, MS			Genetic variance for diapause expression and associated life histories in Drosophila melanogaster	EVOLUTION												The dipteran Drosophila melanogaster can express a form of reproductive quiescence or diapause when exposed to low temperature and shortened photoperiod. Among natural populations in the eastern United States, the frequency of lines that express reproductive diapause in the laboratory varies substantially and predictably with latitudinal origin. The goals of the present study were twofold: (1) to examine the impact of genetic variance for diapause expression on multiple traits associated with organismal fitness; and (2) to evaluate the potential for fitness trade-offs between diapause and nondiapause phenotypes that may result in the observed cline. Even prior to diapause entry or expression, inbred lines that express and do not express reproductive diapause in laboratory assays were constitutively distinct for life span, age-specific mortality rates, fecundity profiles, resistance to cold and starvation stress, lipid content, development time, and egg-to-adult viability. Furthermore, estimates of genetic correlations based on line means revealed significant differentiation for genetic variance/covariance matrices between diapause and nondiapause lines. The data indicate the potential for life-history trade-offs associated with variation for the diapause phenotype. The observed cline in diapause incidence in the eastern United States may be generated by these trade-offs and the associated spatial and/or temporal variation in relative fitness of these two phenotypes in natural populations.																	0014-3820					DEC	2005	59	12					2616	2625										WOS:000234502400012	16526509

Social insects are the canonical example of polyphenism with the development of castes in the colonies. However, aphids display one of the largest range of polyphenisms, notably by producing winged or wingless, as well as asexual or sexual forms, depending on environmental conditions. During spring and summer, aphids reproduce by viviparous parthenogenesis, whereas in autumn they enter sexual reproduction. This switch in reproductive mode is triggered by changes in photoperiod and temperature. Here, the data accumulated since the 1960s on the identification of photoperiodic clocks, counter and putative neural photoreceptors that participate in this reproductive shift are reviewed. After perception, the photoperiodic signal is transduced through the secretion of hormones (juvenile hormones may well be involved) which, in turn, may act on the target cells, namely the oocytes. In short-day conditions, oocytes enter meiosis and produce haploid eggs which develop a 2n embryo after fertilisation. By contrast in long-day conditions, a single maturation division produces 2n oocytes which immediately enter parthenogenetic embryogenesis. A physiological model of the determination of sexual vs. asexual reproduction in aphids is proposed and viewed from the perspective of newly initiated molecular studies.

The construct linking these factors is an attitude that assumes responsibility for places and emerges as congruent spatial behavior. The community-security paradigm proposed here as a strategy in the generation of habitable (thus safe) and socially sustainable urban environments has as its antithesis the realm of the dormant domain - isolating and ambiguous public open spaces, alienating parks, blind carparks, silent suburbs and shopping malls, and railway stations and city centers deserted at night. The approach involves a range of spatial design and place management issues, all of which are mutually interdependent.																	0738-0895					WIN	2005	22	4					305	318										WOS:000234544900004						
J	Kemp, WP; Bosch, J				Kemp, WP; Bosch, J			Effect of temperature on Osmia lignaria (Hymenoptera : Megachilidae) prepupa-adult development, survival, and emergence	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY												The solitary bee Osmia lignaria Say continues to be developed as an orchard pollinator in the United States and southern Canada. Female bees are active during the early spring and construct nests consisting of a linear series of unlined cells delimited by mud partitions. Cells are provisioned with a pollen/nectar mass on which an egg is deposited, and nests are sealed with a mud plug. In 1997, we initiated two experiments on the development, mortality, and emergence of O. lignaria at selected laboratory temperature regimes and outdoors. In the first experiment (published previously), we compared temperature treatments for their adequacy in maintaining healthy O. lignaria populations. In a second experiment (reported here), we determined the relationship between rearing temperatures and prepupa-adult development rates as well as emergence time and longevity after wintering and incubation the following spring. We observed important differences in O. lignaria prepupa versus pupa responses to selected temperature treatments. The relationship between temperature and days to pupa was U-shaped, with additional time to transit the prepupa-pupa interval at temperatures above and below 26 degrees C. The negative relationship between temperature and the length of the pupa to adult interval contrasts with the U-shaped thermal response observed for prepupae. Thus, with each increase in thermal beat units over the range of temperature treatments tested, we observed an additional reduction in the pupa-adult interval. Individuals reared at constant 18 degrees C required 2.4 times as many days to transit the pupa-adult interval compared with those at constant 32 degrees C. Our results suggest that there is a need for the development of regionally adapted, latitude-specific breeding populations of this outstanding orchard crop pollinator.

Vill., foliage infected and uninfected with Tomato spotted wilt virus (family Bunyaviridae, genus Tospovirus, TSWV) on the ovipositional preferences of western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande), and tobacco thrips, Frankliniella fusca (Hinds), were investigated for whole plants in the greenhouse. In addition, the preference for leaf disks from the same host plants was investigated under a range of temperatures, 15-30 degrees C at a photoperiod of 12:12 (L:D) h, and at three photoperiods, 6:18, 12:12, and 18:6, at 20 degrees C in no-choice and choice studies conducted in growth chambers. In a choice test, F. fusca oviposited significantly more eggs per whole plant foliage over a 7-d period than E occidentalis by an average ratio of 3:1 over both tomato and chickweed. The optimum temperature for oviposition of F. occidentalis and E fusca was 24.5 and 24.9 degrees C, respectively. Both species laid significantly more eggs under the longest daylight hours tested, 18:6, in the choice study. Temperature and photoperiod did not significantly interact in terms of thrips ovipositional preference. Ovipositional preference for chickweed or tomato foliage was different for each thrips species in the choice and no-choice tests. However, both thrips species laid significantly more eggs per square centimeter of leaf area in chickweed than in tomato in the whole plant choice test.																	0022-0493					DEC	2005	98	6					2107	2113		10.1093/jee/98.6.2107								WOS:000233999500049	16539139

The cold adaptations of populations from northern Indiana (similar to 41 degrees 45' N) and Alaska were compared and, as expected, the supercooling points (the temperatures at which they froze) of these freeze-avoiding insects were significantly lower in Alaska insects. Both populations produce glycerol, but the concentrations in Alaska larvae were much higher than in Indiana insects (similar to 2.2 and 0.5 mol l(-1), respectively). In addition, both populations produce antifreeze proteins. Interestingly, in the autumn both populations have the same approximate level of hemolymph thermal hysteresis, indicative of antifreeze protein activity, suggesting that they synthesize similar amounts of antifreeze protein. A major difference is that the Alaska larvae undergo extreme dehydration in winter wherein water content decreases from 63-65% body water (1.70-1.85 g H2O g(-1) dry mass) in summer to 28-40% body water (0.40-0.68 g H2O g(-1) dry mass) in winter. These 2.5-4.6-fold reductions in body water greatly increase the concentrations of antifreeze in the Alaska insects. Glycerol concentrations would increase to 7-10 mol l(-1) while thermal hysteresis increased to nearly 13 degrees C (the highest ever measured in any organism) in concentrated hemolymph. By contrast, Indiana larvae do not desiccate in winter. The Alaska population also undergoes a diapause while insects from Indiana do not. The result of these, and likely additional, adaptations is that while the mean winter supercooling points of Indiana larvae were approximately -23 degrees C, those of Alaska larvae were -35 to -42 degrees C, and at certain times Alaska C. clavipes did not freeze when cooled to -80 degrees C.

J	Angeler, DG; Garcia, G				Angeler, DG; Garcia, G			Using emergence from soil propagule banks as indicators of ecological integrity in wetlands: advantages and limitations	JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY												Wetland soils contain a reservoir of dormant plant seeds and invertebrate eggs, collectively termed the seed or propagule bank, which integrate spatiotemporal variation at various levels of biology (genetic, phenotypic, species, and community). Several recent studies suggest that anthropogenic physical or chemical stressors may disrupt the process of emergence from propagule banks. This process is often the single most important colonization process in wetlands isolated geographically from other water bodies. The potential for disruption of emergence can be exploited as a useful indicator of anthropogenic stress. The aim of our paper is to provide a conceptual framework that shows the advantages and limitations of wetland propagule banks as indicators of anthropogenic stress or ecological integrity. This framework describes mechanistic responses of propagule banks to stressors and makes recommendations on experimental approaches for the evaluation of cause-effect relationships between stressors and propagule bank responses. This indicator could help bridge the current gap between basic and applied wetland ecology and could find application in future wetland management and restoration strategies.

As little is known about the effects of photoperiod on torpor in subtropical species, we investigated whether, and if so how, torpor use, duration, and depth are affected by acclimation to three photoperiods (short, intermediate, long) in the blossom-bat Syconycteris australis. In contrast to many other studies, torpor occurrence, duration, and depth did not significantly respond to photoperiod acclimation in S. australis. Interestingly, the trend of a decline in torpor use under long photoperiod was the opposite of that observed previously in S. australis, which had been captured from the wild in summer and winter. Our study suggests that some species living in low latitude areas with unpredictable weather like S. australis may not use photoperiod for seasonal adjustments in physiology because it is not a reliable cue for food availability.

J	Orr, SP; Rudgers, JA; Clay, K				Orr, SP; Rudgers, JA; Clay, K			Invasive plants can inhibit native tree seedlings: testing potential allelopathic mechanisms	PLANT ECOLOGY												The mechanisms by which invasive species affect native communities are not well resolved. For example, invasive plants may influence other species through competition, altered ecosystem processes, or other pathways. We investigated one potential mechanism by which invasive plants may harm native species, allelopathy. Specifically, we explored whether native tree species respond differently to potential allelopathic effects of two invasive plant species. We assessed the separate effects of Lolium arundinaceam (tall fescue) and Elaeagnus umbellata (autumn olive) on three common successional tree species: Acer saccharinum (silver maple), Populus deltoides (eastern cottonwood), and Platanus occidentalis (sycamore). Tall fescue and autumn olive are widely planted and highly invasive or persistent throughout North America where they often grow in forest edges, old fields, and other sites colonized by pioneering tree species. In an exploratory greenhouse experiment, we applied aqueous extracts derived from soil, leaf litter, or live leaves to native trees. We compared these treatments to a sterile water control and also to minced leaves leached in water, a common, but potentially less realistic method of testing for allelopathy. For all tree species, minced leaves from tall fescue reduced the probability that seedlings emerged, and minced leaves of autumn olive reduced the number of days to emergence. During other demographic stages, the three native tree species diverged in their responses to the invasive plants. Platanus occidentalis exhibited the widest range of responses, with reduced root biomass due to minced tissue from both invasive species, reduced days to emergence and marginally reduced survival from minced tall fescue, and reduced leaf biomass from tall fescue leaf litter. Populus deltoides appeared insensitive to most extracts, although survival was marginally increased with application of minced or fresh leaf extracts from autumn olive. In addition, minced tall fescue shortened the time to seedling emergence for Acer saccharinum, potentially a positive effect. Overall, results suggest that allelopathy may be one mechanism underlying the negative impacts of tall fescue and autumn olive on other plant species, but that effects can depend strongly upon the source of allelochemicals and the tree species examined.

Serum samples from 208 sheep were obtained prior to be slaughtered, and then heads were removed and cut open along their longitudinal axis to collect the parasites from the nasal cavities, turbinates and sinus. Besides this, blood samples were monthly collected from the lambs of G-1 (maintained under field conditions) and the lambs of G-2 (kept housed since birth to avoid Oestrus infestations) throughout a year. In the sheep, a positive significant correlation was observed between the number of first instar O. ovis larvae and the values of IgM, and between the second instar larvae and the IgG optical densities. In the lambs, all classes of antibodies increased significantly from July in G-1. The highest values of IgG were reached in September (IgG) and decreased in November-December. The IgM response peaked in November, and very low values of IgA were observed during the study. Matching these data with chronobiology of O. ovis in this region, we conclude that the first infection occurs on May, stimulating the production of humoral antibodies. The reduction of the IgG antibody levels starting from October means the beginning of the diapause while the IgM response seems to be associated to the presence of L 1 in the nasal cavities. The data obtained led us to forecast an early treatment of the ovine on June-July, which should keep away from the maturation of O. ovis L I larvae, avoiding the development of clinical lesions and interrupting the life cycle of this parasite.

Its most recent eruption that began in April 2003 was preceded by an eruption between January and May 2002. Thermal infrared images from the Japanese-United States' Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection radiometer (ASTER-5 TIR channels, 8-12 mu m, 90 m/pixel, Noise Equivalent Delta Temperature [NE Delta T] similar to 0.1-0.3 K; onboard the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Terra polar-orbiting spacecraft) of a snow-covered Chikurachki Volcano taken in January 2003 show muted evidence of thermal activity. ASTER thermal infrared (TIR) images from February 2003, however, indicate warmer areas within the summit crater. Average whole-pixel temperatures of adjacent summit slopes are in the range of 250-252 K, while many summit-crater whole pixel temperatures are similar to 2-6 K greater. A two component Planck solution for the warmer pixels yields a solution of 275-277 K for 10-15% of the Chikurachki summit crater and 285-295 K for 25-35% of a prominent "botspot" on its flank. An interpretation of this enhanced pre-eruption beat flow is the presence of surface melt water. The detection in ASTER data of such subtle precursory heat-flow enhancement, even retrospectively, raises important issues for remote monitoring of "dormant" snow-capped volcanoes, especially those that threaten nearby populations, like Mt.

Consequently, their conservation requires habitat protection and management at the landscape scale. In some cases. reintroduction might be used to support remnant or restore extinct populations. This is the case for the brown bear (Ursus arctos) in the Italian Alps. We monitored spacing behavior and settlement of reintroduced brown bears in Adamello-Brenta Natural Park, North-Italy, using radio-tracking. Habitat use, dispersion and survival were studied to evaluate the success of reintroduction and possible conflicts with man. All three males and five of seven females settled in the study area. Most bears roamed widely the first months after release, exploring the new habitat. Patterns of home range overlap between seasons and years revealed that home range use stabilized the year after first hibernation. Home ranges were larger in the mating season (May-July) than in spring or autumn. Home ranges varied between 34 and 1813 km(2) the year after release. but core-areas. where feeding activity was concentrated, were much smaller. Some bears had exclusive core-areas in summer and autumn, but most showed considerable core-area overlap with animals of the same and/or the opposite sex. Bears selected deciduous forests, mixed and conifer forests were used according to availability, and areas with anthropogenic disturbance were avoided. Most bears settled and some reproduced successfully at the release site, causing high initial population growth, suggesting that reintroduction call help to re-establish a brown bear Population in the Italian Alps.

Support for this hypothesis comes from comparisons of natural pupation sites of species monomorphic and dimorphic for pupal color. Here, we show that interspecific differences in pupation site preferences in nature are to a large extent mimicked in a controlled common garden experiment, suggesting that these differences are genetic. We gave larvae of three swallowtail species a choice of yellow and blue surfaces for pupation. Given the absorption spectra of green vegetation and the spectral sensitivities of the larval eyes, yellow and blue surfaces should be strong indicators of green and brown pupation sites, respectively. Papilio glaucus L., which produces only brown pupae and pupates near the ground in nature, chose to pupate near the bottom of the blue surfaces. In contrast, Battus philenor (L.) and Eurytides marcellus (Cramer), which produce dimorphic pupae, chose to pupate on both yellow and blue surfaces. B. philenor typically chose sites on blue surfaces that were significantly higher than were those of P. glaucus. We also found no differences between geographic populations of B. philenor. The distribution of pupation heights for E. marcellus was bimodal, possibly indicating a genetic polymorphism in pupation site preference. In a separate experiment, we asked whether rearing photoperiod affected pupation site preferences in Papilio polyxenes F. as suggested by observations in the field. Our results showed a clear effect, with larvae choosing only brown pupation sites when reared on an autumnal photoperiod.																	0013-8746					NOV	2005	98	6					996	1001		10.1603/0013-8746(2005)098[0996:ICOPSP]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000233210400027

The developmental zero of M. desjardinsi larvae was higher than that of C. nipponensis larvae. The developmental zeros of C. carnea and C. nipponensis in earlier reports were similar to that of C. nipponensis in the present study. On the other hand, that of M. desjardinsi in earlier studies was somewhat higher than that of U. desjardinsi in the present study. A lower survival rate of C. nipponensis was observed in the cocoon stage at 15.0 degrees C. On the other hand, lower survival rates of A4. desjardinsi were observed in the egg stage at 30.0 degrees C and in the cocoon stage at 15.0, 27.5 and 30.0 degrees C. The body size of both green lacewings was affected by temperature throughout the range tested. Smaller body sizes of M. desjardinsi and C. nipponensis adults were observed at 15.0. 27.5 and 30.0 degrees C. These results indicate that C. nipponensis has a wider optimum range of temperature for immature development than A4. desjardinsi.																	0003-6862					NOV	2005	40	4					615	620		10.1303/aez.2005.615								WOS:000234584400010

The duration of all stages decreased as the temperature increased from 18 to 30 degrees C. Developmental thresholds of 8.1, 10.1 and 9.6 degrees C were estimated for the eggs, nymphs and pre-oviposition period, respectively. Thermal constants of 147 and 370 d-degrees above thresholds of 8.1 and 10.1 degrees C were required for the development of the eggs and nymphs, respectively. The pre-oviposition period required 256 d-degrees above the developmental threshold of 9.6 degrees C. After placing individuals collected in November and February in an incubator in the laboratory, 469.7 d-degrees above 9.6 degrees C, a threshold for nondiapause female adults that was assumed to be equal to that of diapause female adults, were estimated to be required for the pre-oviposition period of individuals that had overwintered. The present results were useful to predict the field population, phenology of L. chinensis in Flyogo Prefecture.																	0003-6862					NOV	2005	40	4					621	624		10.1303/aez.2005.621								WOS:000234584400011

Ten adult moose were radio-collared and monitored with GPS telemetry collars during two contrasting time periods based on food quality and availability: summer (growing period) and winter (dormant and snowy period). According to the habitat productivity - home-range size hypothesis, we expected home-range size and movement rate to be negatively correlated with the proportion of food-rich habitat types in home ranges. Food availability influenced space use, but the effect was more pronounced at the small scale (i.e., movement rates) than at the large scale (i.e., home-range sizes) and during winter than summer. The negative relationship between food availability and home-range size only existed in winter, but movement rates were lower in food-rich habitat types in both time periods. Our results suggested that body size was not the primary factor governing sex-related differences in space use which were likely more related to specific needs of females with regard to the feeding and protection of calves. We suggest that the habitat productivity - home-range size hypothesis may not always be supported when forage is widely distributed and that movement rates can be a better index of forage availability than home-range sizes in such situations.																	0008-4301					NOV	2005	83	11					1431	1437		10.1139/Z05-140								WOS:000234416400005

Cultivation of different subspecies strains of Yersinia pestis isolated from unrelated geographic origins at various temperatures (mammals, 37 degrees C; fleas, 25 degrees C; or winter hibernation, 6 degrees C) affects LPS composition and structure. We tested the susceptibilities of various strains of Y. pestis grown at these different temperatures to PMB and serum bactericidal killing. Both properties varied significantly in response to temperature changes. In Y. pestis subsp. pestis (the main subspecies causing human plague), high levels of resistance to PMB and NHS were detected at 25 degrees C. However, at the same temperature, Y. pestis subsp. caucasica was highly sensitive to PMB. At both of the extreme temperatures, all strains were highly susceptible to PMB. At 25 degrees C and 37 degrees C, Y. pestis subsp. caucasica strain 1146 was highly susceptible to the bactericidal activity of 80% NHS. All Y. pestis strains studied were able to grow in heat-inactivated human serum or in 80% normal mouse serum. At VC, all strains were highly sensitive to NHS. Variations in the PMB resistance of different bacterial cultures related to both the content of cationic components (4-amino-4-deoxyarabinose in lipid A and glycine in the core) and a proper combination of terminal monosaccharides in the LPS. The NHS resistance correlated with an elevated content of N-acetyl-glucosamine in the LPS. Structural variation in the LPS of Y. pestis correlates with the organism's ability to resist innate immunity in both fleas and mammals.

However, relationships between such environmental factors and the daily physical activity of older populations remain unclear. The present study thus examined associations between meteorological variables and the number of steps taken per day by elderly Japanese. Continuous pedometer counts over a 450-day period were collected from 41 healthy subjects (age 71 +/- 4 years), none of whom engaged in any specific occupational activity or exercise programs. An electronic physical activity monitor was attached to a belt worn on the left side of the body throughout the day. Daily values for mean ambient temperature, duration of bright sunshine, mean wind speed, mean relative humidity, and precipitation were obtained from local meteorological stations. The day length was calculated from times of sunrise and sunset. Based on the entire group of 41 subjects (ensemble average), a subject's step count per day decreased exponentially with increasing precipitation (r(2)=0.19, P < 0.05). On days when precipitation was < 1 mm, the step count increased with the mean ambient temperature over the range of -2 to 17 degrees C, but decreased over the range 17-29 degrees C. The daily step count also tended to increase with day length, but the regression coefficient of determination attributable to step count and mean ambient temperature (r(2)=0.32, P < 0.05) exceeded that linking the step count and day length (r(2)=0.13, P < 0.05). The influence of other meteorological factors was small (r(2)<= 0.03) and of little practical significance. On days when precipitation is < 1 mm, physical activity is associated more strongly with ambient temperature than with day length, duration of bright sunshine, wind speed, or relative humidity. Our findings have practical implications for health promotion efforts designed to increase the physical activity of elderly people consistently in the face of seasonal variations in environmental conditions.																	0020-7128					NOV	2005	50	2					83	89		10.1007/s00484-005-0277-z								WOS:000233350800003	16044348					
J	Griffith, TM; Watson, MA				Griffith, TM; Watson, MA			Stress avoidance in a common annual: reproductive timing is important for local adaptation and geographic distribution	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY												Adaptation to local environments may be an important determinant of species' geographic range. However, little is known about which traits contribute to adaptation or whether their further evolution would facilitate range expansion. In this study, we assessed the adaptive value of stress avoidance traits in the common annual Cocklebur (Xanthium strumarium) by performing a reciprocal transplant across a broad latitudinal gradient extending to the species' northern border. Populations were locally adapted and stress avoidance traits accounted for most fitness differences between populations. At the northern border where growing seasons are cooler and shorter, native populations had evolved to reproduce earlier than native populations in the lower latitude gardens. This clinal pattern in reproductive timing corresponded to a shift in selection from favouring later to earlier reproduction. Thus, earlier reproduction is an important adaptation to northern latitudes and constraint on the further evolution of this trait in marginal populations could potentially limit distribution.																	1010-061X					NOV	2005	18	6					1601	1612		10.1111/j.1420-9101.2005.01021.x								WOS:000233146000022	16313471

Reproductive adjustments in deer mice (Peromyscus manicidatus (Wagner, 1845)) from high latitudes are more extensive in response to short days than in deer mice from low latitudes. These adjustments may permit individuals to survive the severe seasonal changes (e.g., temperature and food abundance) in high-latitude environments. Immune function is also affected by photoperiod. Short days were predicted to result in elevated immune and reproductive responses in meadow voles (Microtits pennsylvanicus (Ord, 1815)) from the Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada (similar to 62 degrees N), compared with voles from Ohio (OH), USA (similar to 30 degrees N). Male voles from both latitudes were maintained in long or short days for 10 weeks prior to a delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) immune challenge. Both populations displayed similar testicular regression and reduction of testosterone concentrations in short days. DTH immune responses, however, diverged between the two populations. DTH immune responses were enhanced in long-day NWT voles and short-day OH voles, but decreased in short-day NWT voles and long-day OH voles. Total and free corticosterone concentrations did not explain the latitudinal differences in immune responses. These results suggest that photoperiod affects reproductive and immune systems differently and that immune responses may reflect other environmental factors.

J	Gillespie, DR; Quiring, DMJ				Gillespie, DR; Quiring, DMJ			Diapause induction under greenhouse conditions in two populations of Dicyphus hesperus (Hemiptera : Miridae)	BIOCONTROL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The effects of daylength on induction of reproductive diapause were investigated in two populations of Dicyphus hesperus to determine which was more suitable as a biological control in greenhouses without supplemental light. A population from British Columbia Canada ( 49 degrees 36' N Lat.) had a critical daylength of about 15.5 h, whereas that of a population from California, USA (35 degrees 43' N Lat.) was between 14.0 and 13.5 h. Under natural daylengths in greenhouses at 49 degrees N Lat., females of both populations exhibited reproductive diapause at a daylength that was consistent with their respective critical daylengths. In spring, a lower proportion of both populations diapaused when exposed to diapause-inducing conditions than in autumn. Reproductive diapause of the females of the BC population was 100% in autumn, but half of those females laid eggs when held in the greenhouse for 6 weeks. A maximum of 63% of females of the California population diapaused in autumn, and most began to lay eggs after 2 weeks. The differences in response to daylength presumably reflect differences between the two localities in the reliability of the critical daylength as a predictor of conditions unsuitable for growth and reproduction. Under greenhouse conditions the California population is essentially non-diapausing, and would be the more suitable of the two populations for use as a biological control agent.																	0958-3157					SEP	2005	15	6					571	583		10.1080/09583150500086565								WOS:000230082700003

Lack of successful control in North America resulted in the initiation of a biological control program. We used a combination of field surveys and common garden experiments in Europe to study life history and ecology of a chloropid fly, Platycephala planifrons, to assess its potential as a biological control agent. The fly is widely distributed (in non-flooded sites) throughout Eurasia but attack rates are generally low (mean 5-10%; max. 29%). Adults emerge in late June and may live for several months. Females lay eggs at the base of Ph. australis shoots. First instar larvae of this stem-feeding fly overwinter in dormant below-ground shoots of Ph. australis and rapidly complete development in early spring. Larval feeding destroys the growing meristem of the shoot causing premature wilting and 60-70% reductions in shoot biomass production. Early season attack and considerable impact suggest that Pl. planifrons could be a potent biocontrol agent, if it can escape suppression by natural enemies in the introduced range. However, the generally low attack rates in its native range and its dependence on dry sites appear to make the species a "second-choice" candidate for potential release in North America.

Some populations presented seasonal reproduction while other ones exhibited continuous reproduction. Populations with seasonal reproduction showed two distinct breeding peaks. The first peak in spring was characterized by large gravid females with the greatest fecundity and fertility, the second one, in autumn by small females, exhibiting low fecundity and fertility. Females are able to produce two or three broods per reproductive cycle in populations showing seasonal reproduction, and between four and five in continuously breeding populations. Although oscillating throughout the year, the sex ratio was female-biased in most populations, and differences were highly significant in populations with continuous reproduction. Analysis with the scanning electron microscope showed important phenotypic variation between the populations studied in the form of the pleotelson and its lateral borders that seem to exhibit reliable differences between the specimens examined. These features can be used as discriminating characters between populations of Porcellionides pruinosus.																	0011-216X					SEP	2005	78		8				897	916		10.1163/156854005775197325								WOS:000234239600001

Cyclops spp. generally develop and grow during favourable food conditions in spring and undergo a diapause in summer, while Acanthocyclops robustus, Mesocyclops leuckarti and Thermocyclops crassus develop and grow in summer when they face poorer food conditions and more competition from Cladocera. Since nauplii are the bottleneck in copepod development, we tested the hypothesis that Cyclops abyssorum and C. vicinus nauplii have higher food requirements for survival and development than the nauplii of A. robustus, M. leuckarti and T. crassus. We also tested survivorship and development from hatching to adulthood. 2. Survivorship and development of the copepods was studied in a flow-through system using five concentrations of the phytoflagellate Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in the range from 1 x 10(4) to 4.5 x 10(5) cells mL(-1) (approximately 0.5-22.5 mg C L-1). 3. Nauplii of both species of Cyclops died at intermediate to low (C. abyssorum) and low (C. vicinus) food concentrations, while nauplii of A. robustus, M. leuckarti and T. crassus survived at all concentrations. 4. The negative effects of low food concentration were also reflected in development. In C. abyssorum and C. vicinus, development duration increased at low food concentration while development was much less affected in A. robustus and T. crassus. Mesocyclops leuckarti was intermediate between Cyclops spp. and A. robustus/T. crassus, with an increase in development duration at the lowest food concentration. 5. Our results support the hypothesis that summer diapause in Cyclops spp. has developed as a strategy to avoid a food bottleneck for nauplii.																	0046-5070					SEP	2005	50	9					1454	1463		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2005.01417.x								WOS:000231224500002

Animals were subjected to the outdoor conditions of a desert environment. Blood samples were taken at regular intervals of about 3 hr (added to particular samples at 1 hr before then 30 min and 1 hr after sunset, and 1 hr before and 1 hr after sunrise) for 24 hr at both solstices and equinoxes of the year. The plasma melatonin levels steeply increased soon after sunset and remained elevated throughout all the night. Then, melatonin concentrations progressively declined shortly before sunrise and returned to daytime basal levels 1 hr later. There was no seasonal variation in the amplitude or in the offset of the melatonin peak or in the daytime basal levels. The onset of the nocturnal peak was delayed by 2 hr in June at the summer solstice (P < 0.05), which can be related to the changes in night length between the two solstices. A significant effect of age was observed in all seasons. Melatonin levels were higher in the young camel group (fall equinox: P < 0.001; spring equinox: P < 0.01; winter solstice: P < 0.01; summer solstice: P < 0.05). The pattern of melatonin secretion in the camel showed a significant seasonal variation parallel to the photoperiodic changes of the year. The observed decline of melatonin levels during an extra-light pulse in the middle of the night indicates the light control of melatonin synthesis. It is not yet known if, in this low latitude desert region, the seasonal breeding period of the camel is cued by the photoperiod. The data obtained, however, clearly demonstrate that the camel has the capacity to follow and to integrate photoperiodic changes through melatonin changes.																	0742-3098	1600-079X				SEP	2005	39	2					121	128		10.1111/j.1600-079X.2005.00224.x								WOS:000230888700004	16098088

Fecal testosterone was analyzed by radioimmunoassay in samples collected from male Sun bears (n = 8) housed in zoological parks in North America and New Zealand, over periods of < 27 months. Testosterone levels were often, but not exclusively, elevated during mating periods with peaks accompanying breeding behavior and copulation. There was a significant effect of age with older bears having clearly higher concentrations of fecal testosterone (P < 0.001). Testosterone concentrations fluctuated throughout the year, with no significant effect of season (P > 0.05). All bears did, however, share a common pattern of annual excretion that suggests a potential role for non-photoperiodic seasonal influences on testicular cycles. Levels were generally lower early in the year with regular increases occurring at 3-4-month intervals. Grouped data suggest an association between cycles of testosterone production in males and months of peak reproductive activity in captivity.

Body size, development and prey traits	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY					9th International Symposium on Ecology of Aphidophaga	SEP, 2004	Ceske Budejovice, CZECH REPUBLIC	Acad Sci, Inst Entomol, Univ S Bohemia, Biol Fac				Interactions between syrphid predators and their prey are poorly known. The adaptations of syrphids to aphid defences and the consequences for the evolution of life history traits in these predators especially are mostly unstudied. This is the first of two papers investigating the evolution of prey specialization in aphidophagous hoverflies. The study focuses on two questions: (1) Are differences in the body size of syrphid predators reflected in differences in the size of their prey? (2) Are differences in body size, body mass and development time of the syrphid predators correlated with the defence strategies of their aphid prey (e.g. mobility, toxicity)? Platycheirus clypeatus (Meigen, 1822), Platycheirus fulviventris (Macquart, 1829), Melanostoma mellinum (Linnaeus, 1758), and Melanostoma scalare (Fabricius, 1794), which differ considerably in their prey specialization, but are closely related, were chosen as model species. Life history data for these syrphids came from a laboratory study, and that for the aphids from a literature survey. These syrphid species can be arranged on a gradient of increasing prey specialization, from 32 prey species for the generalist M mellinum and only 3 for the specialist P. fulviventris. Differences in prey specialization were even more evident when the defence ability of the various species of aphid prey was considered. For instance, the specialization on ant-attended aphids in M scalare. Larvae exhibited a one or two weeks diapause which made the determination of developmental time imprecise. Body size of the predators was not reflected in that of their aphid prey. The postulated relationship between body size of the predator and the defence strategies of their prey was not supported by our data. A comparison of a wider range of syrphid species from different taxonomic groupings together with a phylogenetic correction procedure might reveal clearer trends. The second part of this paper (Dziock, in prep.) will investigate the correlation between prey specialization and reproductive strategies (i.e. clutch size, egg size and number) and will put the results into a broader framework.																	1802-8829					AUG 15	2005	102	3					413	421		10.14411/eje.2005.059								WOS:000231353100012						
J	Trayhurn, P				Trayhurn, P			Endocrine and signalling role of adipose tissue: new perspectives on fat	ACTA PHYSIOLOGICA SCANDINAVICA					11th International Symposium on Thermogenesis and Uncoupling Proteins	NOV   08, 2004	Oulu, FINLAND	Scandinavian Physiol Soc				White adipose tissue (WAT) is now recognized as a major endocrine and secretory organ, releasing a wide range of protein factors and signals termed adipokines - in addition to fatty acids and other lipid moieties. A paradigm shift came with the discovery of leptin, a pleiotropic hormone which is a critical signal to the hypothalamus in the control of appetite and energy balance. A number of adipokines, including adiponectin, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, macrophage migration inhibitory factor, nerve growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and haptoglobin, are linked to inflammation and the inflammatory response. Obesity is characterized by a state of mild inflammation, and the expression and release of inflammation-related adipokines generally rises as adipose tissue expands; a notable exception is adiponectin, with its anti-inflammatory action, the levels of which fall. WAT may be the main site of inflammation in obesity, increased circulating levels of inflammatory markers reflecting spillover from an 'inflamed' tissue, leading to the obesity-associated pathologies of type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. From the wide range of adipokines now identified, it is evident that WAT is highly integrated into overall physiological regulation, involving extensive crosstalk with other organs and multiple metabolic systems. Whether major changes in adipokine production in obesity, particularly of those factors linked to inflammation, are unique to this condition, or are a feature of all situations in which there are substantial increases in adipose mass (such as pregnancy, and pre-hibernatory and pre-migratory fattening) requires consideration.				e-, a/F-9947-2012													0001-6772					AUG	2005	184	4					285	293		10.1111/j.1365-201X.2005.01468.x								WOS:000230891200004	16026420					
J	Schnitzer, SA				Schnitzer, SA			A mechanistic explanation for global patterns of liana abundance and distribution	AMERICAN NATURALIST												One of the main goals in ecology is determining the mechanisms that control the abundance and distribution of organisms. Using data from 69 tropical forests worldwide, I demonstrate that liana (woody vine) abundance is correlated negatively with mean annual precipitation and positively with seasonality, a pattern precisely the opposite of most other plant types. I propose a general mechanistic hypothesis integrating both ecological and ecophysiological approaches to explain this pattern. Specifically, the deep root and efficient vascular systems of lianas enable them to suffer less water stress during seasonal droughts while many competitors are dormant, giving lianas a competitive advantage during the dry season. Testing this hypothesis in central Panama, I found that lianas grew approximately seven times more in height than did trees during the dry season but only twice as much during the wet season. Over time, this dry season advantage may allow lianas to increase in abundance in seasonal forests. In aseasonal wet forests, however, lianas gain no such advantage because competing plants are rarely limited by water. I extend this theory to account for the local, within-forest increase in liana abundance in response to disturbance as well as the conspicuous decrease in liana abundance at high latitudes.

J	Harada, T; Nitta, S; Ito, K				Harada, T; Nitta, S; Ito, K			Photoperiodic changes according to global warming in wing-form determination and diapause induction of a water strider, Aquarius paludum (Heteroptera : Gerridae)	APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY												In the 1991-strain of Aquarius paludum in Kochi, both critical photoperiods for wing-form and diapause shifted to longer values by I h when specimens were grown under gradually decreasing photoperiods. However, the 1999-strain didn't respond at all to decreasing (14.5L to 13.5L) or increasing (12.5L to 13.5L) photoperiods. Photoperiodic response for wing-form determination by the 2002-strain was witnessed only in a small range between 60% and 95% as the proportion of long-winged form, and the critical photoperiod (14L) was a little bit longer than the critical value of 13.75L for the 1991-strain. The critical photoperiod for diapause induction in the 2002-strain was estimated to be 13.5L-10.513 under a constant photoperiod, which was one-half hour longer than that of the 13L-11D shown by the 1991-strain. In August and September in Kochi, the critical day lengths for wing-form determination and diapause induction of the 1999-2002-strains remain to be 14L-10D and 13.5L-10.5D, respectively, even under decreasing day-length. Therefore, the two critical values were "shorter" than those of "15L-9D" and "14L-10D" of the 1991-strain. The annual average temperature (17.1 +/- 0.5 degrees C) and annual average high and low temperatures (35.6 +/- 1.3, -3.1 +/- 0.9) in 1991-2000 were higher than those (16.4 +/- 0.5, 34.9 +/- 1.1, -4.4 +/- 1.4) a decade ago (1981-1990). In Kochi, the global warming in the last two decades may have caused A. paludum to select "shorter" critical photoperiods for the currently dominant strain (1999-2002-strain) in terms of wing-form determination and diapause induction under decreasing day-length in August to October (14.8 h to 11.5 h) in compared to the former strain (1991-strain) dominant a decade ago. This "shorter" critical photoperiod leads to a longer active fall season for reproduction and larval growth of A. paludum.																	0003-6862					AUG	2005	40	3					461	466		10.1303/aez.2005.461								WOS:000232563000011

The lower threshold temperature for development and the thermal constant among one generation did not differ largely according to the diets. There were two variations in the larval instar numbers, those being the six- or seven-instar type. The incidence of the seven-instar type fed the artificial diet was significantly lower than those fed on the host plants. The pupal weight for the six-instar type was significantly heavier for those fed the artificial diet than those fed on the host plants. Seasonal host plant effects were detected in some developmental traits. The critical photoperiods for diapause induction at 20 and 25 degrees C were similar between the host plants, and were shorter with the artificial diet than with the host plants. The present results suggest that the data for the artificial diet need not be modified in the parameters for the developmental rate, but that the critical photoperiod for diapause induction needs to be slightly lengthened when the data are applied to field insects.																	0003-6862					AUG	2005	40	3					475	482		10.1303/aez.2005.475								WOS:000232563000013						
J	Lewis, TL; Esler, D; Boyd, WS; Zydelis, R				Lewis, TL; Esler, D; Boyd, WS; Zydelis, R			Nocturnal foraging behavior of wintering surf scoters and White-winged Scoters	CONDOR												We studied the nocturnal foraging behavior of Surf Scoters (Melanitta perspicillata) and White-winged Scoters (Melanitta fusca) during winter in coastal British Columbia, Canada. Using radio telemetry, we collected nocturnal and diurnal data documenting the frequency of foraging dives and the location of scoters in relation to their intertidal foraging grounds. We found that dive foraging rarely occurred during nocturnal periods for either species. Only 2% of nocturnal observation blocks for both scoter species contained diving, compared with 98% of diurnal observation blocks. This corresponded to an average of only 0.1 min spent underwater per half-hour observation block during the night and over 7 min during the day. Both species of scoters were located farther offshore and in deeper waters during nocturnal hours, indicating that they were not using intertidal foraging areas at night. Our results suggest that Surf Scoters and White-winged Scoters face daylight-imposed limits on the amount of available foraging time. These potential day-length restrictions should be considered when reviewing human activities that potentially alter the amount of available foraging time or food supplies in winter habitats.

J	Cooper, CB; Hochachka, WM; Butcher, G; Dhondt, AA				Cooper, CB; Hochachka, WM; Butcher, G; Dhondt, AA			Seasonal and latitudinal trends in clutch size: Thermal constraints during laying and incubation	ECOLOGY												Explaining patterns of latitudinal and seasonal trends in clutch size are two of the oldest and most fundamental endeavors in avian life history research. Underlying the majority of studies regarding any type of clutch size variation (i.e., individual, seasonal, latitudinal) of altricial birds is the premise that the primary cost of reproduction stems from feeding offspring. However, both altricial and precocial species of birds display latitudinal and seasonal variation in clutch size. Additionally, individual variation in costs of laying and incubation, recently demonstrated, indicates that understanding latitudinal and seasonal clutch size trends will require increased attention to earlier phases of reproduction. Given the strength and ubiquity of the clutch size patterns, many environmental factors, such as food supply and predation, have been proposed to account for the patterns, but temperature has been largely overlooked. Gradients in many variables may be important because the primacy of selection pressures may also vary in space and time. Furthermore, physiological systems may constrain responses to selection pressures. Thus, it is possible that intraspecific geographic and seasonal patterns in clutch size are at least partially influenced by temperature-dependent physiological processes. Therefore, we suggest that it is important to examine physiological responses of birds (e.g., embryo development, incubation energetics) directly influenced by physical properties of the environment, which exhibit predictable types of spatial and temporal variation (e.g., temperature, humidity, day length). We review two recently proposed, complementary hypotheses that are excellent candidates for this approach. By one mechanism, the thermal inertia of large clutches makes them favorable in cooler weather (the clutch-cooling hypothesis of J.M. Reid et al.). By the other, the reduction in egg viability under warm temperatures favors small clutches (the egg-viability hypothesis of S. H. Stoleson and S. R. Beissinger). Using general linear mixed models, we found that large-scale nesting patterns of Eastern Bluebirds and Red-winged Blackbirds are consistent with the egg-viability hypothesis in that females appear to initiate incubation before clutch completion when they lay large clutches at low latitudes. Although attempts have been made to overcome the logistical obstacles associated with studying large-scale phenomena through meta-analyses and multiple small-scale study sites, we demonstrate the significant potential of new technologies combined with volunteer-based studies to validate these hypotheses as we outline directions for future research.

Estimates were made using ground-based UV-B data (Brewer spectrophotometers), solar radiation models, GIS tools, field characterization of vegetative features, and quantification of DOC concentration and spectral absorbance. UV-B dose estimates were made for the summer solstice, at a depth of 1 cm in each wetland. The mean dose across all wetlands and parks was 19.3 W-h m(-2) (range of 3.4-32.1 W-h m(-2)). The mean dose was lowest in Acadia (13.7 W-h m(-2)) and highest in Rocky (24.4 W-h m(-2)). Doses were significantly different among all parks. These wetland doses correspond to UV-B flux of 125.0 mu W cm(-2) (range 21.4-194.7 mu W cm(-2)) based on a day length, averaged among all parks, of 15.5 h. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC), a key determinant of water-column UV-B flux, ranged from 0.6 (analytical detection limit) to 36.7 mg C L-1 over all wetlands and parks, and reduced potential maximal UV-B doses at 1-cm depth by 1%-87%. DOC concentration, as well as its effect on dose, was lowest in Sequoia and highest in Acadia (DOC was equivalent in Acadia, Glacier, and Rocky). Landscape reduction of potential maximal UV-B doses ranged from zero to 77% and was lowest in Sequoia. These regional differences in UV-B wetland dose illustrate the importance of considering all aspects of exposure in evaluating the potential impact of UV-B on aquatic organisms.

Diapause expression is highly variable within and among natural populations and has significant effects on life-history profiles, including patterns of longevity, fecundity, and stress resistance. We hypothesized that if diapause expression is associated with overwintering mechanisms and adaptation to temperate environments, the frequency of diapause incidence would exhibit a latitudinal cline among natural populations. Because stress resistance and reproductive traits are also clinal in this species, we also examined how patterns of fecundity and longevity varied with geography and how stress resistance and associated traits differed constitutively between diapause and nondiapause lines. Diapause incidence was shown to vary predictably with latitude, ranging from 35% to 90% among natural populations in the eastern United States Survivorship under starvation stress differed between diapause and nondiapause lines; diapause phenotypes were also distinct for total body triglyceride content and the developmental distribution of oocytes in the ovary following stress exposure. Patterns of longevity, fecundity, and ovariole number also varied with geography. The data suggest that, for North American populations, diapause expression is functionally associated with overwintering mechanisms and may be an integral life-history component in natural populations.

At or above this immersion period and temperature, there was no difference in mealybug stage mortality. We evaluated a commercial operation, which used a 5-min immersion in each of three water tanks: preheating (30.0 +/- 3 degrees C), hot-water (52.8 +/- 0.3 degrees C), and cooling (23 +/- 3 degrees C).

J	Moore, IT; Bonier, F; Wingfield, JC				Moore, IT; Bonier, F; Wingfield, JC			Reproductive asynchrony and population divergence between two tropical bird populations	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY												High-latitude vertebrates generally breed seasonally and synchronously as the primary environmental cue used to time seasonal processes is photoperiod. Investigations of tropical vertebrates have also documented seasonal reproduction, but it is unclear how synchronous reproduction is, both within and between populations. In this study, we investigated whether seasonal reproduction in a tropical species is synchronous between two populations in close proximity and, if not, whether asynchrony is correlated with genetic and cultural differentiation. We describe two equatorial populations of rufous-collared sparrows (Zonotrichia capensis), at the same latitude and separated by 25 km, that each breed seasonally but out of phase with each other. This asynchronous reproductive phenology is associated with local weather patterns and is independent of photoperiod. At a finer scale, reproductive timing is more highly synchronized within monogamous pairs than within the population as a whole. Associated with the difference in reproductive phenologies, we document that males in each population sing different song dialects. Using microsatellite DNA analysis, we found limited gene flow and significant genetic differentiation between the two populations. From these results we hypothesize that Cultural and genetic differentiation between populations, which can be greater in tropical populations than temperate ones, can be associated with locally adapted reproductive phenologies.

The separation of two hymenopteran parasitoids, Tersilochus obscurator and Tersilochus microgaster (Ichneumonidae), of stem-mining pests of winter oilseed rape using DNA, morphometric and ecological data	BULLETIN OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH												Tersilochus obscurator Aubert and Tersilochus microgaster (Szepligeti) are larval endoparasitoids of economically-important stem-mining pests of winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) in Europe. They are difficult to separate morphologically. Their hosts are Ceutorhynchus pallidactylus (Marsham) and Psylliodes chrysocephala Linnaeus, respectively. The parasitoids' taxonomic status, identification, host range and phenology were studied using genetic, morphometric and ecological data. The study used 527 female parasitoids from the UK and Germany, either field-collected in emergence traps or reared from field-collected host larvae. Two morphometric characters, the ovipositor sheath to first metasomal tergite ratio and the percentage of the mesopleuron spanned by the sternaulus, were measured. A 440 bp section of mitochondrial DNA cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene was sequenced from 35 parasitoids reared from C. pallidactylus, 20 reared from P. chrysocephala and individuals from two outgroups, Tersilochus heterocerus Thomson and Phradis interstitialis Thomson. Distinct and invariable COI sequences corresponded exclusively to each parasitoid group, confirming that T. obscurator and T. microgaster are discrete species. Measurements of host-reared and COI-sequenced specimens indicated that the ranges of both morphometric characters overlapped between species. Using these ranges as criteria, all but 3.6% of UK specimens and 2% of German specimens were identifiable to species without reference to host or phenology. There were differences in emergence phenology in the UK, adult T. microgaster emerging from winter diapause by 29 March 2000, T. obscurator emerging between 12 April and 24 May 2000. The value of molecular techniques in the identification of closely-related parasitoid species is discussed.

Natural loss-of-function mutations in FRI cause the early flowering growth habits of many A. thaliana accessions. To quantify the variation among wild accessions due to FRI, and to identify additional genetic loci in wild accessions that influence flowering time, we surveyed the flowering times of 145 accessions in long-day photoperiods, with and without a 30-day vernalization treatment, and genotyped them for two common natural lesions in FRI. FRI is disrupted in at least 84 of the accessions, accounting for only similar to 40 % of the flowering-time variation in long days. During efforts to dissect the causes for variation that are independent of known dysfunctional FRI alleles, we found new loss-of-function alleles in FLC, as well as late-flowering alleles that do not map to FRI or FLC. An FLC nonsense mutation was found in the early flowering Van-0 accession, which has otherwise functional FRI. In contrast, Lz-0 flowers late because of high levels of FLC expression, even though it has a deletion in FRI. Finally, eXtreme array mapping identified genomic regions linked to the vernalization-independent, late-flowering habit of Bur-0, which has an alternatively spliced FLC allele that behaves as a null allele.

The two forms are different morphologically as well as biologically. The summer form is of light colour and readily mates and starts egg laying 1-2 days after emergence, whereas, the winter form is larger, generally darker and in reproductive diapause. The first form is observed under long photoperiod, while the second form is induced under a combination of short photoperiod and low temperature. The combination of long photoperiod and warm temperature enhanced post-emergence ovarian development in the winter form, showing a close inverse correlation between pre-oviposition period and increasing temperatures. Both forms of A. pistaciae are adapted to a wide temperature range of 20-30 degrees C for reproduction, and the fecundity of psyllid adults of either summer- or winter forms was found to be very high under experimental conditions.																	0931-2048					JUL	2005	129	6					342	346		10.1111/j.1439-0418.2005.00974.342-346								WOS:000230432300010

When exposed to increasing photoperiods (hours of light: hours of darkness; 11.5L:12.5D, 12L:12D, 12.5L:11.5D, 13L:11D, 14L:10D, and 18L:6D) for 9-12 weeks, buntings responded in a photoperiod-dependent manner and underwent growth and regression cycle under photoperiods of >= 12 hr per day. Also, the response to a long photoperiod of birds that were held under natural photoperiods at 27 degrees N for 2 years was similar to those who arrived the same year from their breeding grounds (similar to 40 N), suggesting that the experience of higher amplitude day-night (light-dark, LD) cycles during migratory and breeding seasons were not critical for the subsequent response (initiation-termination-reinitiation) cycle. Another experiment examined entrainment of the circadian photoperiodic rhythm in buntings by subjecting them to T = 24 +/- 2 hr LD-cycles with 8 hr photophase and to T = 22 and 24 hr with 11 hr photophase. The results showed a reduction in critical day length under T = 22 hr LD-cycle. In the last experiment, we constructed an action spectrum for photoperiodic induction by exposing birds for 4.5 weeks to 13L: 1 ID of white (control), blue (450 nm), or red (640 nm) light at irradiances ranging from 0.028 to 1.4 Wm(-2). The threshold light irradiance for photoinduction was about 10-fold higher for blue light, than for red and white lights. These results conclude that the daily light of the environment regulates the endogenous program that times seasonal responses in body fattening and testicular cycles of the redheaded bunting.

Central European C. c. aquaticus was genetically more diverse than the other subspecies (although not significantly so, due to small sample sizes), whereas our sample of the nominate subspecies from the French Pyrenees showed no haplotype variation. Pairwise comparisons of the four subspecies showed significant genetic differentiation between the taxa except for a lack of differentiation of C. c. hibernicus versus C. c. aquaticus and C. c. cinclus.

J	Tracy, CR; Diamond, J				Tracy, CR; Diamond, J			Regulation of gut function varies with life-history traits in chuckwallas (Sauromalus obesus : Iguanidae)	PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL ZOOLOGY												We examined the effects of hibernation and fasting on intestinal glucose and proline uptake rates of chuckwallas (Sauromalus obesus) and on the size of organs directly or indirectly related to digestion. These lizards show geographic variation in body size and growth rate that parallels an elevational gradient in our study area. At low elevation, food is available only for a short time during the spring; at high elevation, food may also be available during summer and autumn, depending on rainfall conditions in a given year. We hypothesized that low-elevation lizards with a short season of food availability would show more pronounced regulation of gut size and function than high-elevation lizards with prolonged or bimodal food availability. Hibernating lizards from both elevations had significantly lower uptake rates per milligram intestine for both nutrients, and lower small intestine mass, than active lizards. The combination of these two effects resulted in significantly lower total nutrient uptake in hibernating animals compared to active ones. The stomach, large intestine, and cecum showed lower masses in hibernators, but these results were not statistically significant. The heart, kidney, and liver showed no difference in mass between hibernating and nonhibernating animals. Lizards from low elevations with a short growing season also showed a greater increase in both uptake rates and small intestine mass from the hibernating to the active state, compared to those from high elevations with longer growing seasons. Thus, compared to those from long growing season areas, lizards from short growing season areas have equal uptake capacity during hibernation but much higher uptake capacity while active and feeding. This pattern of regulation of gut function may or may not be an adaptive response, but it is consistent with variation in life-history characteristics among populations. In areas with a short season, those lizards that can extract nutrients quickly and then reduce the gut will be favored; in areas where food may be available later in the year, those lizards that maintain an active gut would be favored. While other researchers have found much greater magnitudes of gut regulation when making comparisons among species, we find the different patterns of change in gut function between different populations of chuckwallas particularly intriguing because they occur within a single species.

Much of the difference in vernalization response is apparently due to variation at two epistatically acting loci, FRI and FLC. We present the response of over 150 wild accessions to three different environmental variables. In long days, FLC is among those genes whose expression is most highly correlated with flowering. In short days, FRI and FLC are less important, although their contribution is still significant. In addition, there is considerable variation not only in vernalization response, but also in the response to differences in day length or ambient growth temperature. The identification of accessions that flower relatively early or late in specific environments suggests that many of the flowering-time pathways identified by mutagenesis, such as those that respond to day length, contribute to flowering-time variation in the wild. In contrast to differences in vernalization requirement, which are mainly mediated by FRI and FLC, it seems that variation in these other pathways is due to allelic effects at several different loci.

JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY												Earlier experiments demonstrated a strong up-regulation of per mRNA in wild-type (Wt) females of Pyrrhocoris apterus reared under diapause-inducing short days, while per mRNA levels were low in females of two non-diapause mutant strains (Nd), irrespective of photoperiod. In the present study, different sequences of per DNA in two strains of geographically different origin enabled us to analyse genetic linkage between the per gene and the Nd phenotype. Crosses between Wt females originating from C. Budejovice (Czech Republic) and Nd males originating from Lyon (France) resulted in F-2 progeny where 411 females entered diapause under short days and 120 females were reproducing. Thus, the segregation was very close to the 3:1 ratio in favour of diapause females, suggesting that the Nd trait behaves as a single autosomal recessive. Analysis of DNA in 20 females of the F-2 progeny revealed that their phenotype was not linked to the per genotype. We conclude that the per gene is not primarily responsible for the block to diapause photoresponsiveness in Nd mutants and its role, if any, is downstream from other gene(s) controlling diapause. This is the first attempt at genetic linkage analysis between a bona fide circadian clock gene and photoperiodism in a `nondrosophilid' species. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The temporal pattern of timeless expression differed between the two diapausing instars and was significantly higher in southern (38-40 degrees N) than in northern (50 degrees N) populations, when diapausing instar was held constant. Expression of timeless is therefore both developmentally and evolutionarily variable. This result provides the first example of a latitudinal difference in the expression of timeless, suggesting that, along with evidence from other insects, timeless has the potential to affect photoperiodic response and its adaptive evolution in temperate seasonal environments.

J	Higaki, M; Ando, Y				Higaki, M; Ando, Y			Effects of temperature during chilling and pre-chilling periods on diapause and post-diapause development in a katydid, Eobiana engelhardti subtropica	JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY												In Eobiana engelhardti subtropica, early laid eggs reach the diapause stage in early autumn. For long periods before winter, the eggs are exposed to temperatures higher than their theoretical lower threshold for development. In contrast, late-laid eggs cannot reach their diapause stage before winter. Our study showed that E. e. subtropica copes with these difficulties via the thermal response involving embryonic diapause. In this katydid, the almost fully developed embryo undergoes an obligatory diapause. When diapause eggs were maintained at a temperature of 20 degrees C or higher, diapause persisted for a long time. Diapause was effectively terminated by temperatures ranging from 1 to 11 degrees C, and hatching occurred successfully at temperatures from 11 to 15 degrees C. In addition to the chilling temperature, pre-chilling temperature modified diapause intensity and hatching time. Diapause eggs hatched earlier after chilling when the pre-chilling temperature was lower, within a range of 14.5-25 degrees C. Thus, the low-temperature requirement for diapause termination prevents early laid eggs from untimely hatching in autumn, and low temperatures before and during winter decrease diapause intensity and shorten the hatching time in the following spring. When eggs were chilled before diapause, they tolerated chilling and averted diapause. Thus, even if eggs encounter low temperatures before diapause, they can hatch in the following spring.

In this species diapause eggs pass the summer in the cadavers of adult female mites. Adult female mites were collected for several weeks from pastures in spring at 18 sites in south-western Australia and dissected to determine the timing of the production of diapause eggs. Some sites were sampled for several years between 1990 and 1997. A model was developed to predict the time for onset of diapause. The week at which 90% of eggs were in diapause was predicted best by daylength (80.1% of the variability), then by duration of the long-term plant growing season (10.4%, of variability), leaving 9.5% due to other factors. A single chemical spray in spring 2 weeks before the production of 90% diapause eggs resulted in 99% fewer mites present in autumn 7-8 months later at three sites. The timing of the spring spray was the factor leading to successful control. This model was tested at 17 sites across the whole geographical distribution of the redlegged earth mite in Australia between 1998 and 2001. The observed week of 90% diapause was within 1 week of the predicted week on 81% of occasions, and 2 weeks earlier on 15% of occasions. A database was created for the predicted date of onset of 90% diapause for the whole distribution of the redlegged earth mite in southern Australia on a 10 km(2) grid. Australian farmers are using this for timing a spring spray to control mites in the following autumn. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

One sea skater species, Halobates sericeus, was collected at 18 locations in the East China Sea area (27 degrees 10'N-33 degrees 24'N, 124 degrees 57'E-129 degrees 30'E), and H. micans and/or H. germanus at only 8 locations in the area south of 29 degrees 47'N, where water temperatures were more than 25 degrees C. At three locations, where the water temperature was less than 23 degrees C, neither H. micans nor H. germanus were caught. The effect of photoperiod on the aggregation and mating behaviour of the sea skater, H. sericeus, was studied under laboratory conditions during a one-month cruise. Adults and 5(th) instar larvae of H. sericeus, collected between 29 degrees 02'N and 30 degrees 29'N, were kept under long (14.5L : 9.5D) or short-day (10.5L : 13.5D) conditions at 23 +/- 2 degrees C for 20 days. Aggregation and mating behaviour of these sea skaters were recorded over a period of 150 min during the daytime. To analyze the data, the observation period of 150 min was divided into 50 intervals of 3 min. Aggregation was observed more under short than long-days. Duration of a group was much longer under the short (mean +/- SD : 43.0 +/- 108.1 see) than long-days (7.6 +/- 3.1 sec).																	1210-5759					MAY 3	2005	102	2					299	302		10.14411/eje.2005.043								WOS:000229497100022

However, genetic variation aiding the sympatric radiation of the group in the United States may have geographic roots. Inversions on chromosomes 1-3 affecting diapause traits adapting flies to differences in host fruiting phenology appear to exist in the United States because of a series of secondary introgression events from Mexico. Here, we investigate whether these inverted regions of the genome may have subsequently evolved to become more recalcitrant to introgression relative to collinear regions, consistent with new models for chromosomal speciation. As predicted by the models, gene trees for six nuclear loci mapping to chromosomes other than 1-3 tended to have shallower node depths separating Mexican and U.S. haplotypes relative to an outgroup sequence than nine genes residing on chromosomes 1-3. We discuss the implications of secondary contact and differential introgression with respect to sympatric host race formation and speciation in Rhagoletis, reconciling some of the seemingly dichotomous views of Mayr, Dobzhansky, and Bush concerning modes of divergence.

The durations of the larval and pupal stages decreased in the range from 15 to 28 degrees C, but the developmental periods were longer at 30 degrees C than at 28 degrees C. The developmental zero and the thermal constants were calculated to be 9.8 degrees C and 104.1 degree-days for eggs, 9.3 degrees C and 232.6 degree-days for larvae, 11.5 degrees C and 76.3 degree-days for pupae, and 10.3 degrees C and 417.0 degree-days from egg to adult emergence. The temperature significantly affected the number of eggs deposited by a single female, the proportion of eggs hatched, and the longevity of adult females. At both 15 and 20 degrees C, larval and pupal developmental periods were significantly shorter for the long-day length of 16L:8D than for the short-day length of 10L:14D.

Attitude and host plant use also differed among them. For the temperate populations of Mire, Kashihara, Fuchu, Yokosuka and Yamagata, the critical photoperiod increased with latitude, and the subtropical Ishigaki population showed the shortest critical photoperiod. Further, a change in the shape of photoperiodic response curve, but no shift in the critical photoperiod, was found in a mountain population of Kiire, giving a high incidence of diapause in long photoperiods. These results are discussed in relation to latitude, altitude, and host plant.																	0003-6862					MAY	2005	40	2					347	350		10.1303/aez.2005.347								WOS:000230665700018						
J	Heide, OM				Heide, OM			Ecotypic variation among European arctic and alpine populations of Oxyda digyna	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Morphological and physiological variation of four geographically separated European populations of Oxyria digyna (L.) Hill (Polygonaceae) ranging from 45 to 78 degrees N latitude were studied in controlled environments. Characters such as the presence of rhizomes, variable stamen number, few inflorescence branches, and low leaf length/width ratio were found to be common to northern populations. Perennating buds were formed under short day (SD) conditions in all populations across the temperature range (9-21 degrees C), while induction of dormancy required the combination of SD and low temperature. Dormancy release of dormant buds required long day (LD) conditions only. The species was found to be a short-long-day plant for flowering control, the SD requirement being quantitative while the subsequent LD requirement is obligatory. Both the SD flowering response and the fecundity of flowering decreased clinally with increasing latitude of population origin, while the critical daylength for secondary floral induction showed a parallel increase. With some minor modifications, these results agree with earlier findings with North American populations. It is concluded that the obligatory LD requirement for flowering has been a limiting factor for the southward geographic distribution of the species, and that the photoperiodic control of flowering and winter dormancy renders Oxyria particularly well adapted to resist potential negative effects of rising global temperature.																	1523-0430					MAY	2005	37	2					233	238		10.1657/1523-0430(2005)037[0233:EVAEAA]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000229484200011						
J	Wearing, CH; Harris, AC				Wearing, CH; Harris, AC			Evaluation of the predatory wasp, Ancistrocerus gazella, for biological control of leafrollers in Otago fruit crops. II. Wasp phenology and seasonal changes in prey composition	BIOCONTROL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The phenology of the predatory wasp, Ancistrocerus gazella ( Panzer), colonising artificial nests was studied over 3 years in seven Study Areas in or adjacent to mixed pome and stonefruit orchards in Otago, New Zealand. Each Study Area had three to four nest sites comprising groups of wooden blocks drilled with 6 mm diameter nest tubes 75 - 150 mm in length. The timing of nest tube colonisation was recorded by observing the presence of nest closures ( mud plugs) and their subsequent opening during adult emergence. The nest tubes from some entire nest sites were dissected to determine the stages of development of the wasps and their subsequent emergence, and samples of nest tubes were dissected weekly from a range of nest sites to determine changes in prey composition over the season. A. gazella was found to be primarily bivoltine, but part of each generation entered diapause and a small number of second generation wasps also emerged before winter in warm sites. The adult foraging of each generation was well synchronised with late larval instars of the two generations of three pest leafroller species. However, very low numbers of leafroller larvae were collected because A. gazella was highly polyphagous, predominantly exploiting a sequence of other lepidopterous species. It was concluded that management of A. gazella for leafroller control would be uneconomic but it provides a useful component of the natural enemy complex of pest leafroller species.																	0958-3157					MAY	2005	15	3					281	298		10.1080/09583150400016993								WOS:000229552400006

The mean time in (days) for the different stages of its cycle was as follows: incubation period of eggs was 15.3 days; prefeeding, feeding and premoulting periods of larvae and nymphs averaged 5.5, 4.0 and 7.3 days, and 5.2, 5.0 and 14.6 days, respectively; prefeeding, feeding, preoviposition and oviposition periods of female adults lasted for 7.8, 4.5, 4.3 and 14.0 days, respectively. There existed a highly significant correlation between engorged body weight of females and egg masses laid (r=0.9877, p < 0.001). The reproductive efficiency index (REI) and reproductive fitness index (RFI) in females were 11.09 and 9.58, respectively. No relationship between nymphal engorged body weight and resultant sexes was observed. Delayed feeding and non-oviposition (in June and July) existed in females, and low temperature (-10 degrees C) treatment for 45 days could terminate oviposition diapause. However, the egg masses laid by post-diapause females were significantly smaller than those laid by females engorged in March, April and May.																	0168-8162					MAY	2005	36	1-2					131	138		10.1007/s10493-005-1271-1								WOS:000229895600012	16082930

J	Hulden, L; Hulden, L; Heliovaara, K				Hulden, L; Hulden, L; Heliovaara, K			Endemic malaria: an 'indoor' disease in northern Europe. Historical data analysed	MALARIA JOURNAL												Background: Endemic northern malaria reached 68 degrees N latitude in Europe during the 19(th) century, where the summer mean temperature only irregularly exceeded 16 degrees C, the lower limit needed for sporogony of Plasmodium vivax. Because of the available historical material and little use of quinine, Finland was suitable for an analysis of endemic malaria and temperature. Methods: Annual malaria death frequencies during 1800 - 1870 extracted from parish records were analysed against long- term temperature records in Finland, Russia and Sweden. Supporting data from 1750 - 1799 were used in the interpretation of the results. The life cycle and behaviour of the anopheline mosquitoes were interpreted according to the literature. Results: Malaria frequencies correlated strongly with the mean temperature of June and July of the preceding summer, corresponding to larval development of the vector. Hatching of imagoes peaks in the middle of August, when the temperature most years is too low for the sporogony of Plasmodium. After mating some of the females hibernate in human dwellings. If the female gets gametocytes from infective humans, the development of Plasmodium can only continue indoors, in heated buildings. Conclusion: Northern malaria existed in a cold climate by means of summer dormancy of hypnozoites in humans and indoor transmission of sporozoites throughout the winter by semiactive hibernating mosquitoes. Variable climatic conditions did not affect this relationship. The epidemics, however, were regulated by the population size of the mosquitoes which, in turn, ultimately was controlled by the temperatures of the preceding summer.																	1475-2875					APR 25	2005	4								19	10.1186/1475-2875-4-19								WOS:000228925600001	15847704					
J	Benson, AM; Winker, K				Benson, AM; Winker, K			Fat-deposition strategies among high-latitude passerine migrants	AUK												We studied fat stores in passerine migrants at a high-latitude site in Fairbanks, Alaska (64 degrees 50 ' N, 147 degrees 50 ' W). We examined fat-deposition strategies during the final (spring) and initial (autumn) stages of long-distance migration, 1992-1998, to (1) improve understanding of geographic fat-deposition patterns by adding a high-latitude perspective; (2) determine whether there are age-related differences in fat-deposition strategies in autumn; and (3) test the "spring fatter" hypothesis of seasonal fat-deposition, which suggests that migrants should carry more fat in spring when they near their breeding areas than in autumn when they depart. Our analyses examined factors affecting daily fat scores during migration and compared between-season differences in fat stores among a total of 18,685 individuals of 16 migrant species. In autumn, adults had higher visible subcutaneous fat scores than immatures in It of 16 species. However, in all but two species, those differences were attributable to the effects of overnight low temperature, day length, and time of day, rather than age, probably because of later departures by adults. Fat scores were higher in autumn than in spring in 6 of 16 species, and body-condition indices were higher in autumn in 5 of 16 species. Only one species showed higher fat scores in spring, but that difference was not reflected in a seasonal comparison of body-condition indices. No species arrived with high fat loads in spring, and generally low fat levels in autumn suggest that high-latitude passerine migrants in North America are paying most of the energetic costs of long-distance migration with resources obtained en route to their wintering grounds. Among passerine migrants near these high-latitude breeding grounds, seasonal fat-deposition strategies appear to be responding to energetic needs at the level of daily maintenance, rather than to hypothesized insurance needs in spring or to the forthcoming needs of a long-distance migration in autumn.

J	Scriber, JM; Ording, GJ				Scriber, JM; Ording, GJ			Ecological speciation without host plant specialization; possible origins of a recently described cryptic Papilio species	ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA					12th International Symposium on Insect-Plant Relationships (SIP 12)	2002	Berlin, GERMANY					North American Papilio canadensis and P. glaucus (Lepidoptera: Papilionidae, these Papilio = Pterourus) have previously been described as having allopatric distributions separated by a narrow hybrid zone running from Minnesota to southern New England, and southward in the Appalachian Mountains (possibly to northern Georgia). Recent patterns of hybridization and introgression suggest a more complex interaction between the two, possibly even resulting in the formation of a new species (Pterourus appalachiensis Pavulaan & Wright, 2002). Recently, extensive northward interspecific introgression of P. glaucus-diagnostic traits has been observed in the hybrid zone. These include wing bands and other color patterns, the ability to feed on tulip tree leaves, and Hk-100 allozymes; all are autosomally encoded. However, there has been little northward introgression of certain other P. glaucus traits (such as facultative diapause and bivoltinism, and Ldh-100 allozymes, both X-linked; and the Y-linked melanic mimicry gene in females). Interspecific recombination of the X-chromosome has evidently occurred, as shown by discordant patterns of X-linked markers. The P. glaucus X-linked Pgd-100 and Pgd-50 alleles have introgressed 200-400 km north of the historical hybrid zone, yet the P. glaucus X-linked Ldh-100 allele has not. The allele frequency shift for both genes is more closely related to the 'thermal landscape' (i.e., accumulated degree-days above a developmental base threshold of 50 degrees F (=10 degrees C)) than to latitude. Delayed post-diapause eclosion of cohorts within the hybrid zone, e.g., the New York/Vermont border area, has produced a natural 'false-second generation' flight (a hybrid swarm of synchronous males and females, where 2300-2700 degrees F degree-days have accumulated each year since 1998) that is reproductively isolated from flights of both parental species. Moreover, the newly described P. appalachiensis exhibits a unique combination of traits. These include obligate diapause, a univoltine habit, and the Ldh-80 or Ldh-40 alleles (as for P. canadensis), the Pgd-100 or Pgd-50 alleles (as for P. glaucus), and a delayed 'false-second generation' reproductive flight period (as observed in the hybrid zone). Since 2001, a rare allele or 'hybrizyme' (Ldh-20) has appeared in this false second generation at high frequencies (40-50%). We hypothesize that strong selection against the facultative diapause (od-)trait (and the linked Ldh-100 allele) in regions with 2800 degrees F degree-days or less, and divergent selection in favor of Pgd-100 (or a closely linked trait) combined with allochronic reproductive isolation, has resulted in recombinational, parapatric, hybrid speciation. There is no evidence at present that host-plant shifts or changes in sex pheromones have driven this process, in contrast to many other speciation events in the Lepidoptera.																	0013-8703					APR	2005	115	1					247	263		10.1111/j.1570-7458.2005.00285.x								WOS:000228560200030						
J	Hoffmann, AA; Shirriffs, J; Scott, M				Hoffmann, AA; Shirriffs, J; Scott, M			Relative importance of plastic vs genetic factors in adaptive differentiation: geographical variation for stress resistance in Drosophila melanogaster from eastern Australia	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												1. Heritable clinal patterns for stress resistance traits have been described in a number of invertebrate species but patterns are usually characterized on populations reared under constant conditions. Here we examined the impact of simulated seasonal variation in temperature/photoperiod as well as constant conditions on stress resistance in eight Drosophila melanogaster populations from eastern Australia across a latitude range of 27 degrees. 2. Desiccation resistance was relatively higher under summer compared with winter/constant conditions, but this trait and starvation resistance did not exhibit clinal variation. Winter conditions increased cold resistance as measured by chill coma recovery time, and decreased heat resistance as measured by time to knock down in a vial. 3. Clinal patterns were evident for the thermal resistance traits regardless of conditions, and involved increased heat resistance and decreased cold resistance in tropical populations. Latitudinal patterns were steeper for cold resistance than for heat resistance. 4. To compare the relative impact of plastic vs genetic changes along the cline, differences in trait means were expressed relative to differences between populations from cline ends. For cold and heat resistance, differences between environmental conditions were approximately 1.5x greater than the heritable differences. 1				Hoffmann, Ary/C-2961-2011													0269-8463					APR	2005	19	2					222	227		10.1111/j.1365-2435.2005.00959.x								WOS:000229370500004						
J	Boulos, Z; Macchi, MM				Boulos, Z; Macchi, MM			Season- and latitude-dependent effects of simulated twilights on circadian entrainment	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL RHYTHMS												Groups of Syrian hamsters were exposed to LD cycles with twilight transitions and photoperiods simulating natural lighting conditions at the summer solstice (SS), equinox, and winter solstice (WS) at 41 degrees N and at the winter solstice at the Arctic Circle (WS 66 degrees N) but with daytime illuminance truncated at 10 lux (LD-twilight). Separate groups were kept under matching rectangular cycles (LD-rectangular). The inclusion of twilights affected several circadian parameters in a season- and latitude-dependent manner. The most striking difference was in the timing of activity onsets, which followed dusk in the presence of twilights but were more closely related to dawn (lights-on) in their absence, Activity offsets and midpoints were also earlier in LD-twilight than in LD-rectangular, with the differences being most pronounced under WS 66 degrees N. In LD-twilight, longer nights resulted in earlier offsets and midpoints, but in LD-rectangular, midpoints were later under long than under short nights while offsets did not vary significantly. In LD-twilight, activity duration (alpha) increased monotonically with increasing nighttime duration, but in LD-rectangular, alpha was shorter under WS 66 degrees N than under WS conditions. These effects of season and latitude observed in LD-twilight were similar to those reported in animals exposed to natural illumination, while those observed in LD-rectangular differed in several respects. The presence of twilights also resulted in lower day-to-day variability in activity onset times (greater precision), supporting the earlier conclusion that twilights increase the strength of the LD zeitgeber. Free-running periods in constant darkness (DD) were shorter in LD-twilight than in LD-rectangular, especially under WS 66 degrees N, raising the possibility that the effects of twilights on the timing of the entrained activity rhythm reflect their effects on the period of that rhythm. Increasing daytime illuminance to 100 lux (WS conditions only) resulted in earlier activity offsets and midpoints and a shorter alpha but had no effect on activity onsets or on subsequent period in DD. These results indicate that exposure to low twilight illuminances alone can account for several of the documented differences between the effects of natural and rectangular light cycles on circadian entrainment.

C. nodosa exhibits both sexual reproduction and vegetative propagation by rhizome elongation. Seeds remain buried in the sediment nearby the mother plant in a dormant stage until germination. Seed dispersal potential is therefore expected to be extremely restricted. High clonal diversity (up to 67% of distinct genotypes) and a highly intermingled configuration of genets at different spatial scales were found. No significant differences in genetic structure were found among the three spatial scales, indicating that genetic diversity is evenly distributed along the meadow. Autocorrelation analyses of kinship estimates confirmed the absence of spatial clumping of genets at small spatial scale and the expectations of a very restricted seed dispersal (observed dispersal range 1-21 m) in this species.

J	Baskin, JM; Baskin, CC; Tyndall, RW				Baskin, JM; Baskin, CC; Tyndall, RW			Natural Areas Journal - Introduction	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL												Dormancy in seeds of Aeschynomene virginica is caused by a water-impermeable ("hard") seed coat. In the laboratory, dormancy was broken by mechanical scarification, dry heat, wet heat (boiling), dry storage, incubation on a moist substrate for several months, and (to a lesser extent) freezing. Wetting/drying cycles were ineffective in breaking dormancy. Nondormant seeds germinated over a wide range of temperatures in both white light and darkness, in far-red light, at salinities (NaCl, Na2SO4, MgSO4) of 0-1%, and while flooded or buried in soil. Fewer seedlings emerged from nondormant seeds buried > 3 cm in soil than from those buried 1 or 2 cm; emergence was 93% at 1 cm and 19% at 5 cm. Germination of only a few of the dormant seeds sown on the soil surface in a nonheated greenhouse in autumn 1995 was delayed until spring 1997, while 44% of those buried 7 cm deep in soil were still dormant ("hard") in spring 1999. Thus, it seems likely that A. virginica has the potential to form a persistent seed bank in its natural habitat.																	0885-8608	2162-4399				APR	2005	25	2					147	155										WOS:000228816700007						
J	Dzialak, MR; Lacki, MJ; Carter, KM				Dzialak, MR; Lacki, MJ; Carter, KM			Characterization of potential release sites for peregrine falcon reintroduction	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL												As part of an effort to recover the peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) in southeastern cliff habitats, we implemented a pre-release habitat evaluation designed to characterize cliffs in Kentucky and identify those suited as reintroduction sites. The evaluation included field and Geographic Information System (GIS) analyses of available habitat and estimation of available prey and predation risk. We evaluated 32 sites in three physiographic regions in Kentucky. Cliff habitats reflected differences in land use and physiography among regions. Features that distinguished central Kentucky sites (Bluegrass) from eastern Kentucky sites (Cumberland Plateau and Cumberland Mountains) included a greater (x) over bar +/- SD proportion of adjacent non-forested habitat (0.5 +/- 0.01 and 0.08 +/- 0.05, respectively), a better estimated prey base, and higher estimated relative abundance of great horned owls (Bubo virginianus; 0.5 and 0.0 owl detections/hr survey effort, respectively). Two natural areas, the Red River Gorge Geologic Area and the Tom Dorman State Nature Preserve, emerged well suited for the program. These sites were characterized by large cliffs, historic occurrence of peregrine falcons, adequate prey availability, and other features relevant to conservation, research, and educational considerations in raptor reintroduction such as site accessibility and public land. An implicit objective of pre-release research in wildlife reintroduction should be to establish conservation and research objectives and to generate information that can be applied in a retrospective assessment of specific factors affecting program outcome.																	0885-8608					APR	2005	25	2					188	196										WOS:000228816700012						
J	Doyon, J; Boivin, G				Doyon, J; Boivin, G			The effect of development time on the fitness of female Trichogramma evanescens	JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE												Trichogramma are facultative gregarious egg parasitoids that attack a wide range of lepidopterous eggs. Because hosts in which parasitoids develop vary in terms of available food, the progeny produced by parasitoid females vary in size and fitness. While one might expect that the developmental rate and emergence rhythm should be similar for all individuals reared under the same environmental conditions, variations in the duration of development of individuals reared under uniform conditions have been found in several insect species. In the Hymenopteran egg parasitoid Trichogramma evanescens Westwood ( Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) adults emerge at the beginning of the photoperiod on two consecutive days. Longer development may influence the fitness of adults and have an impact on mating opportunities. Size, longevity and daily and lifetime fecundity were measured for female T. evanescens that developed in nine and ten days. We observed a significant relationship between size and both longevity and lifetime fecundity. While early emerging females did not live longer and did not produce progeny with a different sex-ratio than females that emerged later, they were larger and produced more progeny than late females. We conclude that early emerging females have a higher fitness than late emerging females T. evanescens.																	1536-2442					MAR 16	2005	5								4	10.1093/jis/5.1.4								WOS:000228141400002	16299594					
J	Svensson, BW				Svensson, BW			Seasonal fat content fluctuations in a gyrinid beetle: comparison between an arctic and a temperate zone population (Coleoptera : Gyrinidae)	AQUATIC INSECTS												Seasonal fluctuations in fat content ( percentage of dry body weight) of adult Gyrinus opacus were compared between a lake population at the northern range limit of the species in Greenland ( G) and a rock pool population in south-central Sweden ( S) near its southern range limit. From equally low values at emergence in summer, beetles of both populations accumulated substantial fat reserves, especially during their first weeks as adults. Hardened S-beetles were fatter than G-beetles at time of onset of hibernation. For late emerging ( soft) G-beetles, however, the situation was severe because of an immediate freeze-up of the lake. There was a similar winter fat decline in both populations. During the first month after hibernation there was a significant decrease in fat content of the S-beetles, because they were still utilizing their fat deposits from the previous autumn. This trend was broken at the first emergence peak of chironomids in spring. Hibernating G-beetles used their lesser fat storage to the same extent, and led to some reproductive females reaching extremely low levels of fat. Still lower fat content and smaller body size of beetles in a closely situated small lake to G in early spring shows a between locality variation related to differences in habitat quality at the northern range limit.																	0165-0424					MAR	2005	27	1					11	19		10.1080/01650420400000304								WOS:000231567900002						
J	Lopez-Garcia, MC; Maillet, J				Lopez-Garcia, MC; Maillet, J			Biological characteristics of an invasive south African species	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Senecio inaequidens, a south African species that has recently invaded parts of Europe, especially human disturbed habitats, was examined under laboratory and glasshouse conditions to assess the germination of achenes, soil seed banks, growth of seedlings and its breeding system. These observations allowed identification of ecological characteristics that may contribute to the invasiveness of the species. Achenes derived from three populations of S. inaequidens were germinated over a wide temperature range ( from 14/6 degrees C day/night temperatures to a constant temperature of 30 degrees C). They exhibited a rapid achene germination especially when temperatures reached 20 degrees C. Germination of seeds from soil samples also exhibited a prolonged germination over time suggesting therefore different types of dormancy. Growth response was studied along a nitrogen gradient from 0.33 to 16.0 mmol l(-1) and data were interpreted using growth analysis. Seedlings of S. inaequidens exhibited a slow growth in low nutrient availability and a rapid growth rate when exposed to high nutrient availability, which contributed to producing a large leaf area and biomass. Four types of pollination were studied in S. inaequidens. Hand-pollinations showed that S. inaequidens was mostly self-incompatible. Self-pollinated capitula only showed 7.6% viable achenes, significantly lower than insect-pollinated and cross-pollinated capitula. Some individuals were more self-fertile than others ensuring the production of some offspring in a situation of colonisation. Natural pollination occurred with generalist insects. Most of these results confirm the invasive ability of S. inaequidens.																	1387-3547					MAR	2005	7	2					181	194		10.1007/s10530-004-8978-5								WOS:000227957800004						
J	Anderson, KJ; Jetz, W				Anderson, KJ; Jetz, W			The broad-scale ecology of energy expenditure of endotherms	ECOLOGY LETTERS												Energy expenditure in animals scales allometrically with body mass, but residual variation is not well understood. We examine the existing data on field metabolic rates (FMR) in endotherms for the potential role of environmental conditions. Across latitude, mass-corrected FMR of 248 bird and mammal populations fall between two constraint lines: a lower bound that increases towards the poles and is driven by environmental factors and an upper bound that is invariant with latitude and may represent physiological limitations. This triangular pattern can be explained statistically with a multipredictor model that combines environmental conditions and species biology (including phylogeny). Lower environmental temperature and longer day length increase FMR, while taxonomy and diet explain much of the remaining variation. Combined, these effects appear to form a diversity of 'metabolic niches' that overall decreases from the tropics to the poles. The potential of factors related to latitude acting as constraints on the ecology and evolution of metabolic strategies in endotherms is discussed.																	1461-023X	1461-0248				MAR	2005	8	3					310	318		10.1111/j.1461-0248.2005.00723.x								WOS:000227249400009

Three years of field observations and experiments revealed that not all beetles overwintered in the soil next to their principal host Adenostyles alliariae (Asteraceae), as was previously assumed, but that many O. cacaliae left their host in autumn and flew to overwintering sites that were extensively sun-exposed. In spring, these individuals became active 2 months earlier than their conspecifics that had remained in the soil close to the host plant. These early beetles flew from their hibernation sites against the direction of the prevailing wind. After a random landing in snow, they walked to the spring host Petasites paradoxus (Asteraceae) and fed on its floral stalks, the only plant parts present at that time. A few weeks later, they took flight again to locate newly emerging A. alliariae on which they would feed and deposit larvae as did individuals that had overwintered close to A. alliariae. Leaves of A. alliariae contain pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs), which the beetles sequester for their own defence. The dominating PA (seneciphylline) was also found to be present in the floral stalks of P. paradoxus. With additional behavioural assays in the field and laboratory, we demonstrated the importance of plant odours in the short-range host location process. This study reveals a unique hibernation behaviour in which part of the beetle population uses exceptionally warm locations from which they emerge in spring, long before all the snow has melted. This early, but risky emergence allows them to exploit a second, highly suitable host plant, which they locate first by wind-guided flight and then by odour-guided walking. The well-fed beetles then use odour again to move to their principal host plant, on which they reproduce.

J	Macleod, R; Barnett, P; Clark, JA; Cresswell, W				Macleod, R; Barnett, P; Clark, JA; Cresswell, W			Body mass change strategies in blackbirds Turdus merula: the starvation-predation risk trade-off	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												1. It is theoretically well established that body mass in birds is the consequence of a trade-off between starvation risk and predation risk. There are, however, no studies of mass variation from sufficiently large wild populations to model in detail the range of diurnal and seasonal mass change patterns in natural populations and how these are linked to the complex environmental and biological variables that may affect the trade-off. 2. This study used data on 17 000 individual blackbirds Turdus merula to model how mass changes diurnally and seasonally over the whole year and over a wide geographical area. Mass change was modelled in respect of temperature, rainfall, day length, geographical location, time of day and time of year and the results show how these mass changes vary with individual size, age and sex. 3. The hypothesis that seasonal mass is optimized over the year and changes in line with predictors of foraging uncertainty was tested. As theory predicts, reduced day length and reduced temperature result in increased mass and the expected seasonal peak of mass in midwinter. 4. The hypothesis that diurnal mass gain is optimized in terms of starvation-predation risk trade-off theory was also tested. The results provide the first empirical evidence for intraspecies seasonal changes in diurnal mass gain patterns. These changes are consistent with shifts in the relative importance of starvation risk and predation risk and with the theory of mass-dependent predation risk. 5. In winter most mass was gained in the morning, consistent with reducing starvation risk. In contrast, during the August-November non-breeding period a bimodal pattern of mass gain, with increases just after dawn and before dusk, was adopted and the majority of mass gain occurred at the end of the day consistent with reducing mass-dependent predation risk. The bimodal diurnal mass gain pattern described here is the first evidence that bird species in the wild gain mass in this theoretically predicted pattern.

J	Bakhmet, IN				Bakhmet, IN			Electrophysiological study of effects of environmental factors on respiration and cardiac activity in the fry of the Atlantic salmon Salmo salar	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY												Effects of temperature and level of illumination on cardiac and respiratory rhythms have been analyzed in the juvenile Atlantic salmon Salmo salar L. at different stages of ontogenesis. The study was carried out under field conditions, which allowed avoiding to a considerable degree the effect of artifacts due to chemical and physical properties of water and to fish transposition. The "handling" reaction of the fry cardiac and respiratory activities was examined. A statistically significant decrease of the respiration rate (RR) by the 30th min and of the heart rate (HR) by the 15th min of experiment was revealed. A more expressed reaction of the decrease of cardiac and respiratory activities after transfer to the working chamber was found in juvenile salmons at early stages of their development. A linear dependence of frequency characteristics of electrocardiograms and electropneumograms (ECG and EPG) was shown in parrs and smolts on temperature in the range from 4 to 24 degrees C. According to reaction of the respiratory system of smolts; there was identified a signaling significance of the illumination level in the range of 10-20 kLx, which is confirmed by data on fish behavior in nature. Study of the changes in EEG and EPG allowed suggesting the presence of correlation of frequency characteristics of cardiac and respiratory activities of juvenile salmons with the metabolic level. However, moments of fundamental organism rearrangement in smolts are to be identified, which complicates the use of RR and HR as the measure of the metabolic level at this stage of the Atlantic salmon development.																	0022-0930					MAR-APR	2005	41	2					176	184		10.1007/s10893-005-0052-0								WOS:000229864100008

Single female and male weevils are tested in the arena 2, 4 and 6 days after termination of diapause, during photophase and during scotophase. During photophase, weevils of both sexes choose the warmest part of the temperature gradient arena, irrespective of the time elapsed after diapause. During scotophase, high temperature is favoured by male weevils, as well as by females 2 and 4 days after diapause. However, 6 days after termination of diapause, females show no thermal preference in the temperature gradient arena during scotophase, indicating that thermal choice of female A. pomorum in the scotophase changes with time after the termination of diapause. The results suggest that both sexes benefit from thermoregulation by habitat choice during photophase when the weevils are flight active and colonize apple trees.

J	Bicca-Marques, JC; Gomes, DF				Bicca-Marques, JC; Gomes, DF			Birth seasonality of Cebus apella (Platyrrhini, Cebidae) in Brazilian zoos along a latitudinal gradient	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY												Birth seasonality in wild neotropical primates has been suggested to increase with latitude as a response to a stronger divergence in highquality food availability across the year, and a higher between-year predictability at higher latitudes related to temporal differences in photoperiod. In captivity, however, monkeys are fed foods of similar quality throughout the year, and this consistency of diet should have a releasing effect on the need for birth seasonality. In this paper, we test whether 1) brown capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella) breed seasonally in captivity, and 2) given the consistency of diet in this setting, differences in latitude are reflected in the temporal pattern of birth distribution across the year. Data on the distribution of birth records of C. apella at Brazilian zoos located within three latitudinal zones (Equator 8degreesS, 16degrees -- 24degreesS, and 24degrees 32degreesS) are compared. Captive C. apella showed a birth peak from October to February, despite the consistent provision of food in this setting. In addition, there were no differences in the pattern of birth distribution among the latitudinal zones, which lends no support to the prediction that captive C. apella birth seasonality would increase with latitude. We suggest that if this species is not sensitive to subtle differences in photoperiod, other environmental cues may trigger the onset of reproduction at lower latitudes. (C) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

J	Williams, PR; Congdon, RA; Grice, AC; Clarke, PJ				Williams, PR; Congdon, RA; Grice, AC; Clarke, PJ			Germinable soil seed banks in a tropical savanna: seasonal dynamics and effects of fire	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												The germinable soil seed bank of a tropical eucalypt savanna of north-eastern Australia was found to be dominated by grasses and forbs, with seed bank density ranging from 58 to 792 seeds per square metre, from a total of 53 species. Late dry season fires and the fire-related cues, heat shock and smoke, broke the seed dormancy of a range of tropical savanna species. Heat shock promoted the germination of the species groups natives, exotics, subshrubs, ephemeral and twining perennial forbs, and the common species Indigofera hirsuta, Pycnospora lutescens and Triumfetta rhomboidea. Exposure to smoke at ambient temperature promoted germination from the soil seed bank of the species groups combined natives, upright perennial forbs and grasses, as well as the common grasses Digitaria breviglumis and Heteropogon triticeus. The germinable soil seed bank varied seasonally, increasing from the mid wet season (February) and early dry season (May) to a maximum in the late dry season (October). The effect of recent fire history on soil seed bank dynamics was limited to the immediate release of some seed from dormancy; a reduction in seed densities of subshrubs and monocots, other than grasses, in recently burnt savanna; and enhanced seed density of the ephemeral I. hirsuta in the year following fire. The seed banks of most savanna species were replenished in the year following burning.

J	Rizzolo, DJ; Esler, D; Roby, DD; Jarvis, RL				Rizzolo, DJ; Esler, D; Roby, DD; Jarvis, RL			Do wintering Harlequin Ducks forage nocturnally at high latitudes?	CONDOR												We monitored radio-tagged Harlequin Ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus) to determine whether nocturnal feeding was part of their foraging strategy during winter in south-central Alaska. Despite attributes of our study site (low ambient temperatures, harsh weather, short day length) and study species (small body size, high daytime foraging rates) that would be expected to favor nocturnal foraging, we found no evidence of nocturnal dive-feeding. Signals from eight radio-tagged Harlequin Ducks never exhibited signal loss due to diving during a total of 780 minutes of nocturnal monitoring. In contrast, the same eight birds exhibited signal loss during 62 +/- 7% (SE) of 5-minute diurnal monitoring periods (total of 365 minutes of monitoring). Our results suggest that Harlequin Ducks in south-central Alaska face a stringent time constraint on daytime foraging during midwinter. Harlequin Ducks wintering at high latitudes, therefore, may be particularly sensitive to factors that increase foraging requirements or decrease foraging efficiency.

J	Teixeira, LAF; Polavarapu, S				Teixeira, LAF; Polavarapu, S			Diapause development in the blueberry maggot Rhagoletis mendax (Diptera : Tephritidae)	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												Pupal diapause in the blueberry maggot was studied to characterize the relationship between temperature and development during different phases of diapause and determine the traits responsible for the late adult emergence period in some populations present in blueberry fields in southern New Jersey. Pupae in the refractory phase of diapause were exposed to 1, 4, or VC for 45, 90, or 135 d, and in a separate experiment, to 11 or 15degreesC for similar periods of time, to determine temperature thresholds and rates of diapause development at constant temperature. Results showed that pupae took much longer to reach the activated phase of diapause when exposed to IT than 4 or VC and were able to reach the activated phase when exposed to up to 15degreesC. In the range of 4-15degreesC, diapause development was largely independent from temperature. Pupae in the activated phase of diapause were exposed to 7,15,20,25,30,25:35 (12:12 h), and 35degreesC for 10 d. There was a linear increase in the development rate in the range of 7-30degreesC, and the development rate was similar at 30, 25:35 (12:12 h), and 35degreesC. The proportion of pupae reaching the activated phase of diapause from August to February in a normal early population and front October to February in a late population was compared by keeping pupae in the refractory phase outdoors in a screenhouse and bringing samples to 20degreesC monthly. Data showed that pupae of both early and late populations reached the activated phase from October to January. The duration of the activated phase of diapause in pupae of early and late populations kept at 20degreesC after exposure to cold was compared by measuring changes in their respiration rates. Results showed that the activated phase lasted 10-20 d in the early population versus 60-70 d in the late population. In the blueberry maggot, and possibly in other Rhagoletis species, adaptation of the adult emergence period to the fruiting period of different host plants seems to be mediated by changes in the duration of the activated phase of diapause.																	0046-225X					FEB	2005	34	1					47	53		10.1603/0046-225X-34.1.47								WOS:000226895100007

A residual heterozygous line (RHL) of soybean ( Glycine max) derived from a recombinant inbred line (RIL) was used for. fine-mapping FT1, which is a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) responsible for soybean flowering time. The residual heterozygous line RHL1-156 was selected from the RILs that were derived from two distantly related varieties, Misuzudaizu and Moshidou Gong503. The genome of RHL1-156 contains a heterozygous segment (approximately 17 cM) surrounding the FT1 locus but is homozygous in other regions, including three other loci affecting flowering time. A large segregating population of 1,006 individuals derived by selfing of RHL1-156 included two homozygous genotypes for the nearest marker of FT1 whose flowering time differed by 26 days. No continuous range of phenotypes was observed, in contrast to the F-2 population, suggesting that a single FT1 locus affected the flowering time in the RHL1-156 line. Linkage analysis revealed that the FT1 locus mapped as a single Mendelian factor between two tightly linked DNA markers, Satt365 and GM169, at distances of approximately 0.1 cM and 0.4 cM, respectively. Our results show that a RHL derived from RILs can be used to fine-map a QTL and that RHLs can be an efficient tool for a systematic. fine-mapping of QTLs.																	0040-5752					FEB	2005	110	4					634	639		10.1007/s00122-004-1886-3								WOS:000227714400005	15657740					
J	Avery, DE				Avery, DE			Induction of embryonic dormancy in the calanoid copepod Acartia hudsonica: heritability and phenotypic plasticity in two geographically separated populations	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												The planktonic copepod Acartia hudsonica apparently requires summer diapause or dormancy to persist in Narragansett Bay, RI. In estuaries to the north, however, active A. hudsonica populations are present year-round and may not express dormancy. Using a full-sibling rearing design and analysis of variance (ANOVA), I assessed the importance of phenotypic and genetic sources of variation in two geographically separate populations, one from Maine and one from Rhode Island. Both populations showed phenotypic plasticity in the percentage of dormant eggs produced. Moreover, experiments revealed significant sibship-environment interactions in both populations, indicating that the phenotypic plasticity has a genetic component. Both populations also revealed a significant amount of genetic variation in the percentage of dormant eggs produced. For the Maine population, broad sense heritability was high (0.91, 1.10) in two short-day (12L:12D) treatments and near zero (0.08) in the long-day treatment (15L:9D). For a Rhode Island population, broad sense heritability was higher (0.95) in a low-temperature short-day treatment (13.5 degreesC, 12L: 12D) than in a high-temperature short-day treatment (17.5 degreesC, 12L: 12D; h(2)=0.25).

J	Zhang, MH; Wilhoit, L; Geiger, C				Zhang, MH; Wilhoit, L; Geiger, C			Assessing dormant season organophosphate use in California almonds	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Organophosphate (OP) pesticides were recommended during the dormant season to control overwintering insects such as peach twig borer, San Jose scale, European red mite, and brown mite in California almond and stone fruit orchards. However, since 1990, dormant OP use had fallen under increased scrutiny due to surface water contamination concerns. Studies have shown positive correlation between OP use and residue load in surface water. The purpose of this study is to assess the trends and regional patterns of OP use in almond orchards, and to identify factors that may have influenced those trends, including weather, pest pressure. and use of alternatives to OP such as pyrethroid, dormant oils, and Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) for the assessment of the impacts to surface water quality. Pesticide use data from the California Department of Pesticide Regulation were analyzed. Regression analyses were used to assess trends front 1992 to 2000, and a geographic information system (GIS) was used to visualize the spatial variation in pesticide use. Results from this study indicated that, statewide, dormant OP use decreased while the use of some alternatives, such as dormant pyrethroid, no dormant insecticides, and in-season pyrethroid, oil alone, and Bt. increased in the last 9 years. The significant decreasing trend of OP use was observed for the measures of kilogram per hectare crop planted, percentage of total planted hectare treated, and numbers of growers who applied dormant OP. The reduction of dormant OP use appeared in all major almond-growing counties. Correlation analyses revealed that more rain was associated with less dormant OP use. A higher percent of almond damage, or rejects, was related to higher OP use in the following dormant season and in-season periods. However, the effects of weather and percent of nut rejects can only explain small portion of the variations in dormant OP use. Therefore, in addition to weather and pest pressures, economic pressures and various outreach and extension programs may also have played a role in encouraging farmers to reduce their use of dormant OP.

On the other hand, olive pollen is one of the main causes of pollen allergy in the Mediterranean area. Olive flowering is affected by climatic factors such as temperature and photoperiod, which vary geographically in latitude and altitude. Temperature has been used to study those processes that lead to flowering in the olive tree. The aim of the present paper is firstly the comparison of the flowering full bloom dates in two Mediterranean areas, Sicily (Italy) and Cordoba (Spain), located in the same latitudinal band (37-38 degrees N) and to calculate the heat requirement until flowering by determination of different threshold temperatures and methods of heat accumulation. A delay of the full flowering dates in the Spanish compared with the Italian olive groves was observed. The most suitable threshold temperatures were carried out in a 7 degrees-15 degrees C range by considering the heat accumulation start on 1 January in each olive grove. In particular, some causes were indicated as responsible for the different threshold temperatures recorded in the 2 study areas: First, the different climatic conditions (continental and insular climate) secondly the different cultivars present in the olive groves.

J	Vivian-Smith, G; Panetta, FD				Vivian-Smith, G; Panetta, FD			Seedling recruitment, seed persistence and aspects of dispersal ecology of the invasive moth vine, Araujia sericifera ( Asclepiadaceae)	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												We investigated germination, seedling emergence and seed persistence of the invasive moth vine (Araujia sericifera Brot.) under controlled and field conditions in south-eastern Queensland. Fresh seed showed high viability (99.5%) and germinated readily, with 97.2% of all recorded germinations occurring within 14 days. Mean germination rates ranged from 74 to 100% across the range of temperature (10/20 degrees C, 15/25 degrees C and 20/30 degrees C alternating 12-h thermoperiods) and light (0- and 12-h photoperiods) treatments. Germination was significantly reduced only under cool, dark conditions. In a 24-month field experiment, seedling emergence was greatest for seeds buried at 1 cm (mean = 96.3%), intermediate for seeds buried at 5 cm (mean = 62.7%) and least for surface-sown seeds (mean = 30.7%). Seed persistence under field conditions was low, declining rapidly to 3.9% at 6 months and to 0.67% at 24 months. Moth vine's capacity to germinate readily and the rapid depletion of seeds under field conditions indicate that the species has a transient seed bank in south-eastern Queensland. In an additional experiment testing the capacity of seeds for secondary dispersal by water, the mean floating time of seeds was 15.4 days, suggesting that water could act as a secondary dispersal vector, contributing to long-distance dispersal. We recommend that surveillance methods for detecting moth-vine populations should consider both water-flow patterns and wind direction.																	0067-1924	1444-9862					2005	53	3					225	230		10.1071/BT04118								WOS:000229339400005						
J	Halliday, RB				Halliday, RB			Systematics and biology of Penthaleus tectus sp n.

It has previously been confused with the blue oat mite Penthaleus major (Duges). Penthaleus tectus differs from P. major morphologically and genetically, and in geographical distribution, response to pesticides, and the timing of diapause. Previous records of 'P. major' from Australia and other countries probably include a mixture of several species. Penthaleus minor (Canestrini) is recorded from South Africa for the first time.																	1326-6756						2005	44		2				144	149		10.1111/j.1440-6055.2005.00454.x								WOS:000228752200008						
J	Goodwin, S				Goodwin, S			A new strategy for the chemical control of fig longicorn, Acalolepta vastator (Newman) (Coleoptera : Cerambycidae), infesting grapevines	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY												Difficulties in controlling the grapevine borer pest fig longicorn, Acalolepta vastator, were experienced. Variable results with azinphos-methyl, chlorpyrifos and methidathion applied as seasonal sprays at 2-weekly or monthly intervals, coupled with inconsistent grower spraying practices, provided unreliable control. Pest resurgence resulted in a range of new chemicals and usage strategies being tested to overcome the problem. After extensive trialling an effective strategy for control of A. vastator was developed. This involved a single application of insecticide at dormancy, and after vineyard pruning, at a much higher rate than that normally registered for crop use. Bifenthrin (Talstar 100 EC) at 1000 mL/100 L, fipronil (Regent 200 SC) at 100 mL/100 L and imidacloprid (Confidor 350 SC) at 200 mL/100 L controlled emerging adults and young. This strategy overcomes a number of problems experienced with the previous chemical application method for this pest.																	1326-6756						2005	44		2				170	174		10.1111/j.1440-6055.2005.00439.x								WOS:000228752200013						
J	Pereyra, ME; Sharbaugh, SM; Hahn, TP				Pereyra, ME; Sharbaugh, SM; Hahn, TP			Interspecific variation in photo-induced GnRH plasticity among nomadic cardueline finches	BRAIN BEHAVIOR AND EVOLUTION												Changes in response to photoperiod are of fundamental importance to seasonal cycles in avian reproductive development. In this study we present data on photo-induced changes in gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) immunoreactivity associated with the development of photorefractoriness in males of 3 closely related species of cardueline finch: common redpoll (Carduelis flammea), pine siskin (C. pinus) and white-winged crossbill (Loxia leucoptera). All are nomadic, mid- to high-latitude breeders with varying levels of reproductive flexibility: redpolls are typically seasonal, pine siskins more flexibly seasonal and white-winged crossbills temporally opportunistic. Males were exposed to either long (20L: 4D) or short days (5L: 19D), beginning in January, and GnRH was assessed via immunocytochemistry 4.5 months later. Plasma LH, testis size, and molt score were also measured. Significant reductions in the number of irGnRH cells detected, cross-sectional cell area and optical density of these cells occurred in both redpolls and siskins on long, as compared with short, days. These decreases in irGnRH, coupled with spontaneous testicular regression and onset of molt were consistent with the development of absolute photorefractoriness on constant long days. In contrast, the tendency for numbers of GnRH immunopositive cells and mean measures of GnRH immunoreactivity ( cell area, optical density and axonal fiber density) to decrease were much more moderate in white-winged crossbills held on long versus short days. Although none of the four measures of GnRH immunoreactivity differed significantly between treatments in crossbills, significant shifts in the frequency distribution of irGnRH neurons to include greater numbers of less immunoreactive cells suggested that antigenic GnRH content was reduced in many cells. These photo-induced shifts in optical densities of GnRH cells in long-day, as compared with short-day crossbills followed, to a lesser extent, the pattern in pine siskins and common redpolls. For all three species, patterns of decrease in GnRH immunoreactivity, gonadal regression and molt suggest that some form of refractoriness to photostimulation develops on constant long days. However, more moderate tendencies for GnRH immunoreactivity to decrease in white-winged crossbills, coupled with limited gonadal regression and molt on long days suggest that absolute photorefractoriness might develop more slowly in this taxon than in others, or alternatively, a condition arises that is more similar to relative photorefractoriness. These data indicate that relatively small differences in the response of the neuroendocrine system to stimulatory cues such as day length may lead to remarkably different capabilities for reproductive flexibility even within a closely related family of birds.

J	Vera, LM; Lopez-Olmeda, JF; Bayarri, MJ; Madrid, JA; Sanchez-Vazquez, FJ				Vera, LM; Lopez-Olmeda, JF; Bayarri, MJ; Madrid, JA; Sanchez-Vazquez, FJ			Influence of light intensity on plasma melatonin and locomotor activity rhythms in tench	CHRONOBIOLOGY INTERNATIONAL												Melatonin production by the pineal organ is influenced by light intensity, as has been described in most vertebrate species, in which melatonin is considered a synchronizer of circadian rhythms. In tench, strict nocturnal activity rhythms have been described, although the role of melatonin has not been clarified. In this study we investigated daily activity and melatonin rhythms under 12: 12 light-dark (LD) conditions with two different light intensities (58.6 and 1,091 mu W/cm(2)), and the effect of 1 h broad spectrum white light pulses of different intensities (3.3, 5.3, 10.5, 1,091.4 mu W/cm(2)) applied at middarkness (MD) on nocturnal circulating melatonin. The results showed that plasma melatonin in tench under LD 12: 12 and high light conditions displayed rhythmic variation, where values at MD (255.8 +/- 65.9 pg/ml) were higher than at midlight (ML) (70.7 +/- 31.9pg/ml). Such a difference between MD and ML values was reduced in animals exposed to LD 12: 12 and low light intensity. The application of 1 h light pulses at MD lowered plasma melatonin to 111.6 +/- 3.2 pg/ml (in the 3.3-10.5 mu W/cm(2) range) and to 61.8 +/- 18.3 pg/ml (with the 1,091.4 mu W/cm(2) light pulse) and totally suppressed nocturnal locomotor activity. These results show that melatonin rhythms persisted in tench exposed to low light intensity although the amplitude of the rhythm is affected. In addition, it was observed that light pulses applied at MD affected plasma melatonin content and locomotor activity. Such a low threshold suggests that the melatonin system is capable of transducing light even under dim conditions, which may be used by this nocturnal fish to synchronize to weak night light signals (e.g., moonlight cycles).

These arthropod species show a high level of Mediterranean endemism. The proportion of specialists (i.e., which feed or develop only in seed cones) is greater than in Western Europe (77 vs. 70%). Moreover, a larger proportion of species spend their entire pre-imaginal development within the cone in the Mediterranean conifers while the occurrence of prolonged diapause is less prevalent than in Western Europe. Species richness varies between 1 (Juniperus drupacea) and 13 (J. thurifera) but does not seem to depend on cone size. Significant differences in cone fauna can be observed between the different parts of the conifer range with a patchy distribution, but the differences are limited in conifers with a continuous, wide range. A severe decrease in the number of potentially-germinating seeds was observed for species with a limited distribution range such as J. thurifera and Cupressus atlantica in Morocco and J. cedrus in the Canary Islands, and for C sempervirens in both its native and introduction range. In contrast, cone pests had limited effects on the other juniper species as well as on the Pinus species. Seed bugs, Orsillus spp., also play a major part in cypress decline all over the Mediterranean because they disseminate the spores of pathogenic fungi responsible for bark canker disease.																	1159-554X		2-7380-1194-2				2005							59	78										WOS:000230647300006

In the analysis of spatial genetic variation, no isolation by distance was detected among the populations. Gene flow between populations on Hydrangea rnacrophylla and those on other host plants was relatively restricted, whereas the populations on Akebia guinata and Clerodendrum trichotontum were almost panmictic. Our study on temporal genetic variation showed (1) that population differentiation was slightly reduced during the period from April to May owing to frequent gene flow among populations; and (2) that population differentiation was greatly enhanced from May to October because of bottleneck effects. Genetic differentiation among T. kanzarvai populations was caused by the effect of host plants rather than by the effect of geographic distance among populations, suggesting possibility of sympatric host race formation in this species.

J	Arora, VK; Boer, GJ				Arora, VK; Boer, GJ			A parameterization of leaf phenology for the terrestrial ecosystem component of climate models	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Leaf phenology remains one of the most difficult processes to parameterize in terrestrial ecosystem models because our understanding of the physical processes that initiate leaf onset and senescence is incomplete. While progress has been made at the molecular level, for example by identifying genes that are associated with senescence and flowering for selected plant species, a picture of the processes controlling leaf phenology is only beginning to emerge. A variety of empirical formulations have been used with varying degrees of success in terrestrial ecosystem models for both extratropical and tropical biomes. For instance, the use of growing degree-days (GDDs) to initiate leaf onset has received considerable recognition and this approach is used in a number of models. There are, however, limitations when using GDDs and other empirically based formulations in global transient climate change simulations. The phenology scheme developed for the Canadian Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (CTEM), designed for inclusion in the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis coupled general circulation model, is described. The representation of leaf phenology is general enough to be applied over the globe and sufficiently robust for use in transient climate change simulations. Leaf phenology is functionally related to the (possibly changing) climate state and to atmospheric composition rather than to geographical boundaries or controls implicitly based on current climate. In this approach, phenology is controlled by environmental conditions as they affect the carbon balance. A carbon-gain-based scheme initiates leaf onset when it is beneficial for the plant, in carbon terms, to produce new leaves. Leaf offset is initiated by unfavourable environmental conditions that incur carbon losses and these include shorter day length, cooler temperatures, and dry soil moisture conditions. The comparison of simulated leaf onset and offset times with observation-based estimates for temperate and boreal deciduous, tropical evergreen, and tropical deciduous plant functional types at selected locations indicates that the phenology scheme performs satisfactorily. Model simulated leaf area index and stem and root biomass are also compared with observational estimates to illustrate the performance of CTEM.																	1354-1013					JAN	2005	11	1					39	59		10.1111/j.1365-2486.2004.00890.x								WOS:000225791300005						
J	Baur, A; Baur, B				Baur, A; Baur, B			Interpopulation variation in the prevalence and intensity of parasitic mite infection in the land snail Arianta arbustorum	INVERTEBRATE BIOLOGY												The parasitic mite Riccardoella limacum sucks blood in the lung of its host, the land snail Arianta arbustorum. The infection of various host populations was examined in Switzerland. In a lowland snail population, prevalence of infection did not vary among seasons. However, intensity of mite infection in dissected individuals of A. arbustorum was high in autumn, but low in winter and spring when <= 100 mite eggs were found attached to the lung epithelium. A novel, non-invasive parasite screening method was used to estimate the number of mites on living host snails. An analysis of repeatability revealed that 92.9% of the snails were correctly classified as infected or non-infected with this non-invasive method. Prevalence of mite infection was examined in 997 adults of A. arbustorum from 11 natural populations distributed over an altitudinal gradient ranging 335-2360 m. No infected snails were found in 7 populations, while in the remaining 4 populations the prevalence of mite infection ranged 45.8-77.8%. Intensity of infection also differed among the 4 host populations. No geographic pattern in prevalence of infection was found. However, parasitic mites did not occur in snail populations situated at elevations of 1290 m or higher. A possible explanation for this finding could be that the host's hibernation period may be too long at high elevations for mites and their eggs to survive. At low elevations, other factors may affect the presence of R. limacum in the lung of A. arbustorum.																	1077-8306						2005	124	3					194	201		10.1111/j.1744-7410.2005.00019.x								WOS:000231668100002						
J	Cooper, CB; Hochachka, WM; Dhondt, AA				Cooper, CB; Hochachka, WM; Dhondt, AA			Latitudinal trends in within-year reoccupation of nest boxes and their implications	JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY												Multiple brooding can substantially increase the annual reproductive output of birds, and the propensity for Multiple brooding can vary geographically. Thus, studies attempting to understand the evolution of geographic variation in nesting success need to account for variation in re-nesting potential. However, direct assessment of rates of multiple brooding requires individually recognizable breeding adults, which are not generally available. We explore the possibility of comparing relative indices of multiple broodedness across a latitudinal gradient from Studies of un-banded birds locally restricted to nest boxes. We analyzed nest box reoccupation by a multiple-brooding species, the eastern bluebird Sialia sialis, reported by volunteers in a citizen-participation project (1998-2002) in which nest boxes were monitored throughout much of the breeding range of the bluebirds. We found nest boxes in the southern portion of the bluebird range (30degrees latitude) had, on average 17-33% higher likelihood of repeated egg-laying, brooding, and successful fledging events than boxes in the north (48degrees latitude). Latitudinal variation in the reoccupation of nest boxes may indicate that either (1) the number of broods per female varies with latitude, (2) female breeding dispersal/site fidelity varies with latitude, (3) the density, distribution, and/or availability of suitable nest sites varies with latitude, or (4) observer bias varies with latitude. Various lines of evidence Suggest that nest re-occupancy is a useful index of latitudinal variation in re-nesting. During the time-frame of second attempts, first-time box occupancy was as likely as second occupancy and approximately 45% more likely in the South than north, suggesting that, despite considerable breeding dispersal, observed trends in box reoccupation conservatively reflect latitudinal trends in the number of nest attempts/broods per female. Furthermore, despite a compressed nesting cycle in the north (shorter incubation and re-nesting interval), the shorter duration of the breeding season in the north restricted the potential number of broods. Studies of banded birds are necessary to confirm the behavior underlying the latitudinal trends in box reoccupation.

This is due to excellent performance even during winter and low maintenance. The systems can be constructed regardless of site conditions. The Norwegian concept for small constructed wetlands is based on the use of a septic tank followed by an aerobic vertical down-flow biofilter succeeded by a subsurface horizontal-flow constructed wetland. The aerobic biofilter, prior to the subsurface flow stage, is essential to remove BOD and achieve nitrification in a climate where the plants are dormant during the cold season. When designed according to present guidelines a consistent P-removal of > 90% can be expected for 15 years using natural iron or calcium rich sand or a new manufactured lightweight aggregate with P-sorption capacities, which exceeds most natural media. When the media is saturated with P it can be used as soil conditioner and P-fertilizer. Nitrogen removal in the range of 40-60% is achieved. Removal of indicator bacteria is high and < 1000 thermotolerant coliforms/100 ml is normally achieved.																	1093-4529						2005	40	6-7					1343	1353		10.1081/ESE-200055846								WOS:000229287500019	15921286					
J	Carrillo, MA; Cannon, CA				Carrillo, MA; Cannon, CA			Supercooling point variability in the Indian meal moth, Plodia interpunctella (Hubner) (Lepidoptera : Pyralidae)	JOURNAL OF STORED PRODUCTS RESEARCH												Factors affecting the supercooling point (SCP) of the Indian meal moth, Plodia interpunctella (Hilbner), were investigated under various conditions. The effects of geographic origin, time under laboratory conditions, laboratory diet, stage of development, age within stage, and season on P. interpunctella SCP were examined. Overall, SCPs ranged from -28.6 to -2.4 degrees C. At the times of collection, differences in SCP between field-collected individuals and individuals from laboratory sources were negligible. The minimum observed SCP for most of the cultures tested soon after collection was below -20 degrees C. After 7 months under laboratory conditions, the mean SCP of field-collected and laboratory-reared cultures remained unchanged. No particular trend in SCP was observed when comparing cultures from northern and southern regions. Differences in laboratory diets did not affect mean SCP. Mean SCP for 1- and 4-d-old eggs was similar. Eggs (-24.4 degrees C), first instars (-23.5 degrees C), pupae (-22.2 degrees C), and adults (-22.4 degrees C) had lower mean SCPs than later instar larvae (-14.4 to -11.6 degrees C). When confined in the laboratory for 8 months under conditions which were not controlled, monthly mean SCP for the same culture varied by as much as 5.7 degrees C. Plodia interpunctella appeared to regulate its SCP as the season changed, with a relatively high mean SCP during summer and a marked decline of more than 10 degrees C in fall. The SCPs obtained in this study suggest that very low temperatures may be needed for disinfestation of P. interpunctella at all stages of development. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The output, whether standardized squared distance or probability values, represents the similarity of a given set of values with those of an optimum habitat configuration defined exclusively by sites where the species of interest is known to occur. Typically, all principal components with nonzero eigenvalues are used to calculate D(2) values. We partitioned D(2) into contributions from individual principal components (PCs) and selected PCs corresponding to relatively invariant aspects of the environment across all Use Sites to formulate D(2)(k). Partitioned Malialanobis D(2)(k) represents the similarity of a given set Of Values With those Of "mininum" habitat requirements of the species as defined by occupied Sites using the k subset of principal components. We created a GIS-based model of the habitat surrounding 39 confirmed timber rattlesnake hibernacula on the Madison County Wildlife Management Area in northwest Arkansas, USA, using slope, aspect, elevation, and 11 physical soil attributes. We retained 4 of 15 principal components in D(2)(k = 4) calculations, and minimum habitat requirements corresponded to a combination of moderate Slope, South to southwest facing slopes, and medium to high elevations. We used bootstrap and cross-validation techniques to examine the stability of the correlation matrix and the effect of each site on overall D(2)(k) values. The D(2)(k = 4) model specifically highlighted habitats similar to known rattlesnake hibernacula. We present a method to translate the probability surface into a qualitative data layer useful in making management decisions by examining the cumulative distributions of the percentages of (1) hibernacula correctly classified and (2) the study area predicted. We selected the probability threshold that maximized the predictive gain by including the greatest number of hibernacula in the smallest area. The probability threshold 0.2 captured 82% of the known hibernacula in 25% of the 5,666-ha study area. Partitioned Malialanobis D(2)(k) requires only data for where species are known to occur, thus circumventing costly errors in misclassifying habitat use with commonly used classification algorithms that require dichotomous data sets.

Here, we compare biomass, growth and production of Euphausia superba (Antarctic krill) and the copepod Calanoides acutus at South Georgia, in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. Average acoustically derived krill biomass across the 5 study years was 2.6 g C m(-2), 4 to 5 times that of Stages CIV and CV of C. acutus. Mean length of krill was 41 +/- 4 mm, and the average growth rate was 0.10 mm d(-1), giving an average mass-specific growth rate of 0.0084 d(-1). This equated to a daily gross production of krill of 0.022 g C m(-2) d(-1). Gross production of Stages CIV and CV of C. acutus was similar, around 0.026 g C m(-2) d-1. These stages of C. acutus represent about 25% of the total copepod biomass around South Georgia, so total copepod production here may exceed that of krill by a factor of 4 during the productive summer months. Biomass of copepods and krill in other parts of the Southern Ocean differ by similar orders of magnitude, whilst growth rates are likely to remain within the range measured in this study. Therefore, our finding has relevance outside the local South Georgia system. All of the krill production is likely to be rapidly consumed by higher predators within the surface layers, whilst it is estimated that around 17% of copepod production may be sequestered at depth during winter diapause.																	0171-8630						2005	298						229	239		10.3354/meps298229								WOS:000231905600020						
J	Hirst, AG; Peterson, WT; Rothery, P				Hirst, AG; Peterson, WT; Rothery, P			Errors in juvenile copepod growth rate estimates are widespread: problems with the Moult Rate method	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The 'Moult Rate' (MR) method has been used widely to derive stage-specific growth rates in juvenile copepods. It is the most common field-based method. Unfortunately, the equation underlying the method is wrong and, consequently, large errors in juvenile growth rate estimates are widespread. The equation derives growth from the mean weight of 2 consecutive stages (i and i + 1) and the duration of stage i. The weight change and the period to which this change is attributed are, therefore, offset. We explore this potential source of error in the MR method critically. Errors arise as a result of 2 primary factors: (1) unequal durations of successive stages and (2) unequal rates of growth of successive stages. The method of deriving the mean weight (arithmetic or geometric) also has an impact and is examined. Using a steady-state assumption, a range of scenarios and the errors that arise are examined. The literature is then reviewed and the size of errors resulting from MR method application in both field and laboratory situations is estimated. Our results suggest that the MR method can lead to large errors in growth estimation in any stage, but some stages are particularly prone. Errors for the C5 stage are often large because the following stage (the adult) does not moult, and has a different rate of body weight increase. For the same reason, errors are also great where the following stage is not actively moulting (e.g. when diapausing). In these circumstances, published work has commonly greatly underestimated growth. For example, MR growth ranges from 11 to 47 % of the value derived correctly for this stage, g(i)_(corr) (calculated assuming the non-moulting stage does not grow). In late stages that are followed by actively moulting stages, the MR method has commonly given values in excess of 150% of g(i_corr) but underestimation also occurs, with values < 90 % of g(i_corr) We propose new methods and equations that overcome these problems. These equations are written with and without within-stage mortality included. The equations are relatively insensitive to mortality rates within the range found in the field, but only provided that the stage duration is not determined from moult rate. Stage duration estimates obtained from measuring moulting rates of field-collected animals are very sensitive to mortality rates of the animals prior to capture, and field mortality rates are often high enough to produce dramatic over-estimation of stage duration.

J	Niehoff, B; Hirche, HJ				Niehoff, B; Hirche, HJ			Reproduction of Calanus glacialis in the Lurefjord (western Norway): indication for temperature-induced female dormancy	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The reproductive activity of Calanus glacialis was studied during the winter-spring transition 1996 in the Lurefjord, western Norway, focussing on the impact of phytoplankton development and temperature. Depth-stratified samples were taken at weekly intervals to determine female abundance, vertical distribution and gonad development stage. Single live females were incubated to measure in situ egg production rate, clutch size and spawning frequency. These field observations were combined with feeding and starvation experiments to study the importance of food supply in greater detail. The depth distribution of the females changed during the investigation period. On February 28, most females were located between the surface and 100 m. During March, the majority of the females inhabited the upper 50 m, and by mid-April, most females had migrated to depths below 100 m. The reproductive activity of C. glacialis was uncoupled to the phytoplankton bloom. Females were already mature at the beginning of March and egg production began. Maximum reproduction was recorded on March 28 before the beginning of the spring bloom; thereafter, gonad maturity and egg production rates declined rapidly before the end of the bloom, and by April 11 the majority of females had migrated to depths >100 m. No faecal pellets were produced when these females were offered food, and gonads became equally depleted in females starving or feeding for 5 d, indicating a deep physiological change such as dormancy. The descent of the females to lower depths and the arrest of their reproductive activity were apparently related to a temperature increase in the surface layer, similar to earlier observations in the White Sea.

The objective is to integrate knowledge about the Impact of climate, agricultural technology, and soil on variability of the wheat yields in the Aegean region of Turkey. A data bank was established consisting of 140 wheat yields measurements (5 provinces x 28 years), daily and monthly climatic data, and the relevant independent input variables representing province physical conditions. The data batik also consisted of 298 experimental wheat plots (1970-1998) from the General Directorate of Rural Services Agricultural Experimental Institutes. The integration of the relationship between wheat yield and independent variables was achieved by using step-wise regression models, simulation of available soil-moisture from November to July for a period of 29 years (19701998), and re-analysis of 298 experimental results representing a range of climatic and management conditions. The results show that 80% of the inter-annual variability of the wheat yields is explained with a standard error of +/- 230 kg ha(-1). The most significant variables, which explained yield variability, are rainfall (during December, May and June), soil moisture stress (following the reproductive stage of wheat) in the province, and soils. Timely sowing of wheat (mid-November) seems to be critical. The available soil moisture in March can be used as a guide to determine the amount of nitrogen fertilizer application for wheat.																	0722-0723		3-923381-49-2				2005	36						123	132										WOS:000235640900013

J	Taylor, AH				Taylor, AH			Identifying forest reference conditions on early cut-over lands, Lake Tahoe Basin, USA	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Pre-Euro-American settlement forest structure and fire regimes for Jeffrey pine-white fir, red fir-western white pine, and lodgepole pine forests in the Lake Tahoe Basin (California and Nevada, USA) were identified using stand structural analysis and fire scars based on measurements of stumps of trees that were cut in the 19th century. Comparisons of the presettlement reference with contemporary conditions were then used to determine how and why contemporary conditions deviate from presettlement conditions and to guide ecological restoration. Contemporary forests varied in different ways compared to the presettlement reference. Contemporary Jeffrey pine-white fir forests have more and smaller trees, more basal area, less structural variability, and trees with a more clumped spatial distribution than presettlement forests. The mean presettlement fire-return interval for Jeffrey pine-white fir forests was 11.4 yr, and most (>90%) fires burned in the dormant season; no fire was recorded in the study area after 1871. Similar differences were identified in the structural characteristics of contemporary and presettlement red fir-western white pine and lodgepole pine forests. However, 19th-century logging changed the composition of red fir-western white pine forests, and these forests now have more lodgepole pine than red fir or western white pine. Comparison of contemporary forests with the presettlement reference suggests that restoration treatments in Jeffrey pine-white fir forests should include: (1) density and basal-area reduction, primarily of smaller diameter trees; (2) reintroduction of frequent fire as a key regulating disturbance process; and (3) increasing structural heterogeneity by shifting clumped tree distributions to a more random pattern. Restoration treatments in red fir-western white pine forests should include: (1) a shift in species composition by a density and basal-area reduction of lodgepole pine; and (2) increasing structural heterogeneity by shifting tree distributions to a more random pattern. In lodgepole pine forests the restoration emphasis should be: (1) a density and basal-area reduction of small-diameter trees; and (2) an increase in structural heterogeneity that shifts tree spatial patterns from clumped to a more random distribution. Reintroduction of fire as a regulating process into high-elevation red fir-western white pine and lodgepole pine forests can be viewed as a longer-term restoration goal. The method for quantifying presettlement reference conditions from stumps complements, or is an alternative to, methods based on dendroecology or repeat photography.																	1051-0761					DEC	2004	14	6					1903	1920		10.1890/02-5257								WOS:000225858000023

To supplement the population control tactics of the Areawide Pest Management Pro-rwn in Brookings, SD, geographic information systems were used front 1997 to 2001 to examine the spatial relationships between D. barberi population dynamics and habitat structure. soil texture and elevation. Using the inverse distance weighted interpolation technique, D. barberi population density maps were created from georeferenced emergence and postemergence traps placed in maize, Zea mays L. fields. For each year. these maps were overlaid with vegetation, soil, and elevation maps to search for quantitative relationships between pest numbers and landscape structure. Through visual interpretation and correlation analysis, shifts in landscape structure, such as size, number, and arrangement of patches were shown to associate with D. barberi population abundance and distribution in varying degrees. D. barberi were found in greater proportions than expected on lown mid silty clay lown soils and oil elevations between 500 and 509 in. An understanding of the interactions between D. barlwri popuation dynamics and landscape variables provides information to pest managers, which can be used to identify patterns in the landscape that promote high insect population density patches to improve 'pest management strategies.																	0022-0493					DEC	2004	97	6					1943	1957										WOS:000225907800023	15666749

These ticks transmit Theileria parva in cattle. In Africa. the body Size of R. appendiculatus increases with latitude while the body size of the morphologically similar Rhipicephalus zambeziensis is constant at two different latitudes. A larger body size is necessary once survival becomes a constraint. The most plausible explanation for the smaller R. appendiculatus in equatorial Africa is the cost to produce a larger egg. The consequences of these findings for the introduction of R. appendiculatus in new environments are discussed. New field observations from southern Zambia indicate that R. appendiculatus body size does not vary seasonally as compared to eastern Zambia. This is an additional indication of the presence of a single diapausing population of larger ticks.

(Acari: Ixodidae), as well as microclimate features of the site of study, are described for a 9-year-long study (1994-2002) in north-central Spain. According to drag captures, larvae had a unimodal activity pattern, with a maximum observed around July-August, whereas nymphs displayed a bimodal pattern (May-June and August-September) with strong dominance of spring activity. An inversion of this pattern, with larger autumn peak, was observed in years with humid summers. Adults showed a small spring peak and a large autumn one. In the later years of the study, a small increase in the adult spring peak of activity was noticed, correlated with mild winters. Over the entire period of study, a clear increase in the total tick abundance was detected. Statistically significant differences between years were observed for some climate variables (saturation deficit, winter temperatures and number of days with temperatures above 6degreesC), but a consistent and constant pattern of change was not observed in any climate variable. Temperature requirements for developing stages showed a sharp decrease in weeks 35-51 (eggs) and 38-50 (larvae and nymphs), a feature attributed to the presence of the morphogenetic diapause, beginning around September. Development rates obtained under quasi-natural conditions were almost twice those reported for other sites, suggesting an adaptation of this local, largely isolated I. ricinus population. According to drag captures and field-obtained development rates, interchange of nymphs between the two cohorts is common in this site, and seems to be influenced by the winter temperature and the date of larval engorgement.

Larval diapause of P. hilaris is induced under three diapause-inducing conditions (20degreesC-SD, 20degreesC-LD and 25degreesC-SD), and the diapause larvae are transferred to one of four conditions (20degreesC-SD, 20degreesC-LD, 25degreesC-SD or 25degreesC-LD) for observation of pupation, which indicates termination of diapause. The intensity of diapause induced under the three conditions increases in the order 20degreesC-SD<25&DEG;C-SD<20degreesC-LD, when assessed by the time course of pupation after the transfer. On the other hand, the effectiveness of the temperature-photoperiod combinations to terminate diapause is in the order 25degreesC-SD (ineffective)<<20degreesC-LD<25&DEG;C-LD<20degreesC-SD. Among the temperatures (5, 10, 15 and 20degreesC) examined, 15degreesC is the most effective in terminating diapause under the short day; diapause in most larvae appears to have been completed in 15 days.																	0307-6962					DEC	2004	29	5					458	463		10.1111/j.0307-6962.2004.00417.x								WOS:000225768000007

Vestigialization could proceed through the fixation of selectively neutral degenerative mutations via genetic drift. Alternatively, selection may facilitate vestigialization if trait loss results in enhanced fitness. We tested these hypotheses using Decodon verticillatus, a clonal plant in which sexual sterility has arisen repeatedly in populations across the northern geographical range limit. We compared growth and survival of replicated genotypes from 7 sexually fertile and 18 sterile populations, over 3 years in a common environment. Survival of sterile genotypes was 53% greater than for fertile genotypes, but there was no difference in biomass accumulation. Almost all mortality, and hence increased performance of sterile genotypes, occurred during simulated overwinter dormancy. These observations suggest that selection has facilitated the vestigialization of sex, and thus do not support the neutral mutation hypothesis. The selective mechanism probably involves the relaxation of a genetic trade-off between sexual reproduction and survival: alleles that increase vegetative performance at the expense of sexual fertility are selected in geographically peripheral populations where sexual reproduction is suppressed by adverse environmental conditions.																	0962-8452	1471-2954				NOV 22	2004	271	1555					2375	2380		10.1098/rspb.2004.2875								WOS:000225645500009	15556890

To test this assumption, and to verify whether changes in vegetation greenness are quantitative or qualitative, we experimentally warmed patches of High Arctic tundra with infrared heating in Northeast Greenland. By analyzing digital images of the vegetation, changes in cover were distinguished from changes in senescence. During the season, experimental warming significantly increased green cover, for example, at the time of peak cover, the total green cover was enhanced from 59.1 to 67.3%. The dominant wavelength (hue) reflected by our tundra plots shifted from yellow-green to yellow. Experimental warming with 2.5 degrees C delayed this hue-shift by 15 d. The results demonstrate that higher summer temperatures do not only promote plant growth at these latitudes but also retard and/or postpone the senescence process, contrary to indications from previous research that late-season phenology in the High Arctic is governed by photoperiod.																	1523-0430					NOV	2004	36	4					390	394		10.1657/1523-0430(2004)036[0390:CWPSIH]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000227702800002

Significant variation in photoperiodism between and within populations is thought to be associated with genetic variation resulting from local adaptation. In this study, we investigated whether genetic variation associated with selection for insecticide resistance may be a source of divergence in the photoperiodic timing of diapause through pleiotropic interactions. Critical photoperiods for diapause induction were estimated in one susceptible and two insecticide-resistant homozygous strains of the codling moth Cydia pomonella, as well as in their reciprocal F, progeny. Diapause responses to naturally decreasing day length were subsequently followed in the laboratory strains and in two field populations of C. pomonella in south-eastern France. We found higher critical photoperiods for diapause induction in homozygous resistant individuals than in both homozygous susceptible and heterozygous ones. This partly explained the significantly earlier timings of diapause found in homozygous resistant individuals of both laboratory and field populations of C. pomonella under natural photoperiods, relative to those found in both homozygous susceptible and heterozygous ones. We assume that adaptive genetic changes associated with selection for insecticide resistance may generate substantial variation in the seasonal timing of diapause, an essential ecological feature of the fitness of insecticide resistance genes in this species.

Despite this, the impact of transgenic pasture plants on native ecosystems remains relatively unstudied. Here we use a community gradient modelling approach to investigate the performance of subterranean clover containing a nutrition-enhancing transgene over a range of ecologically important grassland communities at a study site in south-eastern Australia. Our data, which were collected over a full annual growing season, show that the transgenic clover line has different seedling survival and seed dormancy breakdown rates than the commercial non-transgenic line, which suggests that transgenic populations will decline faster than non-transgenic ones in perennial native grassland communities but could, under optimal climatic conditions, have potentially higher growth rates in grazed annual grasslands. These results demonstrate that changes to ecologically important demographic parameters can occur in plants containing transgenes that are not typically considered fitness enhancing, and that genotype by environment interactions and management regimes that impact on these parameters may influence the invasiveness of transgenic plants. Our study also demonstrates the utility of incorporating plant community gradient modelling into ecological risk assessment protocols designed for transgenic pasture plants.

J	Caceres, CE; Tessier, AJ				Caceres, CE; Tessier, AJ			Incidence of diapause varies among populations of Daphnia pulicaria	OECOLOGIA												Dormancy is a common way in which organisms survive environmental conditions that would be lethal to the active individual. However, while dormant, individuals forgo reproduction. Hence theory suggests an optimal time in which to enter dormancy, depending on risks associated with both remaining active and entering dormancy. When these relative risks differ among habitats, dormancy strategies are predicted to vary as well. For freshwater zooplankton, it has been suggested that sensitivity to the cues that initiate dormancy should be selected against when females have the opportunity to remain in the water column year round. We tested this prediction with 12 populations of lake-dwelling Daphnia pulicaria (Crustacea: Cladocera). Differences among lakes in basin morphometry, predators and resources create a gradient of risk for Daphnia in the water column. Some populations persist in high numbers year round while others are abundant only in spring. We used this difference in persistence ability as an estimate of risk in the water-column. For 3-years of field sampling we found consistent differences among the lake populations in the incidence of dormancy. In some populations, only a small fraction of females switched to producing dormant eggs each year whereas in others the majority of eggs produced in the late spring were dormant. In general, populations that experienced predictably low abundances in the active form exhibited higher incidence of dormancy than did populations that persisted in high abundance year round, but there were exceptions. Our results confirm that the incidence of dormancy varies considerably among populations in a fashion consistent with general theory, but suggest that persistence in the water column is not the sole predictor of the diapause strategy found in any particular lake.																	0029-8549					NOV	2004	141	3					425	431		10.1007/s00442-004-1657-5								WOS:000224557300007	15375690					
J	Schleucher, E				Schleucher, E			Torpor in birds: Taxonomy, energetics, and ecology	PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL ZOOLOGY					6th International Congress of Comparative Physiology and Biochemistry	FEB 02-07, 2003	MT BULLER, AUSTRALIA					Recent reports on patterns and occurrence of torpor and other natural hypothermic states in birds have prompted a revision of many longstanding opinions. For instance, a larger assortment of birds covering a wider range of body mass than previously recognized uses energy-conserving mechanisms in the face of abundant food supplies. Thus, although acute energetic stress triggers the occurrence of hypometabolic states in many birds, energy deficits can no longer be regarded as the sole stimulus for avian torpor. Additionally, the phenology of this phenomenon ( phases, duration, depth) shows more interspecific variation than previously appreciated, and traditional concepts of the phases of torpor are not always adequate. Hence, inclusive definitions of torpor based on physiological and/or behavioral criteria have become more difficult to formulate. However, average nighttime body temperature, which is highly consistent throughout the class Aves (38.54degrees +/- 0.96degreesC, n = 202), provides a convenient reference for detecting natural hypothermic states. Of the putative ecological factors associated with avian torpor, food specialization seems a prime candidate as an ultimate factor in the occurrence of this state in birds. With few exceptions, all of these animals capable of torpor are either frugivorous, nectarivorous, or insectivorous, suggesting a correlation between thermoregulatory pattern and predictability of food supply. To date, no clear answer exists as to whether the variety of thermoregulatory patterns evident in birds involves discrete mechanisms or merely steps in a physiological continuum. However, I suggest that the occurrence of differences in torpor patterns among closely related species (e.g., within families) favors the latter interpretation.																	1522-2152					NOV-DEC	2004	77	6					942	949		10.1086/423744								WOS:000226862800008	15674768					
J	Kurota, H				Kurota, H			Overwintering strategies depending on high cold hardiness in nondiapause stages in Bruchidius dorsalis (Coleoptera : Bruchidae)	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												Bruchidius dorsalis Fahraeus (Coleoptera: Bruchidae) enters winter diapause in either the fourth (final) instar or during the adult stage (Kurota and Shimada 2001, 2003b). In the middle part of Japan, it overwinters in several developmental stages: nondiapausing young instars, diapausing instars, and adults (Kurota and Shimada 2002). TO understand the relationship between the complex overwintering stages and the adaptive diapause strategy of B. dorsalis, I investigated (1) overwintering survivorship in developmental stages observed in the field and (2) cold hardiness at all stages including nonoverwintering ones Such as eggs and pupae after enduring a controlled chilling experiment at 5degreesC for 100 d. The following results were obtained: (1) survivorship of nondiapausing larvae under natural conditions was almost as high as that of diapausing larvae and adults, and (2) cold hardiness in eggs and pupae was much lower than the other developmental stages in terms of survivorship and reproductive ability after the chilling treatment. From these results, I concluded that larval and adult diapause of this species would be induced at the most appropriate time to avoid overwintering in developmental stages with low cold hardiness. The complex overwintering stages in species that inhabit the middle part of Japan are likely to result from the adaptive timing of diapause induction at the two stages.

J	Gu, XY; Foley, ME; Chen, ZX				Gu, XY; Foley, ME; Chen, ZX			A set of three genes regulates photoperiodic responses of flowering in rice (Oryza sativa)	GENETICA												Differentiation in photoperiodic response of flowering has been key to the evolution and wide geographic distribution of rice, an essentially short-day plant. Crosses were made such that the hybrid F-1 plants flower later than the late-flowering parents to investigate the genetic basis underlying this differentiation. From initial experiments, three major genes for flowering time were identified from four naturally occurring variants under natural long-day conditions. An F-2-derived trigenic mutant line bred-true for a day-neutral response was selected and used as the recipient to synchronize the genetic background for the major genes. Experiments conducted under various daylengths indicated that these genes are responsible for photoperiodic sensitivity and the trihybrid has a critical daylength between 13.5 and 14 h. The three genes regulate photoperiodic responses qualitatively and quantitatively through complementary and other epistatic effects, respectively. The complementation suggests that the three genes act in a linear manner to repress the transition from the vegetative to reproductive phases under long daylengths. This set of genes also provides a model to understand the genetic mechanism underlying the elongated vegetative growth period in the F1 generation, which is usually an obstacle to the use of heterosis, and the selection for early maturation in rice breeding.																	0016-6707					OCT	2004	122	2					127	140		10.1023/B:GENE.0000041003.12834.41								WOS:000223771100003	15609572					
J	Brockmann, HJ				Brockmann, HJ			Variable life-history and emergence patterns of the pipe-organ mud-daubing wasp, Trypoxylon politum (Hymenoptera : Sphecidae)	JOURNAL OF THE KANSAS ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY												Many insect species show intraspecific variation in their life-history patterns. Such variability may affect a wide range of traits including size, social behavior, sex ratios, mating tactics, and competition for resources; it may also affect population dynamics and interactions with parasites and prey. Trypoxylon politum has a seasonally variable, partially bivoltine life history (i.e., some wasps produce offspring that emerge before the end of June whereas others produce overwintering offspring) in the southern part of its range and a univoltine life history (one generation per year) north of central Virginia. Wasps from three partially bivoltine populations differ in the pattern of adult emergence, suggesting a latitudinal gradient in their responsiveness to photoperiod and other environmental cues affecting diapause. Wasp size, sex, the date on which the egg was laid, and rearing conditions also affect diapause and the timing of adult emergence. Few behavioral differences were found between wasps from Florida partially bivoltine populations and wasps from New Jersey univoltine populations, but their life histories and patterns of adult emergence differ markedly. When wasps from partially bivoltine populations are reared in the north (NJ), they emerge at the same time as local wasps. When wasps from univoltine populations are subjected to warm winter conditions (FL) they show a bimodal pattern of adult emergence: some emerge slightly later than wasps from partially bivoltine populations reared under the same conditions whereas others emerge at the same time as those developing in the north. This suggests variability in the effect of environmental cues on diapause and adaptation to local environmental conditions. The advantages of different emergence patterns are discussed in terms of their effect in avoiding unfavorable conditions such as freezing, and in taking advantage of favorable conditions such as synchronizing emergence with the occurrence of appropriate prey resources.																	0022-8567					OCT	2004	77	4					503	527		10.2317/E43.1								WOS:000225775300015

An example to such rodent species is the Norwegian lemming Lemmus lemmus, which is distributed in northern Fermoscandia. We measured daily rhythms of heat production (VO2), body temperature (T-b), motor activity and melatonin secretion (measured from its metabolite 6-sulfatoximelatonin 6-SMT) in individuals exposed to natural day light.. Oulu Finland, in August 1997 and at a controlled ambient temperature of 22 degreesC. Our results show a daily rhythm Of VO2 with an acrophase at 04:00 h and minimal values measured at 16:00 h, with a significant difference (p < 0.001) between mean day and night values. 6-SMT also shows a daily rhythm with maximal secretion during the dark phase 24:00 and 06:00 h in which total 6-SMT values were 2.92 +/- 1.1 and 3.87 +/- 1.2 ng, respectively. The lowest values were recorded at 12:00 h; 0.86 +/- 0.63 ng. These results suggest that lemmings show a VO2 and melatonin daily rhythms, which seem to correlate with each other and it appears that melatonin secretion increases heat production.

J	Spiegel, M; Haim, A				Spiegel, M; Haim, A			Daily rhythms of nonshivering thermogenesis and responses to photoperiod manipulations in Apodemus mystacinus from two different ecosystems	JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY					International Thermal Physiology Symposium	OCT 10-15, 2004	Rhodes, GREECE					Comparative physiology is an important tool for understanding adaptation to environment. Regulatory nonshivering thermogenesis (NST) is an essential mechanism in small mammals for coping with low ambient temperatures. Because of its geographical location and its sharp climatic changes across short distances, Israel offers conducting comparative studies between different populations of the same species. The aims of this study were: (1) to compare NST-capacity daily rhythms, between the two populations of the broad-toothed field mouse Apodemus Mystacinus-that of Mount Carmel (Mediterranean) and that of Mount Hermon (Subalpinic), (2) to compare the thermoregulatory daily rhythms response to photoperiod manipulations of mice from the two populations. Mice were acclimated for at least 3 weeks to long scotophase (1613: 8L-LS) and then to long photophase (16L:8D-LP) at a constant ambient temperature (T-a) of 24 +/- 1 degreesC. The following variables were compared at four different times of the day (06, 12, 18, 24 h): minimal body temperature (T(b)Min), minimal oxygen consumption (VO(2)Min) measured at the lower critical point and their response to noradrenaline (NA), 1.5 mg/1 kg. W-b injected s.c., (VO(2)NA and T(b)NA). NST-capacity was calculated as the ratio between VO(2)NA and VO(2)Min. The measurements were carried out at T-a of 28 degreesC and in light conditions matching those of acclimation. NA was injected after establishing VO(2)Min and T(b)Min. The values mean +/- SD are given for each measurement for n = 6. A three-way ANOVA revealed a significant difference between the two populations. Significant differences were revealed at different hours within populations under the different photoperiod regimes for different measured variables. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Musolin, DL; Tsytsulina, K; Ito, K				Musolin, DL; Tsytsulina, K; Ito, K			Photoperiodic and temperature control of reproductive diapause induction in the predatory bug Orius strigicollis (Heteroptera : Anthocoridae) and its implications for biological control	BIOLOGICAL CONTROL												The effect of day-length and temperature on the duration of the egg to adult period and reproductive diapause in Orius strigicollis (Poppius) (Heteroptera: Anthocoridae) from central Japan (36degreesN; 140degreesE) was studied in the laboratory. At 20 degreesC, the egg to adult period tended to increase with lengthening of photoperiod from short day [10:14 (L:D) h] to long day [14:10 (L:D) h], but slightly decreased with further lengthening of photoperiod, whereas at 24 degreesC, an opposite trend was recorded. At 28 degreesC, the developmental period was much shorter and there were no obvious trends. It is assumed that photoperiod-mediated acceleration of nymphal growth takes place in autumn when ambient temperature and natural day-length are decreasing, thus promoting earlier emergence of adults prior to the deterioration of environmental conditions. The species showed a long-day photoperiodic response of reproductive diapause induction: at 20 and 24 degreesC, 83-100% females entered diapause under short-day conditions [10:14 (L:D), 11:13 (L:D), and 12:12 (L:D) h], whereas 82-91% of females were reproductive under long-day conditions [14:10 (L:D), 15:9 (L:D), and 16:8 (L:D) h]. The critical day-length was close to 13h at 20 degreesC and to 12.5h at 24 degreesC. Diapause induction was strongly suppressed at 28 degreesC: its incidence did not exceed 50% even at 10: 14 (L:D) h. It is estimated that O. strigieollis produces four or five generations in central Japan. The seasonal cycle and tendency to enter diapause are compared with other Orius species and other geographical populations of O. strigicollis. Implications of diapause-related traits for biological control are discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Fifty percent of individuals of Modicogryllus frontalis reared at 28degreesC reached adulthood in approximately 80 days in conditions of 11 h light: 13 h dark (LD 11:13) to 14:10, and in approximately 95 days under LD 15:9 to 16:8. Melanogryllus desertus started adult emergence earliest under LD 16:8 at 28degreesC, but some individuals required much longer to mature, and thus two peaks of adult emergence occurred at approximately 60 and 160 days after hatching. More individuals hatched during the late peak in LD 18:6 than in LID 16:8. The mean nymphal period was approximately 100 days in LD 11:13 to 14:10. Both species showed short-day type photoperiodic responses, but Mo. frontalis developed faster than did Me. desertus. The latter occupied a wider range of habitat conditions and was more variable in life cycle than the former. Modicogryllus burdigalensis started adult emergence earliest in LD 16:8 at 28degreesC in the six photoperiods tested, most adults emerging within 60 days. The mean nymphal period was 80 days in LID 15:9, 135 days in LD 14:10 and 80-100 days in LD 11:13 to 13:11, showing an intermediate type of photoperiodic response. Acheta domesticus was a long-day type species, and the proportion of delayed individuals increased with decreasing photoperiod. In the dry climate of Xinjiang-Uygur, nymphal overwintering seems to be successful in all of the four different patterns of nymphal development.																	1343-8786	1479-8298				SEP	2004	7	3					237	244		10.1111/j.1479-8298.2004.00069.x								WOS:000227357400007

Location The four TDFs in Guanacaste (Costa Rica), Yucatan, Jalisco and Sonora (Mexico) are characterized by a 5-7 month long dry season and are located along a gradient of increasing latitude (10-30degreesN). Methods To dissect the differences in flowering periodicity observed at the community level, individual tree species were assigned to 'flowering types', i.e. groups of species with characteristic flowering periods determined by similar combinations of environmental flowering cues and vegetative phenology. Results Large variation in the fraction of species and flowering types blooming during the dry and wet season, respectively, indicates large differences in the severity of seasonal drought among the four forests. In the dry upland forests of Jalisco, flowering of leafless trees remains suppressed during severe seasonal drought and is triggered by the first rains of the wet season. In the other forests, leaf shedding, exceptional rainfall or increasing daylength cause flowering of many deciduous species at various times during the dry season, well before the summer rains. The fraction of deciduous species leafing out during the summer rains and flowering when leafless during the dry season is largest in the Sonoran TDF. Main conclusions In many wide-ranging species the phenotypic plasticity of flowering periodicity is large. The distinct temporal separation of spring flowering on leafless shoots and subsequent summer flushing represents a unique adaptation of tree development to climates with a relatively short rainy season and a long dry season. Seasonal variation in rainfall and soil water availability apparently constitutes not only the proximate, but also the ultimate cause of flowering periodicity, which is unlikely to have evolved in response to biotic adaptive pressures.

J	Lawrence, AJ; Soame, JM				Lawrence, AJ; Soame, JM			The effects of climate change on the reproduction of coastal invertebrates	IBIS												Environmental cues control or synchronize the reproductive cycle of many marine invertebrates. Of these environmental cues, photoperiod and temperature have been shown to moderate reproduction either individually or in combination. In addition, they may act directly or, in the case of photoperiod, set circannual clock mechanisms. These environmental cues may affect a number of reproductive parameters, including sex determination, gametogenesis and spawning. Gonadotrophic and spawning hormones appear to act as the transducers between the environment and the gamete, and limited evidence indicates that temperature and photoperiod can alter levels of these. Such processes occur in a range of estuarine invertebrates that constitute important components of the diets of overwintering birds. Global warming is likely to uncouple and alter the phase relationship between temperature and photoperiod and this is likely to have significant consequences for animals that develop gametes during the winter and spawn in the spring in temperate northern latitudes. Species that cue reproduction to photoperiod are likely to be particularly vulnerable. Although this is unlikely to lead to extinctions, it may cause local extirpations. However, this will depend on speed of adaptation to changing climate in relation to speed of climate change and the degree of mixing between populations across the range of the species. More likely will be significant impacts on fecundity, spawning success and recruitment, and this may have significant implications for overwintering birds of national and international importance, and, ultimately, on the conservation status of estuaries such as the Humber in the UK.																	0019-1019					SEP	2004	146			1			29	39		10.1111/j.1474-919X.2004.00325.x								WOS:000224166900007

Thus far, the scientific literature has not adequately addressed the effects of livestock grazing on riparian areas in the American southwest. Most available information is observational, anecdotal, based on unreplicated experiments, or compares heavily grazed areas to areas from which livestock have been completely excluded. This study, in the Black Range of western New Mexico, compared effects of different seasons of use (cool season, warm season, and dormant season) and grazing intensities (light, moderate, and none) of cattle on young narrowleaf cottonwood (Populus angustifolia James) populations, and herbaceous vegetation in 2 adjacent southwestern riparian areas. Cottonwoods in lightly grazed and moderately grazed plots received significantly greater use than cottonwoods in ungrazed plots which experienced negligible grazing pressure. Increased grazing pressure did not have significant impacts on cottonwood populations. Effects of season of use were significant on both herbaceous species richness and diversity. We conclude that no single riparian area management approach is best in all situations, but the grazing treatments used in this study appear to have been successful at maintaining riparian communities.																	0022-409X					SEP	2004	57	5					466	474		10.2307/4003975								WOS:000223962200006

Regarding availability of propagules, central Chile matorral presents the Communities with the greatest incidence of naturalized herbs, followed by the sclerophyllous forest and the espinal scrubland in the coastal range. In contrast, north-central communities have lower numbers and proportions of naturalized species of herbs in their seed banks. Availability and persistence of naturalized herbs do not differ between aboveground vegetation and seed bank. Regarding attributes of local communities associated with the establishment and the spread of exotics, grazing regime and land use emerge as the most prominent causes that render them more prone to invasion by exotics. Evidence on the effect of the fire regime is contradictory and native species richness does not seem to be an important factor. Regarding attributes of exotic species seeds, results Suggest that naturalized annuals germinate within a wide temperature range, are highly resistant to cold and dry conditions, and show some degree of physiological dormancy. Additionally, naturalized annuals are highly tolerant to poor soils, but are generally intolerant to shade. These general attributes have largely determined the invasion process in the mediterranean region of Chile. Historical data indicate that an important number of exotic species were intentionally introduced, and that the spread of exotic is uncontrolled. It has been demonstrated that arrival time of exotics is of great relevance to understand present day spread of exotics in Chile, independent of their biogeographic origin. Exotic species may cause strong disruptions of ecosystem processes and functions in Chile, as exemplified by exotic tree plantations, which have altered soil chemistry, nutrient cycling, water cycle, hydrology, microclimate, and fire frequency and intensity.				jaksic, Fabian/G-1705-2014; Marquet, Pablo/B-7732-2009	Marquet, Pablo/0000-0001-6369-9339												0716-078X					SEP	2004	77	3					465	483										WOS:000224114200006

Limits to the potential range exist in the southern United States because of limits to diapause development, and in northern Canada because of slower prediapause and larval development. A 1.5 degreesC increase in mean daily maximum and minimum temperatures, as might occur with global climate change, would result in a range expansion in the north, a range contraction in the south, and a net increase in range of approximately 16%. The model is described and the probable limitations to establishment are discussed. Crown Copyright (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Grover, JP; Chrzanowski, TH				Grover, JP; Chrzanowski, TH			Limiting resources, disturbance, and diversity in phytoplankton communities	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												Phytoplankton diversity, limiting resources, and disturbance were studied in two reservoirs, Eagle Mountain Lake (EML) and Joe Pool Lake (JPL), in north Texas, USA, for three summer growing seasons and two winters. Availabilities of phosphorus, nitrogen, and silicon were measured as chemical concentrations, and availability of light was measured as irradiance during the photoperiod, averaged over the depth of the surface mixed layer. A resource was defined as limiting whenever its availability fell below a threshold, treated as a parameter to be fitted. Depth of the surface mixed layer and wind speed were taken as indices of disturbance associated with episodic mixing. Hydrological disturbance was gauged by rainfall, inflow, and the variation of lake level. We found that diversity was strongly and significantly correlated with the number of limiting resources in one lake (JPL), but not the other (EML). The onset of nitrogen and phosphorus limitation during the summer growing season is associated with increased phytoplankton diversity in JPL. Regression modeling detected decreasing relationships between diversity and disturbance indices in one lake (JPL), but concave-down relationships in the other (EML), though the peaks of these relationships did not lie within the usual range of disturbance. Predictive regressions for diversity incorporating both limiting resources and disturbance were partitioned into unique and shared effects of these factors. There was a large unique effect of the number of limiting resources in JPL, but otherwise the shared effects were large relative to unique effects.																	0012-9615					AUG	2004	74	3					533	551		10.1890/03-4073								WOS:000223455600007						
J	Bradshaw, WE; Zani, PA; Holzapfel, CM				Bradshaw, WE; Zani, PA; Holzapfel, CM			Adaptation to temperate climates	EVOLUTION												Only model organisms live in a world of endless summer. Fitness at temperate latitudes reflects the ability of organisms in nature to exploit the favorable season, to mitigate the effects of the unfavorable season, and to make the timely switch from one life style to the other. Herein, we define fitness as Ry, the year-long cohort replacement rate across all four seasons, of the mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii, reared in its natural microhabitat in processor-controlled environment rooms. First, we exposed cohorts of W. smithii, from southern, midlatitude, and northern populations (30-50degreesN) to southern and northern thermal years during which we factored out evolved differences in photoperiodic response. We found clear evidence of evolved differences in heat and cold tolerance among populations. Relative cold tolerance of northern populations became apparent when populations were stressed to the brink of extinction; relative heat tolerance of southern populations became apparent when the adverse effects of heat could accumulate over several generations. Second, we exposed southern, midlatitude, and northern populations to natural, midlatitude day lengths in a thermally benign midlatitude thermal year. We found that evolved differences in photoperiodic response (1) prevented the timely entry of southern populations into diapause resulting in a 74% decline in fitness, and (2) forced northern populations to endure a warm-season diapause resulting in an 88% decline in fitness. We argue that reciprocal transplants across latitudes in nature always confound the effects of the thermal and photic environment on fitness. Yet, to our knowledge, no one has previously held the thermal year constant while varying the photic year. This distinction is crucial in evaluating the potential impact of climate change. Because global warming in the Northern Hemisphere is proceeding faster at northern than at southern latitudes and because this change represents an amelioration of the thermal environment and a concomitant increase in the duration of the growing season, we conclude that there should be more rapid evolution of photoperiodic response than of thermal tolerance as a consequence of global warming among northern, temperate ectotherms.																	0014-3820	1558-5646				AUG	2004	58	8					1748	1762										WOS:000223583900009	15446427					
J	Kimura, MT				Kimura, MT			Cold and heat tolerance of drosophilid flies with reference to their latitudinal distributions	OECOLOGIA												The relation between thermal tolerance and latitudinal distribution was studied with 30 drosophilid species collected from the cool-temperate region (Sapporo), the warm-temperate region (Tokyo and Kyoto) and the subtropical region (Iriomote island) in Japan. In addition, intraspecific variation was examined for five species collected from two localities. The subtropical strains of Scaptodrosophila coracina, Drosophila bizonata and D. daruma were less tolerant to cold than their temperate strains. However, the difference of cold tolerance between these two geographic strains was much smaller than the difference between the species restricted to the subtropical region and those occurring in the temperate region. In D. auraria and D. suzukii, no difference was observed in thermal tolerance between their cool- and warm-temperate strains. Thus, geographic variation in thermal tolerance within species was low or negligible. Interspecific comparisons by phylogenetic independent contrasts revealed that species which had the northern boundaries of their distributions at higher latitudes were generally more tolerant to cold than those which had their boundaries at lower latitudes. However, the data for some species did not agree with this trend. The use of man-protected warm places for overwintering, competition or predation would also affect their distributions. It also appeared that species which had their southern boundaries at higher latitudes were generally more cold-tolerant. The acquisition of cold tolerance may lower a fly's capacity to compete, survive or reproduce in warmer climates. On the other hand, no relation was observed between heat tolerance and latitudinal distribution. Heat tolerance was higher in species inhabiting openlands or the forest canopy than in those inhabiting the forest understorey.																	0029-8549					AUG	2004	140	3					442	449		10.1007/s00442-004-1605-4								WOS:000223008700008	15221433

STUDIES ON NEOTROPICAL FAUNA AND ENVIRONMENT												Cornops aquaticum (Brunei) is host specific on Eichhornia spp. and Pontederia spp. (Pontederiacae). Its present distribution ranges from Mexico to Argentina. The number of juvenile instars (5-7) apparently mirrors the photoperiod and temperature pulses of different climatical conditions in the respective geographical regions. Based on life-history data, three working hypotheses are proposed for forthcoming studies. These will test whether the varying number of juvenile instars represents a phenotypic plasticity of a single genotype or an adaptation that is genetically fixed, due to an evolutionary relationship of the host with its host-plant.

J	Blanckenhorn, WU; Heyland, A				Blanckenhorn, WU; Heyland, A			The quantitative genetics of two life history trade-offs in the yellow dung fly in abundant and limited food environments	EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY												The trade-offs between body size and development time and between egg size and egg number ( clutch size) are central to life history theory, but evidence for them, particularly in terms of genetic correlations, is equivocal. For the yellow dung fly Scathophaga stercoraria ( Diptera: Scathophagidae), we investigated variation in phenotypic and genetic variances and covariances, i.e. heritabilities and genetic correlations, of these life history traits ( plus diapause) in benign and stressful larval field or adult laboratory food environments. We found both trade-offs to be weak, as evidenced by low phenotypic and genetic correlations, but stronger in the food limited environments. Broad sense heritabilities were generally significant for all traits considered, whereas the narrow sense heritabilities for egg and clutch size were nil. With regard to the question of how environmental stress affects heritabilities, we found a whole range of responses within one single species depending on the traits considered. All three possible patterns occurred, i.e. increased h(2) due to increased V-G or decreased V-P, decreased h(2) due to increased V-P, and no change in h(2) due to increased V-G and V-P. These can be explained by the particular ecological circumstances yellow dung flies face in their natural environment. Nevertheless, the majority of patterns was consistent with the idea that stressful conditions amplify phenotypic differences between genotypes. Such variable responses of traits even within one organism underscores the complexity of this issue and may well explain the multiple patterns found in various organisms.

J	Zhang, XY; Friedl, MA; Schaaf, CB; Strahler, AH				Zhang, XY; Friedl, MA; Schaaf, CB; Strahler, AH			Climate controls on vegetation phenological patterns in northern mid- and high latitudes inferred from MODIS data	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Recent studies using both field measurements and satellite-derived-vegetation indices have demonstrated that global warming is influencing vegetation growth and phenology. To accurately predict the future response of vegetation to climate variation, a thorough understanding of vegetation phenological cycles and their relationship to temperature and precipitation is required. In this paper, vegetation phenological transition dates identified using data from the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) in 2001 are linked with MODIS land surface temperature (LST) data from the northern hemisphere between 35degreesN and 70degreesN. The results show well-defined patterns dependent on latitude, in which vegetation greenup gradually migrates northward starting in March, and dormancy spreads southward from late September. Among natural vegetation land-cover types, the growing-season length for forests is strongly correlated with variation in mean annual LST. For urban areas, the onset of greenup is 4-9 days earlier on average, and the onset of dormancy is about 2-16 days later, relative to adjacent natural vegetation. This difference (especially for urban vs. forests) is apparently related to urban heat island effects that result in both the average spring temperature and the mean annual temperature in urban areas being about 1-3degreesC higher relative to rural areas. The results also indicate that urban heat island effects on vegetation phenology are stronger in North America than in Europe and Asia. Finally, the onset of forest greenup at continental scales can be effectively described using a thermal time-chilling model, which can be used to infer the delay or advance of greenup onset in relation to climatic warming at global scale.

J	Dahms, HU; Qian, PY				Dahms, HU; Qian, PY			Life histories of the Harpacticoida (Copepoda, Crustacea): a comparison with meiofauna and macrofauna	JOURNAL OF NATURAL HISTORY												The Harpacticoida reside in a wide range of habitats--from all marine situations to most freshwater habitats, and even moist terrestrial substrata like moss and litter. They exhibit free-living to parasitic life-styles and larval development with plankto- and lecithotrophy. Harpacticoid life cycles as a rule comprise six nauplius larvae and six copepodids, the sixth being the adult. Harpacticoid life history traits known from the field or from cohort analyses include differential fecundity, stage duration and survival, sex ratio, development and life span. Understanding life history traits, i.e. assessing the importance of various biotic and abiotic factors in regulating life cycle patterns, is essential for the interpretation of seasonal variations of population size. Evolutionary stable strategies (EES) of reproductive resource allocation and timing are determined by trade-offs between environmental conditions as well as by intrinsic factors. The latter are the genetic base, depending on the evolutionary history and relatedness of the taxa under consideration which determine their phenotypic plasticity. Most interesting are ontogenetic niche shifts, especially in habitat, food and stage duration, including dormancy phenomena. Harpacticoid life history traits will be discussed in the light of meio- and macrofauna life cycles in general. It seems as if small meiofaunal taxa are not able to proliferate pelagic larvae of sufficient quantity, because larvae need a certain size to become functional. Instead, meiofaunal taxa switch to a trait of direct development and even brood care in some cases. It is hypothesized that the Harpacticoida are the only meiofaunal taxa to develop larval stages because their nauplii share the same habitat as the adults and no risky habitat transition will occur as in the pelagic larvae of the macrofauna.																	0022-2933					JUL	2004	38	14					1725	1734		10.1080/0022293031000156321								WOS:000186929300001

Other (supplementary) environmental cues, such as temperature and precipitation, were historically thought to play unimportant roles in reproductive timing. We demonstrate variation in reproductive timing across small geographic distances by examining the vernal testicular recrudescence of adult song sparrows (Melospiza melodia morphna) breeding in coastal (0-10 in elevation) and montane (280-1220 in elevation) habitats. Each year, these birds experienced the same photoperiod, but were exposed to different supplementary cues that varied with altitude. Coastal birds experienced warmer and more stable temperatures during late winter and early spring than did montane birds. We measured bud opening, emergence of new green shoots, and arthropod biomass to monitor the pace of spring's approach. New spring shoots emerged 2 months earlier on the coast than in the mountains and buds on flowering trees and shrubs also tended to open earlier at the coast. Arthropod biomass was similar in both the mountains and the coast during early spring, and began to increase in early summer. Reproductive morphology (i.e. testis volume and cloacal protuberance length) developed up to 2 months earlier on the coast than in the mountains. Testicular recrudescence occurred earlier on the coast in most years and proceeded at a faster rate in I year. Circulating levels of luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone and prolactin increased through the season, but did not correlate with differences between sites. Both populations responded similarly when exposed to identical photoperiodic cues in the laboratory. Therefore, we suggest that an integrated response to cues characteristic of location and elevation account for differences in patterns measured in the field.

J	Misra, M; Rani, S; Singh, S; Kumar, V				Misra, M; Rani, S; Singh, S; Kumar, V			Regulation of seasonality in the migratory male blackheaded bunting (Emberiza melanocephala)	REPRODUCTION NUTRITION DEVELOPMENT												The present study was carried out on a Palearctic-Indian migratory species, the blackheaded bunting (Emberiza melanocephala), to understand the importance of photoperiodism and circannual rhythms in determining seasonality in changes in body mass and testis size in birds. An initial experiment determined the effects of duration and intensity of light on photoperiodic induction. The birds were exposed to different photoperiods (hours of light: hours of darkness; 11.5L: 12.5D, 12L:12D, 12.5L:11.5D and 13L:11D) at the same (similar to450 lux) light intensity, and to 13L: 11D at different light intensities (50-, 100-, 400-, 800- and 1000-lux). The induction and subsequent regression of photoperiodic responses were dependent upon duration and intensity of the light period until these reached threshold. A second experiment investigated if an endogenous seasonal rhythm underlies photoperiodism in buntings. Birds maintained since February on a 8L:16D photoperiod (a non-inductive short day length invariably used to ensure photosensitivity in photoperiodic species) were subjected periodically to 16L:8D (a long day length), one group every month from mid-March to mid-August. The magnitude of long day response in body mass and testes decreased as the duration of the short days progressed, but testicular response was restored in birds that were exposed to long days in July and August. The birds exposed simultaneously to short, long, and natural day lengths for 32 weeks underwent an induction-regression cycle under long days and natural day lengths, but not under short days in which a decrease in body mass occurred after about 20 weeks. The last experiment examined the importance of latitudinal migration on photoperiodism, by comparing the response to long days of three groups which included birds from populations those were held in the outdoor aviary for 1 or 2 years at 27degreesN and those immediately arrived from their breeding grounds (similar to40degreesN). There was no difference in the photoperiodic induction among the three groups, indicating that neither experience to changing photoperiods during a migratory journey, nor to long photoperiods at breeding grounds, were critical for a subsequent response (initiation-termination-reinitiation) cycle. Taken together, these findings suggest that (1) the blackheaded bunting has its own endogenous timing program, which is regulated by the photoperiod, and (2) the photoperiodic programs of bunting are flexible enough to accommodate variations in the amplitude of environmental cycles. Thus, it appears that photoperiodism has evolved independently of the evolution of migration in this species.																	0926-5287					JUL-AUG	2004	44	4					341	352		10.1051/rnd:2004039								WOS:000224957300005	15535466					
J	Styrsky, JD; Berthold, P; Robinson, WD				Styrsky, JD; Berthold, P; Robinson, WD			Endogenous control of migration and calendar effects in an intratropical migrant, the yellow-green vireo	ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR												Endogenous circannual rhythms control the time course for moult, migratory fattening and autumn Migration in juveniles of several bird species that breed in the temperate zone. Exogenous factors, such as daylength, can also exert a measure of control: photoperiodic cues detected by birds that hatch late in the season induce accelerated juvenile development, assuring that late-hatched young migrate at the same time as early-hatched young. Whether these same mechanisms of control also apply to birds that migrate between breeding and nonbreeding areas entirely within the tropics at latitudes characterized by little seasonal variation in photoperiod is unknown. We conducted a common-garden experiment in Panama (9degreesN) in which we hand-reared wild-caught nestling yellow-green vireos, Vireo flavoviridis, under a constant photoperiod and monitored them for the expression of juvenile moult, migratory fattening and migratory activity. Even in the absence of a seasonal photoperiodic cue, juveniles moulted, accumulated fat reserves and initiated migratory activity, suggesting endogenous control of these processes. Age at the onset of moult, migratory fattening and migratory activity were each significantly negatively correlated with hatch date, however, so that the expression of these three processes was synchronized among juveniles with respect to the time of the season. We suggest that the slight differences in daylength perceived either by the nestlings themselves in the short time before they were collected (at 6-8 days of age) or by the adult females during egg production influenced rate of nestling development, thus allowing later-hatched young to moult, accumulate fat and migrate at a younger age than early-hatched young. Remarkably, photoperiod differed between the earliest and latest hatch dates in this study by only 33 min. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Fargallo, JA				Fargallo, JA			Latitudinal trends of reproductive traits in the blue tit Parus caeruleus	ARDEOLA												Aims: Geographical variation in laying date, clutch size and proportion of second clutches was studied in the Blue Tit Parus caeruleus in order to test current predictions about latitudinal trends of these reproductive traits. The effects of latitude, altitude, habitat type (deciduous, evergreen and mixed) and year of study were taken into account. Location: Data were obtained from 87 populations of the western Palaearctic along a latitudinal range of 27 degrees (33 to 60degreesN). Methods: General Linear Models (GLM) were performed on mean laying date, clutch size and proportion of second clutches of Blue Tit populations. Habitat type was included as a factor and the rest of variables as co-variates. Results: Laying date was later in evergreen than in deciduous habitats, was positively correlated with altitude and showed a quadratic relationship with latitude. Blue Tits laid smaller clutch sizes in evergreen habitats compared with mixed or deciduous habitats. Clutch size was negatively correlated with altitude. The variation of clutch size on latitude was curvilinear. The proportion of second clutches was higher in mixed and deciduous than in evergreen habitats and its variation along the latitudinal cline also was better fitted to a quadratic than to a linear model. Conclusions: The latitudinal variation found in all these life history traits can not be only explained by classical hypotheses about latitudinal reproductive variation. As recent studies have shown, factors other than day-length, seasonality of resources and predation appear to operate in the determination of the reproductive parameters of passerine birds in a geographic context. Mixed forests appear to be the habitat where Blue Tits are more productive (large clutch sizes and high proportion of second breeding attempts). Habitat quality associated with the position (peripheral and central) of the distribution of a bird species in combination with other factors, namely ambient temperature and energy requirements, probably contribute to explain the curvilinear pattern found in reproductive traits of this species.

To separate the effects of habitat quality from those of genetics, we reared imagos from all field populations in a common garden experiment until the emergence of the third-instar larvae. The local climate appeared to determine the cold hardiness of the third-instar larvae, which live exclusively in cold seasons. The geographical location had an effect on the frost resistance (supercooling point) of the third-instar larvae of G. variabilis. We found no significant differences between the supercooling points of the populations originating from separate latitudes but from the same longitude, Sare (-10.9 +/- 4.1 degreesC) and Husson (-11.5 +/- 3.8 degreesC). Nonetheless, significant differences occurred between the larvae originating from the same northern latitude but from separate longitudes, Husson and La Robertsau (-17.8 +/- 2.9 degreesC). It is the first time that a highly significant difference in the supercooling point of one stage within a single species has been observed along geographical gradients. Moreover, 19 of the 24 larvae originating from La Robertsau were alive after they were kept for 22 h at -10 degreesC compared with only 7 of the 24 larvae originating from Sare. When the three populations were reared in the laboratory under the same experimental conditions, the differential cryoresistance was preserved. It is likely that the greater freezing resistance found in the third-instar larvae of G. variabilis from La Robertsau could have a genetic component.

J	Grissino-Mayer, HD; Romme, WH; Floyd, ML; Hanna, DD				Grissino-Mayer, HD; Romme, WH; Floyd, ML; Hanna, DD			Climatic and human influences on fire regimes of the southern San Juan Mountains, Colorado, USA	ECOLOGY												Fire severity, frequency, and extent are expected to change dramatically in coming decades in response to changing climatic conditions, superimposed on the adverse cumulative effects of various human-related disturbances on ecosystems during the past 100 years or more. To better gauge these expected changes, knowledge of climatic and human influences on past fire regimes is essential. We characterized the temporal and spatial properties of fire regimes in ponderosa pine forests of the southern San Juan Mountains of southwestern Colorado by collecting 175 fire-scarred tree samples from nine sites across a wide range of topographic settings. All tree rings and fire scars were dated using standard dendrochronological techniques. Fire-free intervals were statistically modeled using the Weibull distribution to provide quantitative measures that characterized the historical range of variation in pre-EuroAmerican fire regimes. Fires during our reference period were more frequent in the low elevation ponderosa pine forests (6-10 yr) than in the high elevation, mixed conifer forests (18 28 yr). Fires at lower elevations were predominantly low-severity, isolated fires. Fires during some years (e.g., 1748) were spatially extensive throughout the entire mountain range. Intervals that delimited significantly long fire-free periods ranged from 10-19 yr (low elevation) to 2750 yr (high elevation). Fire histories were similar between the eastern and western portions of the mountain range, although we found significant evidence of topographic isolation on fire regimes at one site. Pre-1880 fires primarily occurred in the dormant season, and we found no temporal changes in past fire seasonality. We found no compelling evidence that Native Americans influenced fire regimes in our study sites. We found a hiatus in fire occurrence between 1750 and 1770 that we believe was likely related to weakened El Nino-Southern Oscillation activity, an extended series of cool-phase Pacific Decadal Oscillation events, and weakened monsoonal moisture, all possibly entrained in an invasive air mass typical of locations that are more northerly. In addition, pre-1880 fires occurred during years of severe drought, conditioned by above average moisture conditions in preceding years. The 20th century is characterized by a near complete absence of fires (fire-free interval of >100 yr), suggesting future wildfires may be more widespread and ecologically severe compared to pre-1880 fires.

J	Wang, R; Bai, Y; Tanino, K				Wang, R; Bai, Y; Tanino, K			Effect of seed size and sub-zero imbibition-temperature on the thermal time model of winterfat (Eurotia lanata (Pursh) Moq.)	ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY												Thermal time has been widely used to quantify and model seed germination. However, several assumptions in the thermal time model remain untested. The purpose of this study was to test variations in parameters of the thermal time model among seed size classes and sub-zero imbibition-temperature treatments using two non-dormant seed collections of winterfat (Eurotia lanata). Seeds originating from Utah, USA, were imbibed at sub-zero temperature for 0, 1, 3 and 5 days and then were germinated at 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 degreesC. Estimated base temperature (T(b)) was lower in the large seed class (-4.48 degreesC) than the small seed class (-3.53 degreesC). Thermal time for 50% germination (theta(T(50))) and the standard deviation of thermal times (sigma(thetaT)) were not significantly different between seed collections and seed size classes. Seeds germinated faster after imbibition at sub-zero temperature, but the enhanced germination rate was mainly attributed to thermal time accumulation during imbibition rather than the often speculated physiological changes. A thermal germination rate index (TGRI) was proposed, which successfully accounted for the thermal time accumulation during imbibition. Sub-zero imbibition-temperature treatments did, however, alter T(b), theta(T(50)) and sigma(thetaT), for both collections and seed size classes as evidenced by the higher model fit of the modified model than the original model. Base temperature in the thermal time model of winterfat was lower for larger seeds, which enables large seeds to accumulate more thermal time at a given temperature. This is particularly important for species such as winterfat because seeds of this species germinate early in the season. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Bears did not arouse from torpor throughout the winter test period. Abdominal temperature remained within a 1.5degreesC temperature range and did not appear to exhibit circadian rhythmicity. However, neck surface temperature of bears demonstrated elevated spikes from 2 to 30degreesC about 4 times each day. Adult students wearing the same neck sensors as bears exhibited similar spikes in body surface temperature when vigorously exercising in the cold. We suggest that bears engage in bouts of muscle activity during the winter denning period that may result in the retention of muscle strength without elevating their core body temperature and without arousing from torpor.																	0022-2372					JUN	2004	85	3					414	419		10.1644/1545-1542(2004)085<0414:BSTOHB>2.0.CO;2								WOS:000221896600006						
J	Fantinou, AA; Perdikis, DC; Zota, KF				Fantinou, AA; Perdikis, DC; Zota, KF			Reproductive responses to photoperiod and temperature by diapausing and nondiapausing populations of Sesamia nonagrioides Lef. (Lepidoptera-Noctuidae)	PHYSIOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												The influence of long- and short-day cycles on ovipostion and egg hatch of the corn stalk borer, Sesamia nonagrioides were investigated at a range of temperatures. Oviposition was suppressed when insects are exposed to long days through their immature stages and then transferred to short days after mating. Moreover, mean oviposition and egg hatch increased from 15 to 27.5 degreesC, whereas oviposition declined significantly at 30 degreesC at both photoperiodic regimes. Females derived from a diapausing population exposed to long days after mating showed a significantly higher egg production compared to females derived from a nondiapausing population. However, when females from a diapausing population were left to oviposit under short days, fewer eggs were produced compared to those exposed to long days after mating. Thus, photoperiod appears to affect reproductive traits of this species in a quantitative manner. Larval diapause duration is positively correlated with fecundity of the adults. There is also a positive correlation between pupal weight of individuals derived from a diapausing population and the postdiapause fecundity of adults.																	0307-6962					JUN	2004	29	2					169	175		10.1111/j.1365-3032.2004.00381.x								WOS:000221493700010

The aim of the present research was therefore to investigate the daily rhythms of locomotor activity and melatonin in the Senegal sole. For this purpose, the individual locomotor activity rhythms of fish were registered using a photocell. Plasma and ocular melatonin rhythms were studied in animals reared in circular tanks placed in earth under an LD 12:12 light regime and 16-18 degreesC temperature range (spring equinox). Blood and eye samples were taken every 3 h during a complete 24-h cycle. The impact of a light pulse in the middle of the dark period (MID) on plasma melatonin was also studied. Locomotor activity was mainly nocturnal, with 84.3% of the total activity occurring during darkness. The levels of plasma melatonin were higher at night (55 pg/ml) than during the day (2 pg/ml), while ocular melatonin levels appeared to be arrhythmic. Both weight and melatonin content were found to be significantly higher in the left eye in relation to the right eye. A light pulse in MD provoked a significant decrease in plasma melatonin levels. In summary, photoperiod is a key factor in synchronising locomotor activity and melatonin rhythms in the Senegal sole, whose nocturnal habits should be taken into account for their rearing by aquaculture.

J	Huang, C; Xiong, CJ; Kornfeld, K				Huang, C; Xiong, CJ; Kornfeld, K			Measurements of age-related changes of physiological processes that predict lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Aging is characterized by progressive, degenerative changes in many tissues. To elucidate the relationships among degenerative changes in Caenorhabditis elegans, we developed methods to measure age-related changes quantitatively and analyzed correlations among these changes by using a longitudinal study. The age-related declines of pharyngeal pumping and body movement were positively correlated with each other and lifespan. These findings suggest that the declines of pharyngeal pumping and body movement cause a decline in survival probability or that a shared regulatory system mediates the declines in pharyngeal pumping, body movement, and survival probability. Furthermore, measurements of these processes can be used to predict lifespan and detect premature aging. The declines of physiological processes were measured in daf-2, age-1, daf-16, eat-2, and clk-1 mutants that have altered lifespans. Each mutant strain displayed changes in one or more age-related declines, but the correlations among age-related changes were similar to WT. These measurements were used to generate a system of four stages that describes the aging process and is useful for the analysis of genetic and environmental effects on aging.																	0027-8424					MAY 25	2004	101	21					8084	8089		10.1073/pnas.0400848101								WOS:000221652000045	15141086

Comparisons were made between rats without (euthermic, n = 6) and with (acclimated, n = 7) prior exposure to lower ambient temperatures and shorter photoperiod, simulating adaptation to winter conditions. In both groups of rats, acute hypothermia to T-b = 25degreesC shifted the baroreflex-RSNA curve slightly leftwards and downwards with decreases in the setpoint pressure and maximal gain, whereas it markedly impaired the baroreflex-HR curve characterized by decreases in response range by similar to90% (P < 0.001), minimum response by, similar to10% (P < 0.05) and maximum gain by similar to95% (P < 0.001), from that at T-b = 37degreesC. All parameters were restored to precooling levels on rewarming. Electrical stimulation of cardiac vagal efferents induced a voltage-related bradycardia, the magnitude of which was partially reduced during acute hypothermia, and there was a significant prolongation of the electrocardiogram intervals indicating a delay in cardiac conduction. Mild suppression of baroreflex control of RSNA could contribute to hypothermic hypotension and may primarily reflect an effect of T-b on central drive. The marked attenuation of the baroreflex control of HR during hypothermia was likely to be due to an impairment of both the central and peripheral components of the reflex arc. Baroreflex control of RSNA and HR was similar between both groups of rats, which implied that the control was non-adaptive on chronic cold exposure.

In the present work, we performed comparative investigations of temperature-dependent changes in the cytosol state of erythrocytes from animals subjected to natural (winter hibernating ground squirrels) or artificial hypobiosis. The cytosol state was evaluated by the ESR method of spin probes (TEMPON) within the temperature range of 0-50 degreesC. Erythrocyte resistance to acid hemolysis, which is limited by the permeability of membranes for protons and the state of the anion channel, were determined using the method described by Terskov and Getelson [Biofizika 2 (1957) 259]. A change in cytosol microviscosity of erythrocytes was found as well as a temperature-dependent increase in acid resistance of erythrocytes. Our investigations allow us to conclude that physiological changes occurring in a mammalian organism during natural and artificial hypobiosis are accompanied by structural modifications of the erythrocyte cytosol. The temperature range where these modifications are observed (8, 15, 40 degreesC) suggests that the most probable modifying link is spectrin and/or the sites of its interaction with membrane. The interaction of cytoskeletal components with the cell membrane plays a key role in regulation of membrane permeability, suggesting an important role of this interaction in the adaptive reactions of erythrocytes.

Since the mechanism of phytochrome-induced photoperiodism involves the enzymes of cyclic adenosine monophosphate metabolism, and phosphodiesterase in particular, we tested involvement of phosphodiesterase in the process of winter wheat vernalization and formation of flowering competence in alternate wheat requiring a long photoperiod but no vernalization for its transition to flowering. We studied temperature dependence of phosphodiesterase activity in vernalized and unvernalized winter wheat on the one hand and in etiolated and red light illuminated seedlings of alternate wheat on the other hand. Short-term experiments demonstrated that red light illumination is similar to long photoperiod by the effect on the long-day plants. Both influences induced a pronounced inversion of the temperature profile of phosphodiesterase activity in the 28-45degreesC range. We propose that phosphodiesterase is involved in vernalization and can serve as a receptor of low temperature in winter wheat. Changed temperature profile is a radical control mechanism of phosphodiesterase activity in response to the influences (red light and vernalizing temperatures) responsible for competence of various bread wheat forms for generative growth.																	1062-3590					MAY-JUN	2004	31	3					239	243		10.1023/B:BIBU.0000030143.02309.69								WOS:000222307300005

Differences among the treatments were analyzed by ANCOVA and Newman-Keuls multiple range tests. The length-weight growth data, log-transformed, were fitted using an orthogonal least squares method. The results show that food type has marked effects on the growth rate and survival of the animals.

Local oxygen partial pressures (Po-2) were measured with microcoaxial needle electrodes close to larvae submerged in initially air-saturated still water. The Po-2 profiles showed that the larvae exploit oxygen from the aquatic medium. Metabolism in the air of more or less resting larvae was determined by measuring the rate of CO2 production (s(V) over dot CO2) with an infrared gas analyzer at 29 degreesC. The s(V) over dot Co-2 was around 1.8 muL g(-1) min(-1), equivalent to an oxygen consumption rate (s(V) over dot O-2) of 1.8-2.6 muL g(-1) min(-1). Oxygen consumption ((V) over dot O-2) of individually submerged larvae measured in closed respiration chambers at 19 - 10.3 kPa Po-2 (initially air saturated, 29 degreesC) ranged between 0.05 and 0.2 muL min(-1) and was not correlated with body mass. The s(V) over dot O-2 ranged between 0.1 and 0.4 muL min(-1). that is, 4% - 22% of the metabolic rate measured in air. Mean (V) over dot o(2) decreased with declining Po-2; however, some individuals showed contrary patterns. (V) over dot o(2) was additionally measured in dormant larvae, in larvae submerged for 1 - 2 d in open water or for 30 - 49 d within sediment, as well as in larvae exposed to anoxia before the measurements. The range of (V) over dot O-2 was similar in all groups, indicating that the larvae exploit oxygen from the water whenever available. Similar (V) over dot o(2) across the whole range of body mass investigated (0.31 - 0.76 g) suggests that oxygen uptake occurs by spiracular uptake. Assuming that larvae survive for some time at rates comparable to depressed metabolic rates reported for other insect species, it can be concluded that oxygen uptake from water can sustain aerobic metabolism even under quite severe hypoxia. It might therefore play an important role for survival during inundation periods.																	1522-2152					MAY-JUN	2004	77	3					378	389		10.1086/383504								WOS:000223403300004	15286912

A better understanding of the suitability of different host instars would help optimize production and field application. Incidence of parasitism, development time, survivorship and sex ratio were evaluated when different nymphal instars of the sweetpotato whitefly Bemisia tabaci biotype 'Q' were offered for parasitization. Experiments were conducted on sweet pepper at 25 degreesC, 75% RH and 16: 8 (L: D) photoperiod. E. mundus oviposited in all nymphal instars of B. tabaci except the mature 4th instar or pharate adult (previously designated, 'pupa'). Incidence of parasitism was greatest (33.8 +/- 5.1 parasitized nymphs) and development time shortest (14.1 +/- 0.1 d) when oviposition occurred under 2nd and 3rd instar nymphs compared to 1st or 4th instars. Survivorship (85%) and offspring sex ratio (39.8% female) did not differ statistically for parasitoids developing in whiteflies that were parasitized as different instars. Although 2nd and 3rd instars were clearly the most favorable host stage for E. mundus, its capacity to parasitize and develop on a wide range of host stages is a favorable characteristic for both rearing and field application.

In each of these environments, organisms must be capable of surviving freeze-thaw cycles, persistent low temperatures for growth, extremes of solar radiation, and prolonged dormancy. These constraints may have been especially important during global cooling events in the past, including the Precambrian glaciations. One analogue of these early Earth conditions is the thick, landfast sea ice that occurs today at certain locations in the Arctic and Antarctic. These ice shelves contain liquid water for a brief period each summer, and support luxuriant microbial mat communities. Our recent studies of these mats on the Markham Ice Shelf (Canadian high Arctic) by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) showed that they contain high concentrations of chlorophylls a and b, and several carotenoids notably lutein, echinenone and beta-carotene. The largest peaks in the HPLC chromatograms were two UV-screening compounds known to be produced by cyanobacteria, scytonemin, and its decomposition product scytonemin-red. Microscopic analyses of the mats showed that they were dominated by the chlorophyte genera cf. Chlorosarcinopsis, Pleurastrum, Palmellopsis, and Bracteococcus, and cyanobacteria of the genera Nostoc, Phormidium, Leptolyngbya, and Gloeocapsa. From point transects and localized sampling we estimated a total standing stock on this ice shelf of up to 11,200 tonnes of organic matter. These observations underscore the ability of microbial communities to flourish despite the severe constraints imposed by the cryo-ecosystem environment. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Musolin, DL; Numata, H				Musolin, DL; Numata, H			Late-season induction of diapause in Nezara viridula and its effect on adult coloration and post-diapause reproductive performance	ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA												Nezara viridula (L.) (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae) recently expanded its distribution range in Japan and reached Osaka. In the southern temperate zone, the species overwinters in the adult stage and reproductive diapause is associated with a body colour change from green to russet. In Osaka, the reproductive diapause is only induced in September-October and nymphs from late egg masses are destined to die during winter. However, the fate of adults emerging late in the season remained unknown. Survival, body colour change, and post-diapause reproduction were studied under quasi-natural conditions in Osaka in 1999-2000 in those adults that attained adulthood as late as in November. Two experimental cohorts were used: in the Outdoor cohort, insects were reared outdoors starting in their second instar (28 September); in the Laboratory cohort, nymphs and subsequently adults were reared from the same day under diapause-inducing conditions (L10:D14 at 25 degreesC), then acclimatized (5 days at 20 degreesC and 5 days at 15 degreesC; L10:D14) and transferred outdoors on 1 December. Adults in both cohorts did not reproduce in autumn and survived the winter with a low mortality. More than 20% of adults in the Outdoor cohort failed to change body colour from green to russet during winter, apparently because of the low ambient temperature, suggesting that the environmental conditions required for colour change do not completely coincide with those required for diapause induction, and that the colour of the adults is not always a reliable indicator of diapause in this species. After overwintering, females from the Outdoor cohort produced significantly fewer egg masses and eggs and had a significantly shorter period of oviposition than females that entered diapause under short-day conditions in the Laboratory cohort. Thus, if progeny from the late egg masses attain adulthood late in the autumn, these adults have high chances of successful overwintering, but their reproductive output after the winter diapause is significantly reduced.

J	Caley, MJ; Schwarzkopf, L				Caley, MJ; Schwarzkopf, L			Complex growth rate evolution in a latitudinally widespread species	EVOLUTION												The simultaneous effects of selective agents acting on somatic growth rates, their interactions, and their interactions with local environmental conditions that vary across a species' geographic range are potentially complex and poorly known. This is particularly true of viviparous ectotherms whose offspring may be adapted to the gestation environment provided by their mothers. We studied multiple sources of growth rate variation in a widespread, viviparous reptile, including the effect of the maternal environment on growth following parturition. Females in early pregnancy were collected from replicate populations close to the tropical and temperate margins of this species' range. These females completed gestation in either of two different, common environments designed to simulate the thermal and photoperiod environments at the sampling locations. Our experiments revealed complex growth rate evolution between the northern and southern extremes of Eulamprus quoyii's geographic range and local adaptation of growth rates to maternal environments. Unique to this study was the manifestation of these growth rate differences, entrained in utero, but expressed following parturition and maintained through to maturity despite the presence of compensatory growth. In addition to providing the most complete picture to date of the evolution of somatic growth in a viviparous ectotherm, our study suggests that understanding local adaptation to maternal gestation environments, in terms of both mean growth rates and growth rate reaction norms, could change our understanding of how growth rates have evolved in other viviparous ectotherms. Indeed, such local adaptation may provide a selective advantage in the evolution of viviparity.

The genus Erebia shows variability in length of diapause depending on latitude and altitude, which may lead to allochronic differentiation. To test for biennialism and possible asynchronous differentiation, we sequenced the most variable fragments of the mitochondrial control region and the cytochrome oxidase I in forty individuals from the same population, from two consecutive years. No differentiation between cohorts could be detected and therefore the idea of a current annual cycle is supported. We conclude that a biennial cycle may never have been important in this population and we further discuss adaptive strategies this species may have used to confront colder climates.

J	Danks, HV				Danks, HV			Seasonal adaptations in arctic insects	INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY					Annual Meeting of the Society-for-Integrative-and-Comparative-Biology	JAN 04-08, 2003	TORONTO, CANADA	Soc Integrat & Comparat Biol				Many insect species live in the arctic and show a wide range of adaptations to its extreme severity and seasonality. Long, cold winters are met, for example, by cold hardiness and choice of protected sites. Cold hardiness includes both widespread tolerance to freezing and extreme supercooling ability, as well as unusual responses in a few species, such as lack of typical cryoprotectants. Adaptations to short, cool summers include activity at low temperatures, selection of warm habitats and microhabitats, melanism and hairiness coupled with basking behaviour, and prolonged or abbreviated life cycles. Diapause ensures that many species emerge early in summer, with brief synchronized reproduction that maximizes the time for offspring development before winter returns. Some species overwinter in sites that thaw earliest in spring, even if they are relatively exposed in winter. Other adaptations respond to year-to-year variability: for example, prolonged diapause can provide insurance against unsuitable summers. All of these adaptations are co-ordinated. For example, cold hardiness relies on physiological and biochemical adaptations but also on habitat choice and timing. Because the adaptations are complex, predicted climatic warming probably will have unexpected effects. In particular, an increase in temperature that increases summer cloud when sea ice melts would likely reduce temperatures for insect development and activity, because sunshine provides critical warmth to insects and their microhabitats. Changes in moisture will also be important. Moreover, responses differ among species, depending especially on their microhabitats. The complexity of the responses of insects to arctic conditions reinforces the need for research that is sufficiently detailed.																	1540-7063	1557-7023				APR	2004	44	2					85	94		10.1093/icb/44.2.85								WOS:000222909700002	21680489					
J	Villavaso, EJ; Snodgrass, GL				Villavaso, EJ; Snodgrass, GL			Diapause in tarnished plant bug (Heteroptera : Miridae) reared in dynamic photoperiod environmental cabinets	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND URBAN ENTOMOLOGY												Diapause in tarnished plant bugs, Lygus lineolaris (Palisot de Beauvois) (Heteroptera: Miridae), increased with decreasing photoperiods simulated in environmental cabinets to match those at Starkville, Mississippi (latitude 33.45 N). Hypertrophied fat body in males was strongly associated with hypotrophied accessory glands, and these two characteristics were used to classify male diapause. Although the fatty tissue surrounding the testes differentiated diapausing and reproductive males, almost all males had well-developed testes and large quantities of sperm in their seminal vesicles at the time of dissection; thus testis size was not used for diapause classification. Hypertrophied fat body and lack of mature eggs at time of dissection were used to classify female diapause. Simulated decreasing photoperiods beginning on 4 September, 17 September, and 1 October (Julian dates 247, 260, and 274, respectively) resulted in 15.4%, 57.0%, and 86.0% diapause, respectively. Males and females exhibited similar percentages of diapause. When only egg-producing females were considered, fewer eggs were present at time of dissection within females with the largest fat bodies than within females with smaller fat bodies. Diapause morphology was rated numerically and an SAS program was developed to classify diapausing and reproductive insects. Extrapolation from current data indicated that 50% of nymphs eclosing from eggs oviposited near Starkville, Mississippi, about 14 September can be expected to enter diapause.																	1523-5475					APR	2004	21	2					87	97										WOS:000228071000004

This paper traces the flow of copper as it enters and leaves the Latin American and the Caribbean (LAC) economy over 1 year. A regional material flow model was developed to estimate patterns of copper use in the early 1990s throughout LAC. Material balance calculations were used to determine copper flows, including the amount of metal that enters use in society and in waste repositories. A database and modeling tool that records temporal and spatial boundary conditions and data quality was developed for continental substance flow analysis. The result provides a numerical accounting of copper from ore, to product, to potential secondary resource. The modeling also shows how materials are transformed and processed, recovered, and stored at each stage in the life cycle of copper. LAC is a significant global producer of primary copper through its mining, smelting, and refining operations; about three-fourths of this output is exported from the continent. The remainder is fabricated within LAC and enters the societal use reservoir in infrastructure, buildings, industry, private households, and other uses. Chile is the dominant producer and exporter of copper in the region. The majority of copper in finished products is contained in pure form (70%, 212 Gg out of 305 Gg), the remainder in alloy form. Copper from post-consumer waste is roughly 10 times smaller than tailings and slag waste. This research shows that there is a significant stock of copper both in use and hibernating in retired electronic products. There is also an informal recycling system and secondary market that is not quantified, but estimated to be up to 80% of recovered post-consumer copper. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Seasonal variation in day length not only represents an ecological constraint on activity, but also imposes methodological restrictions on analyses. This paper examines the implications of monthly variation in day length using data from a troop of chacma baboons (Papio cynocephalus ursinus) at De Hoop Nature Reserve, South Africa. Time spent feeding, moving, grooming and resting each month were all significant positive functions of day length, confirming its importance as an ecological constraint. More importantly, the results highlighted the necessity of including day length as an independent variable in this form of analysis. Where day length is excluded, there are problems interpreting relationships, since it is impossible to separate out the independent effects of temperature and day length. The analyses also confirmed that percentage time budgets, which have sometimes been used in this form of analysis, are subject to significant biases where data are from populations experiencing substantial degrees of day length variation. Future research must be aware of the methodological constraints imposed by seasonal variation in day length, and further work is clearly required to fully determine its importance.

BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY												An important question in evolutionary ecology is whether different populations across a species range, from core to periphery, experience different levels of stress. The estimation of developmental instability has been proposed as a useful tool for quantifying the degree of environmental and genetic stress that individuals experience during their development. Fluctuating asymmetry, the unsigned difference between the two sides of a bilaterally symmetrical trait, has been suggested to reflect the levels of developmental instability in a population. As such, it has been proposed as a useful tool for estimating changes in developmental instability and in stress response in populations across a range of environmental conditions. Recent studies focusing mostly on birds have detected increasing fluctuating asymmetry from core to periphery across the distribution range, suggesting that peripheral populations may experience higher levels of environmental and/or genetic stress. Most of these comparisons were done for single taxa across a single gradient. However, different species are predicted to respond differently to environmental shifts across the range. We compared asymmetry patterns in wing morphology in populations of two Euchloe butterfly species across their opposing ranges in Israel. Contrary to the patterns observed in birds across the same gradient, bilateral asymmetry did not increase or shift towards the periphery in either of the butterfly species. If fluctuating asymmetry in these traits reflects levels of stress, these results may partly reflect the fact that the range of these two butterfly species is limited by the distribution of their host plant, rather than by abiotic environmental variables. In addition, developing pierids can diapause during harsh seasons and can persist in resource-rich patches, thus minimizing the environmental stress perceived by developing individuals. We conclude that accounting for differences in species' life histories and range-limiting factors is necessary in order to better predict patterns of developmental instability across spatial and environmental gradients.

J	Hao, SG; Kang, L				Hao, SG; Kang, L			Effects of temperature on the post-diapause embryonic development and the hatching time in three grasshopper species (Orth., Acrididae)	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY												A study was conducted to determine the effects of six constant temperatures (15, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40degreesC) on the post-diapause embryonic development and the hatching time in three grasshopper species -Omocestus haemorrhoidalis (Charp.), Calliptamus abbreviatus Ikonn. and Chorthippus fallax (Zub.) - from the Inner Mongolian steppe. The results indicate that the species differ in the developmental rates, survival curves and cumulative hatching probabilities. The eggs of O. haemorrhoidalis had the fastest developmental rate with a low developmental threshold temperature of 9.9degreesC and the sum of effective temperature (SET) 211.2 degree-days (DD). The corresponding values were 10.9degreesC and 210.6 DD for C. abbreviatus, 10.5degreesC and 240.2 DD for Ch. fallax respectively. The SET at which 50% of post-diapause eggs hatched were 252.0 DD for O. haemorrhoidalis, 262.8 DD for C. abbreviatus, and 273.3 DD for Ch. fallax. The predicted maximal hatch ability of O. haemorrhoidalis (91.17%), C. abbreviatus (75.67%) and Ch. fallax (94.07%) occurred at 23.7, 29.0 and 31.3degreesC, respectively. The thermal death points of each species were reached at 43.3, 45.0 and 48.6degreesC. The optimal temperature ranges were 12.2-35.2degreesC for O. haemorrhoidalis, 21.7-36.3degreesC for C. abbreviatus and 20.9-41.7degreesC for Ch. fallax respectively. These results suggest that O. haemorrhoidalis adapt to hatch at a lower temperature range, C. abbreviatus adapt to mid-temperature range, while Ch. fallax adapt to hatch at a higher temperature range. Although the SET of Ch. fallax is more than that of the other two species, it is not sufficient to explain the hatching sequence of the species in springtime. The results also indicate that Ch. fallax and O. haemorrhoidalis have wider adaptive temperature range than C. abbreviatus.																	1439-0418					MAR	2004	128	2					95	101		10.1046/j.1439-0418.2003.00810.x								WOS:000220175600003

This leads to a greater slope of the temperature regression line of the development rate on the temperature, to lower values of the sum of effective temperatures, and to a higher temperature threshold of development in the northern population. Lower temperatures have a stronger effect on development of larvae from the northern population by inducing diapause in the greater number of individuals as compared with larvae from the southern population. The L. niger founder females require, on average, higher temperatures than the females from the southern populations of this species for rearing the first worker ants during the same summer season (i.e., without winter diapause). Thus, ants of the southern populations, when rearing the first brood, use a strategy of faster development at higher temperatures, while low temperatures restrict to the greater extent the development of their brood as compared with ants from the southern populations. It is concluded that one of the ways of physiological adaptation of ants for inhabitance on the North is such change of the norm of response to temperature, at which development becomes more temperature-dependent, the physiological response to higher temperatures increasing at the cost of its decrease at lower temperatures.

J	Sommer, AM; Portner, HO				Sommer, AM; Portner, HO			Mitochondrial function in seasonal acclimatization versus latitudinal adaptation to cold in the lugworm Arenicola marina (L.)	PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL ZOOLOGY												Previous studies in marine ectotherms from a latitudinal cline have led to the hypothesis that eurythermal adaptation to low mean annual temperatures is energetically costly. To obtain more information on the trade-offs and with that the constraints of thermal adaptation, mitochondrial functions were studied in subpolar lugworms (Arenicola marina L.) adapted to summer cold at the White Sea and were compared with those in boreal specimens from the North Sea, either acclimatized to summer temperatures or to winter cold. During summer, a comparison of mitochondria from subpolar and boreal worms revealed higher succinate oxidation rates and reduced Arrhenius activation energies (E(a)) in state 3 respiration at low temperatures, as well as higher proton leakage rates in subpolar lugworms. These differences reflect a higher aerobic capacity in subpolar worms, which is required to maintain motor activity at low but variable environmental temperatures-however, at the expense of an elevated metabolic rate. The lower activity of citrate synthase (CS) found in subpolar worms may indicate a shift in metabolic control within mitochondria. In contrast, acclimatization of boreal lugworms to winter conditions elicited elevated mitochondrial CS activities in parallel with enhanced mitochondrial respiration rates. With falling acclimation temperatures, the significant Arrhenius break temperature in state 3 respiration (11degreesC) became insignificant (5degreesC) or even disappeared (0degreesC) at lower levels of Arrhenius activation energies in the cold, similar to a phenomenon known from hibernating vertebrates. The efficiency of aerobic energy production in winter mitochondria rose as proton leakage in relation to state 3 decreased with cold acclimation, indicated by higher respiratory control ratio values and increased adenosine diphosphate/oxygen (ADP/O) ratios. These transitions indicate reduced metabolic flexibility, possibly paralleled by a loss in aerobic scope and metabolic depression during winter cold. Accordingly, these patterns contrast those found in summer-active, cold-adapted eurytherms at high latitudes.

J	Goto, SG; Kimura, MT				Goto, SG; Kimura, MT			Heat-shock-responsive genes are not involved in the adult diapause of Drosophila triauraria	GENE												Although the molecular regulation of diapause remains largely unknown, there is an accumulation of data suggesting the involvement of heat-shock proteins in the expression of diapause or dormancy. However, Goto et al. [J. Insect Physiol. 44 (1998) 1009] reported that Drosophila triauraria does not express Hsp70 transcripts at normal temperatures, regardless of the diapause state. Here, we investigated the transcriptional regulation of other heat-shock-responsive genes (Hsp23, Hsp26, Hsp83 and Hsrw) in D. triauraria with relation to diapause. The results revealed that these genes are not regulated as a function of diapause, suggesting that they are not involved in the expression of diapause in this species. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

J	Van Driesche, RG; Nunn, C; Pasquale, A				Van Driesche, RG; Nunn, C; Pasquale, A			Life history pattern, host plants, and habitat as determinants of population survival of Pieris napi oleracea interacting with an introduced braconid parasitoid	BIOLOGICAL CONTROL												Pieris napi oleracea Harris is a native pierid butterfly whose range in New England has decreased since the 1869 invasion of an exotic congener, Pieris rapae (L.). Populations have disappeared from all but a few locations in western Massachusetts, but persist more widely in northern Vermont. Parasitism by the introduced braconid wasp Cotesia glomerata (L.) has been postulated as responsible for this decline. Field exposures of cohorts of P. napi larvae in 2002 showed that, on the summer host plant Sisymbrium officinale (L.) Scoop., parasitism rates of second generation butterfly larvae were very high (100% in Massachsusetts and 66% in Vermont). Direct observations of host plant and habitat use patterns by P. napi females in northern Vermont in 2000 showed that this species changes habitats between the first and second generation, with over 95% of eggs of the first generation of P. napi being laid in wooded habitats on the crucifer Cardamine. (formerly Dentaria) diphylla (Michx.) Wood. Second generation butterflies fly in meadows and oviposit on S. officinale and other crucifers in full-sun habitats. The second flight of P. napi is, however, only a partial generation, with many first generation pupae entering diapause. The proportion of butterflies entering diapause increases if eggs are laid on C diphylla plants at or past the flower bud stage. Of first instar P. napi reared outdoors on pre-flower-bud C diphylla, 63% (n = 64) entered diapause in Massachusetts, but 86% (n = 119) did so in northern Vermont. Higher rates of diapause in early larval groups in northern Vermont, plus lower rates of parasitism of second generation larvae in meadows, as compared to Massachusetts, indicate that the impact of C glomerata on total population survival is lower in Vermont and is likely the reason P. napi has persisted in northern Vermont, but not in western Massachusetts. This case illustrates how non-target effects of parasitoids may be mediated by habitat and life history features of populations of affected insects, which may differ geographically.

J	Braby, MF; Douglas, F				Braby, MF; Douglas, F			The taxonomy, ecology and conservation status of the Golden-rayed Blue: a threatened butterfly endemic to western Victoria, Australia	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY												The Golden-rayed Blue, Candalides noelkeri sp. nov. (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae), from the Wimmera of western Victoria, Australia, is described and illustrated. The male and female genitalia and immature stages are figured, described and compared with those of Candalides heathi and C: xanthospilos. Candalides noelkeri sp. nov. is placed in the C. xanthospilos species-group, being most closely allied to and allopatric with C. heathi. It is predominantly univoltine, with adults usually present from late November to early February. However, it has a facultative pupal diapause that gives rise to a partial overlapping second generation in mid-summer. The species is ecologically specialized, monophagous and has a narrow geographical range, currently known only from two localities in a restricted area near Natimuk. Within this limited area it is restricted to flood plains bordering natural salt-lakes where the larval food plant, a prostrate form of Myoporum paruifolium (Myoporaceae), grows as a low spreading ground cover plant. Morphological and geological evidence suggest a recent (late Pleistocene) allopatric speciation event between C. noelkeri sp. nov. and C. heathi. The small, peripheral spatial distribution of C. noelkeri sp. nov. implies that differentiation has been achieved by the founder effect, either through peripheral isolates speciation (peripatric speciation) or postspeciation dispersal, possibly as a result of a barrier created by the volcanic plains in western Victoria. Available information indicates that C. noelkeri sp. nov., Victoria's only endemic species of butterfly, is facing a high risk of extinction and accordingly its conservation status should be considered as Endangered. The most serious threat at the type locality is habitat change or succession caused by invasion of Melaleuca halmaturorum, which is creating a dense shaded paperbark forest that is reducing both the preferred open sunny microhabitat and the extent of the larval food plant. Recognition of C. noelkeri sp. nov. as a flagship taxon is likely to enhance the conservation of biodiversity in remnant flood plain/salt-lake ecosystems of temperate south-eastern Australia.

J	Chmura, GL; Hung, GA				Chmura, GL; Hung, GA			Controls on salt marsh accretion: A test in salt marshes of Eastern Canada	ESTUARIES												We used Cs-137-dating to determine vertical accretion rates of 15 salt marshes on the Bay of Fundy, the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia. Accretion rates are compared to a number of factors assumed to influence vertical marsh accretion: rates of relative sea-level rise, climatic parameters (average daily temperatures and degree days) and latitude (related to insolation and day length), sediment characteristics (organic matter inventory, bulk, mineral, and organic matter density), distance of the core site from the nearest source of tidal waters, and the tidal range. Unique to our study is a consideration of climatic parameters and latitude, which should influence organic matter production, and thus vertical accretion rates. Significant predictors of accretion rates (in order of importance) were found to be organic matter inventory, distance from a creek, and range of mean tides. Contrary to conclusions from previous studies, we found that accretion rates decreased with increasing tidal range, probably because we considered a wider span of tidal ranges, from micro- to macrotidal. Although four marshes with low organic matter inventories also show a deficit in accretion with respect to relative sea-level rise, organic matter is not limiting in two-thirds of the marshes studied, despite shorter growing seasons.																	0160-8347					FEB	2004	27	1					70	81		10.1007/BF02803561								WOS:000221048900006

Therefore, the mixture of fuels provided and their individual flux must be tightly orchestrated to cope with changing physiological needs. In exercising mammals, metabolic rate-expressed relatively to the aerobic maximum: %VO2 max-determines what mixture of oxidative fuels is being used. This simple model of fuel selection accurately predicts the relative contributions of lipids and carbohydrates to total metabolism, and it applies widely across body sizes, aerobic capacities, and even to exercise in hypoxic environments. However, it is also becoming obvious that significant exceptions to this pattern exist in other vertebrates that rely more heavily on lipids (e.g., migrating birds) or proteins (e.g., migrating salmonids), or for stresses other than exercise (e.g., cold exposure in mammals). Instantaneous fuel use is determined by multiple interacting mechanisms involving fuel availability, storage location, muscle recruitment, fiber recruitment within each muscle, and metabolic pathway selection within each fiber. These various mechanisms are being characterized in more detail to try designing a general model of fuel selection applicable to a wider range of animals and physiological stresses.

Few results are available on the impact of parasitoid populations on aphid hosts during autumn and winter and on the dynamics of their interactions during this period. The population development of Sitobion avenae, in Belgium, is analysed, from October to April, in the presence and absence of the parasitoid Aphidius rhopalosiphi. In the presence of parasitoids in winter, aphid populations decreased markedly and remained low at the beginning of spring. Induction of winter diapause in A. rhopalosiphi was observed during November at a mean temperature of 6.3 degreesC and a decreasing photoperiod from 9.5-8.5 h of day light. A large range of A. rhopalosiphi mummy colourations, between dark and light, was noticed. This range of colouration did not allow a clear-cut distinction between diapausing and non-diapausing individuals of A. rhopalosiphi.

The highest rates of parasitism were 83.3 and 15% of B. fusca and C. partellus, respectively. No development occurred on S. calamistis due to maggot encapsulation. At 25 +/- 0.5degreesC, S. parasitica larval development on non-diapausing B. fusca larvae took 14.2 d (range 10-34) and the pupal period 13.7 d for males and 15.8 d for females. Adult females that developed on C. partellus were smaller than those from B. fusca but had a similar lifespan (approximate to4 wk). Although first observed at 6 d after mating, maggot production peaked at 848 per female after a 12-d gestation period. Inoculation of diapausing B. fusca larvae resulted in an extended larval period of the tachinids, indicating that the seasonal carryover of S. parasitica in diapausing B. fusca larvae in Zimbabwe could be a hormone-induced physiological response.

Our demographic study included a survey of survival and fecundity of adults in quadrate plots marked at two sites in natural vegetation (one site per population), and the creation of experimental seed banks examined over three years. We measured variability in population growth rate and investigated the role of the seed bank in the demography of two populations. The latter employed construction of two-stage, three age-class transition matrices and usage of elasticity analysis. At both sites, population dynamics appear to be transient with high fluctuations of population growth rate due to variability in annual rainfall and, most likely, intra- and inter-specific density dependence. The importance of the seed bank differed among two populations. Seed dormancy had almost no demographic effect on the Mediterranean population, while it was of paramount importance in the desert population. The two populations also differed in seed and seedling survival and per adult fecundity, presumably due to the difference between two sites in (i) relative impact of seed predation, (ii) effects of density dependence on population demography, and (iii) lower vigor of seeds of desert vs. Mediterranean origin. Our study highlights the importance of life history adaptations that may evolve under specific selective forces in different parts of a species' range, which, in certain circumstances, may be critical for the persistence of a species.

Human-caused environmental changes may affect photo-responsive birds in two ways: (1) The photoperiod may become an unreliable predictor of favourable conditions if the phase relationship between temperature-dependent resource availability and daylength changes. For example, advances in the timing of breeding in response to increased spring temperature expose juvenile birds to altered photoperiodic conditions, which may result in unseasonably early autumn migration. (2) Range shifts and expansions may expose birds to novel photoperiodic conditions. Extant responses to these conditions could limit the potential of birds to evade increasingly unsuitable habitats and to establish new breeding and wintering grounds. However, if birds respond to novel photoperiodic conditions in an adaptive way-i.e., the elicited phenotypic change is in accord with the direction of selection-then adaptation of avian life cycles to global environmental change will be facilitated. In the course of environmental change, we expect the photoperiodic response itself to be the target of selection. However, adaptive evolution of the response to daylength may not keep pace with rapid environmental changes because of unfavourable genetic correlations among life-cycle stages or the lack of within-population genetic variation in phenotypic plasticity.

J	Wise, IL; Lamb, RJ				Wise, IL; Lamb, RJ			Diapause and emergence of Sitodiplosis mosellana (Diptera : Cecidomyiidae) and its parasitoid Macroglenes penetrans (Hymenoptera : Pteromalidae)	CANADIAN ENTOMOLOGIST												The requirements for successful diapause of field-collected larvae and emergence of the adult wheat midge, Sitodiplosis mosellana (Gehin), and its egg parasitoid Macroglenes penetrans (Kirby) were investigated in the laboratory. Both species showed little decline in survival for up to 5 weeks at 20 degreesC in dry wheat spikes and could successfully diapause in wheat spikes at 0 degreesC for at least 200 d, although larvae usually drop to the soil to diapause. Both species diapaused successfully in clay loam and fine quartz sand, but survival was lower in vermiculite or coarse activated clay. Diapause was completed successfully at soil temperatures of -5 to 2.5 degreesC, and both species survived for at least 500 d at 2.5 degreesC with no increase in mortality. Larval survival declined after 120 d at -10 degreesC. Usually more than 95% of all surviving wheat midges emerged as adults after a single diapause period of 100 d or more, but up to 5% of wheat midges and 12%-57% of parasitoids did not emerge until they were exposed to a second cold period. Postdiapausal larvae pupated and adult wheat midges emerged at constant temperatures of 16, 20, 26, and 28 degreesC with no differences in mortality, although none emerged at 10 degreesC. The timing of wheat midge emergence was temperature dependent, requiring 306 degree-days above a threshold of 9 degreesC. Degree-day requirements and soil temperatures from a nearby weather station accurately predicted the average timing of emergence in the field, but not the year-to-year variation in date of 50% emergence. The wheat midge and its parasitoid are well adapted to the conditions they encounter in their range in western Canada. Methods for rearing both species through diapause and adult emergence are described.																	0008-347X					JAN-FEB	2004	136	1					77	90										WOS:000220109400004

Clones were established from aphids collected at each location. The host preferences were studied in free choice tests. Biotypes were characterized on the basis of aphid antibiosis and host plant tolerance. The production of sexuals was assessed under natural conditions, from March to November in 1997-2001, at La Plata (34degrees55' S, 57degrees57' W). The greenbug distribution ranged from 24degrees40' to 43degrees28' S, and was bounded between isothermals 18-20degreesC and 8-10degreesC, and isohyets 400-600 mm and greater than 1200 mm. The aphids at all localities were collected from a wide range of cultivated and wild hosts. The biotypes in ten out of thirty-four populations were identified. One population was obligatorily parthenogenetic, the remainder cyclically parthenogenetic. No correlation was found between the region they came from and the period required for the induction of sexuals. RWA was found between 26degrees50' and 43degrees28'S, bounded by the isothermals 20-22degreesC and 8-10degreesC, and isohyets 400-600 mm and 2000 mm. In Chile, this aphid was only found in Osorno County, which lies on isothermal 8-10degreesC and is bounded by the isohyets 1000 mm and 2000 mm. Only a few RWA genotypes (clones) produced sexuals irrespective of the host they were collected from, period of the year, region, current host, or the day length and average temperature of the rearing conditions. For the first time, RWA was found infesting Cultivated as well as wild oats in South America. At low latitudes, populations of both aphid species were found only infesting wild Sorghum halepensis (L).																	1210-5759						2004	101	1					193	198		10.14411/eje.2004.024								WOS:000220657200019						
J	Imai, C				Imai, C			Photoperiodic induction and termination of summer diapause in adult Epilachna admirabilis (Coleoptera : Coccinellidae) from a warm temperate region	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY												In warm temperate and subtropical regions an adult summer diapause regulates the timing of oviposition. Epilachna admirabilis is a univoltine phytophagous lady beetle ranging from south to north Japan, Taiwan, China and Myanmar. In Japan the species hibernates in the full-grown larval stage. In cool temperate Sapporo (43degrees04'N) the adults never enter summer diapause but pass a second winter in diapause. This study revealed that in Kyoto (35degrees01'N), the adults had a summer diapause induced by an intermediate photoperiodic response; they had a critical photoperiod of approximately 14.5 h light per day. All females entered reproductive diapause under a long photoperiod of 16L (light) : 8D (dark) and 6.7% of them did so under shorter photoperiods of 13L : 11D and 12L : 12D. However, diapause incidence was 40% at 8L : 16D, suggesting the existence of a second critical photoperiod at a photophase slightly less than 8 h. At photophases of 12-15 h, non-diapausing females laid eggs on average between 27.1 to 39.0 days after emergence. Photoperiod reversibly regulated the induction, maintenance and termination of the adult diapause. Temperatures of 20-30degreesC did not affect the incidence and termination of diapause at 16L : 8D. Adult winter diapause at the higher latitude Sapporo might have originated from adult summer diapause at middle latitude regions such as Kyoto. Selection at increasing latitudes would have forced northerly populations of the species to lose the adult summer diapause in the range of natural day-lengths. Subsequent selection pressure should have favored adults that avoided futile oviposition in late summer or autumn, survived cold winters in diapause and commenced an additional oviposition in the second summer. Thus, a latitudinal difference in photoperiodic responses might have developed.																	1210-5759						2004	101	4					523	529		10.14411/eje.2004.074								WOS:000226471400004

(Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), in various commodities. Thermal treatments are gaining acceptance to replace chemical fumigation. Determining the most thermal-tolerant life stage is essential in the development of effective postharvest insect control protocols based on thermal energy. A heating block system was used to evaluate relative heat resistance of five different life stages of codling moth: white-ring eggs, black-head eggs, third-instar, fifth-instar, and diapausing larvae, at a heating rate of 15degreesC/min. The fifth-instar was the most heat-resistant life stage in the tested temperature range of 50-52degreesC except for diapausing larvae. Thermal death kinetic data of diapausing fifth-instar larvae were determined and also compared with the published TDT curve of non-diapausing larvae using the same heating block system. Both diapausing and non-diapausing larvae were dead after treatments at 50degreesC for 5 min and 52degreesC for 2 min. However, at the lower temperatures or shorter times, diapausing larvae had lower mortality than non-diapausing larvae. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Wagner, DM; Drickamer, LC				Wagner, DM; Drickamer, LC			Abiotic habitat correlates of Gunnison's prairie dog in Arizona	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Prairie dog (Cynomys spp.) populations have been reduced by 98% compared to historical levels because of widespread poisoning, habitat loss, recreational shooting, and outbreaks of sylvatic plague (Yersinia pestis). Our objectives were to identify habitat correlates of Gunnison's prairie dog (C. gunnisoni) colonies and to develop a predictive logistic regression model to identify potential reintroduction sites for this species. During 2000 and 2001, we examined habitat features at 50 Gunnison's prairie dog colonies and 50 paired random sites in northern Arizona, USA. When compared to random sites, Gunnison's prairie dog colonies had deeper soils, less variability in slope, and less rock ground cover. Our results suggest the importance of deep soils for allowing Gunnison's prairie dogs to establish hibernacula below the frost line. Our model allows prediction of the probability of Gunnison's prairie dog presence at a site based on soil depth, standard deviation of slope, and surface rock cover, and should aid managers in reestablishing this species throughout its historical range.

Sativa-falcata hybrids represent a possible solution to current yield stagnation in alfalfa. In this study we characterized sativa-falcata hybrid biomass yield based on testcrosses of falcata germplasm from throughout its geographic range to elite sativa germplasm tester populations. Morphological, geographic, climate of origin, and molecular marker variables of the falcata parents were used to determine which were most predictive of hybrid biomass yield. European falcata and falcata with good autumn growth were consistent predictors of improved sativa-falcata hybrid performance. Molecular markers clearly separated the two subspecies; however, within falcata no clear genetic structure was found that correlated with geography or biomass yield heterosis. Based on this study, germplasm could be pre-selected before testcrossing based on geography and fall growth. This would alleviate some of the need for falcata-sativa testcrossing and evaluation, the most expensive and time-consuming part of hybrid cultivar development. In conjunction with this study, efforts are underway to dissect and map components of autumn growth and dormancy and determine their relationship with biomass yield. Mapping individual yield components could lead to QTL or candidate gene discovery, which would be useful in a marker assisted selection program.																			1-4020-1867-3				2004	11						315	324										WOS:000189462500027

For poikilothermic organisms, phenology is largely determined through adaptive evolution with the prevailing climate, and in particular, annual temperature cycles. In addition to the direct effect of temperature, most temperate region insects have physiological mechanisms (e.g., diapause) that help to maintain an adaptive seasonality. The mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins), however, exhibits no obvious manifestations of diapause. This has led to the ecologically important question: How is an appropriate seasonality maintained in the mountain pine beetle without the synchronizing influence of diapause? In answer to this basic question, we briefly review the mathematical relationship between environmental temperatures and developmental timing and discuss the consequences of viewing these models as circle maps from the cycle of oviposition dates and temperatures of one year to oviposition dates for subsequent generations. Univoltinism, associated with reproductive success for the mountain pine beetle, is related to stable fixed points of the developmental circle map. Univoltine fixed points are stable and robust in broad temperature bands, but lose stability suddenly to maladaptive cycles at the edges of these bands. This leads to the obvious observation that temperatures (weather) can be too cold for the mountain pine beetle to thrive, as well as the less obvious implication that it can also be too warm. These results are placed in an ecological and management context by relating adaptive seasonality to outbreak potential. The relationship between outbreak potential and temperature is further considered in view of climate change (i.e., global warming). We briefly note the potential for global warming to intensify outbreak characteristics in the current range of mountain pine beetle, as well as promote invasion into new habitats, such as the high elevation pines and northern range expansion into Canadian jack pine.																	0830-0453		0-662-38389-3				2004	399						210	222										WOS:000226974200023						
J	Brown, IM; Wharton, DA; Millar, RB				Brown, IM; Wharton, DA; Millar, RB			The influence of temperature on the life history of the Antarctic nematode Panagrolaimus davidi	NEMATOLOGY												Panagrolaimus davidi is a free-living microbivore, associated with moss and algal patches in coastal regions around Ross Island, Antarctica. In laboratory experiments, temperature had a major influence on P. davidi life history parameters. The optimal temperature occurred between 25 and 30 degrees C and the temperature at which population growth ceased was estimated at 6.8 degrees C. Threshold temperatures for developmental processes were in the range 4.1 degrees C (for egg incubation) to 7.6 degrees C (for generation time). The life history strategy of P. davidi shows r-selected features and is more similar to temperate free-living nematodes than to other polar species, which show K-selected features. In the Antarctic, P. davidi is forced to remain dormant for long periods and growth occurs intermittently when conditions allow, suggesting A selection. The life history of P. davidi thus exhibits both A and r-selected features.

Two hundred fresh eggs (less than 24h old) were placed individually inside glass flasks, and exposed to seven constant temperatures (10, 12.5, 15,20,25,30 and 35degreesC), in separate experiments. These were carried out in environmental chambers, at 80-90% relative humidity and 8L:16D photoperiod. After hatch, larvae were fed tender foliage of Spanish cedar (Cedrela odorata) and were inspected every 24h to determine larval and pupal duration, and adult emergence, at each temperature. Relationships between these variables and temperature were analyzed by means of ANOVA, regression and correlation procedures. Temperature greatly influenced development of H. grandella immature stages and adult emergence; development time varied between 30 days (30degreesC) and 104 days (15degreesC). Larval mortality was high at those temperatures, reaching values of 90% (15degreesC) and 45% (30degreesC). Also, mortality of the first larval instar was relatively high (51-75%) at all temperatures in the range 15-30degreesC, except at 25degreesC (14%). Pupal weight was lower at extreme temperatures (15degreesC and 30degreesC). Estimation of a common lower thermal threshold for all immature stages (8.5degreesC) allowed calculation of a general thermal constant (1320 degree-days), which could be used to predict population peaks in the field.																	1519-566X					JAN-FEB	2004	33	1					1	6		10.1590/S1519-566X2004000100002								WOS:000224741800002

In `photoperiodic flexible breeds', such as Australian cashmere goats, the annual breeding season can be manipulated through nutrition, whereas in `photoperiodic rigid breeds', such as Creole goats from subtropical Mexico, sexual activity can be controlled by altering the photoperiod. In males from the latter breed, artificial long days, whether or not accompanied by the administration of melatonin, stimulate sexual activity during the 'on-breeding season. These treated males are able to induce the sexual activity of anoestrous females through the male effect under intensive or extensive conditions. Photoperiodic treatments and the male effect can be easily integrated into different breeding management systems in subtropical latitudes.

Before they were domesticated, animals developed reproductive strategies that coped with these changes and often took advantage of them. The physiological processes that implement these strategies have been modified to some extent during several millennia of controlled breeding, but most persist. Thus, many genotypes still exhibit profound responses to external inputs, such as the induction of ovulation by sociosexual signals and the doubling of litter size by a change in nutrition. The complexity in these responses is now becoming clearer. For example, with sociosexual signals, we now need to consider the stimulatory effects of males on females, of females on males and of females on females. Similarly, the impact of nutrition has been extended beyond the control of puberty and the production of gametes to include phenomena such as 'fetal programming', with its potentially profound effects on the life-long performance of the animals. Fortunately, our capacity to research these phenomena has been greatly enhanced by technical improvements in hormone assays, molecular and cellular biology, and real-time ultrasound. This has brought us a better understanding of several of the environmental influences on reproduction, including: the cellular processes within ovarian follicles that mediate the effect of nutrition on ovulation rate; the neuroendocrine pathways through which nutritional inputs affect the brain centres that control appetite and reproduction; and the intracerebral pathways through which sociosexual signals ( olfactory and non-olfactory) stimulate the reproductive axis. Importantly, we are now beginning to realise that, as well as considering interactions between environmental inputs and genotype, we need to take into account interactions between the environmental factors themselves, just as the animals do. We still have a long way to go for a complete understanding, but we are nevertheless in a position where we can begin to use this information to develop new management systems for our animals to improve their productivity.

J	Chamorro-Moreno, S; Rosua-Campos, JL				Chamorro-Moreno, S; Rosua-Campos, JL			The relationships between lengthening capacity of seedlings and the post-fire germinative behaviour of six Cistus species	REVUE D ECOLOGIE-LA TERRE ET LA VIE												Several thermal treatments simulating forest-fire effects were applied to the seeds of six Cistus species to ascertain both the maximum temperature endured, and the temperature interval needed to break their dormancy. The greatest lengthening capacity of the hypocotyls was also determined. Taking into account the typical temperatures reached in the soil profile during several forest-fire regimes, together with both the lengthening capacity of the hypocotyls, and the germinative behaviour after different thermal pulses of the seeds, we established a theoretical range of burying depth at which these seeds endure the pyrogenic heat pulse, break their dormancy, germinate, and emerge from the soil. For buried seeds, the data revealed three groups with different tolerance to forest fires: the cluster of C. crispus, C. ladanifer and C. monspeliensis, and the cluster of C. albidus and C. populifolius, which withstood thermal Pulses of low and high intensity, respectively and C. salvifolius, which withstood moderate-intensity heat pulses. The data analysis indicated that elongation capacity of the hypocotyls accounted for the above interspecific differences. In addition, some traits of the seeds as size, and capacity of dissemination away the mother-plant, together with soil texture and fire regime are discussed to in terms of the interspecific differences in post-fire colonization behaviour of these species.

J	Andersson, B; Fedorkov, A				Andersson, B; Fedorkov, A			Longitudinal differences in Scots pine frost hardiness	SILVAE GENETICA												The autumn frost hardiness of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) populations from Scandinavia (57degrees28'-68degrees54' N, 13degrees00'-27degrees-00' E) and the Komi Republic in Russia (61degrees30'-64degrees20' N, 49degrees10'-54degrees50' E), and open pollinated families from a population in Komi (61degrees43'N, 51degrees07'E) were examined in artificial freezing tests with one-year-old seedlings. The aims were to estimate genetic variation in hardiness between families of Russian origin and to compare populations of Russian (continental) and Scandinavian (maritime) origins. The longitudinal distance between the Scandinavian and Russian seed sources was associated with a significant difference in climatic conditions. At latitude 63degreesN the degree of continentality (the difference between July and January monthly mean temperatures) was 23.7degreesC for longitude 15degreesE in Sweden and 35.2degreesC for longitude 54degreesE in Komi. The narrow-sense heritability of frost hardiness calculated for the Russian families was 0.22. This indicates relatively high genetic control of the trait, of similar magnitude as earlier shown for populations of Scandinavian origin. Both Scandinavian and Russian populations showed a strong clinal variation in frost hardiness, northern populations being the hardiest. In addition, Russian populations were more frost hardy than Scandinavian ones from corresponding latitudes and attained the same level of hardiness as Scandinavian populations from 4.1degrees latitude further north. The results indicate that the longitude or continentality of the origins of Scots pine populations is associated with adaptive pressures that have significant effects on hardiness and are distinct from photoperiodic effects. When enriching breeding or production populations by including populations from remote origins it is essential to recognize not only latitudinal origin, but also longitudinal origin or temperature regime, in order to match material to the planned utilization areas.

The parasitoid Centistes gasseni Shaw is the first braconid to be described parasitizing Diabrotica in South America, and high natural infestations are reported. Field and experimental observations on the host range, distribution and biology of this parasitoid are described. Centistes gasseni was collected in southern Brazil, eastern Paraguay and northeastern Argentina, in a region comprising humid lowlands and highlands, and cool temperate to warm subtropical climates, with regular rainfall in excess of 1300 mm. Three Diabrotica species, D. limitata (Sahlberg), D. speciosa (Germar) and D. viridula (Fabricius) were found to host the parasitoid, with mean percent parasitism of 5.4, 2.0 and 1.0%, respectively. Diabrotica speciosa and D. viridula are the two most important pest Diabrotica species in South America. Laboratory experiments with field-collected beetles and parasitoid cocoons indicated that C. gasseni overwinters in adult host beetles, remaining dormant in its live host below developmental temperatures. A potential distribution of C. gasseni in North America is proposed based on its known climatic range and the distribution of the main pest species of adult overwintering North American Diabrotica.																	0007-4853					DEC	2003	93	6					561	567		10.1079/BER2003263								WOS:000187925300010

Reproductively inactive echidnas were on average significantly heavier (median: 3354 g; range: 2929-3780 g; N=4) than lactating females (median: 2695 g; range: 2690-2715 g; N=3) during the equivalent time period. The median water flux rate of lactating echidnas (152 ml day(-1); range: 120-198 ml day(-1)) did not differ significantly from that of non-lactating females (170 ml day(-1); range: 128-227 ml day(-1)). The median DEE of echidnas that were lactating was 645 kJ day(-1) (range: 581-850 kJ day(-1)), which was not different from the median DEE of non-reproductive control females (763 kJ day(-1); range: 720-766 kJ day(-1)). Lactating females somehow compensate for the energy costs of milk production, resulting in a daily energy budget that is not different from that of non-reproductive females. At least part of their energy minimising strategy could involve the use of moderate heterothermy, allowing a greater proportion of daily energy expenditure to diverted to milk production.

J	Nicol, S; Andersen, NA				Nicol, S; Andersen, NA			Control of breathing in the echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) during hibernation	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY A-MOLECULAR & INTEGRATIVE PHYSIOLOGY					6th International Congress of Comparative Physiology and Biochemistry	FEB 02-07, 2003	MT BULLER, AUSTRALIA					Resting non-hibernating echidnas are characterised by low metabolic rates, but also have a very low respiratory frequency and a variable respiratory minute volume, often resulting in low levels of arterial 02 and high CO, As the echidna lies at one physiological extreme among the hibernators, in terms of its large size and low metabolism and ventilatory requirement when not hibernating, a study of control of breathing during hibernation in echidnas should provide a useful test of the generality of various models. We used non-invasive techniques to study breathing patterns and the control of ventilation in 6 echidnas. Hibernating echidnas (T-b range 7-10 degreesC) showed episodic breathing with bursts of breaths (average 36+/-16 breaths in 24+/-5 min) followed by a period of apnea (76+/-17 min) then a series (8+/-4) of slow breaths at 14+/-1 min intervals leading up to the next burst. Increasing CO2 levels in the inspired air increased the number of breaths in a burst, eventually leading to continuous breathing. Inter burst breaths were controlled by 0,: hypoxia increased inter burst breaths, and decreased burst length, while hyperoxia abolished inter burst breaths and increased the apneic period. Overall, while CO2 was a strong respiratory stimulus in hibernating echidnas, O-2 had little effect on total ventilation, but did have a strong effect on the breathing pattern. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

J	Musolin, DL; Numata, H				Musolin, DL; Numata, H			Timing of diapause induction and its life-history consequences in Nezara viridula: is it costly to expand the distribution range?	ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												1. From the early 1960s to 2000 Nezara viridula (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae) expanded its range northwards in Japan and reached Osaka following climate warming recorded in the region. 2. The timing of diapause induction and its effect on life-history traits were studied under quasi-natural conditions in Osaka. Egg masses were placed outdoors in six series in July-November 1999. Developmental events were monitored until September 2000. 3. Adult diapause was induced in September-October in agreement with the photoperiodic response obtained under laboratory conditions. Induction of diapause in early October ensured the highest winter survival. Nymphs that hatched after late September died by December-April showing that the species cannot survive winter in the nymphal stage. 4. Life-history traits varied between the early (non-diapause reproduction) and late (post-diapause reproduction) series. Thus, non-diapause females produced significantly fewer egg masses than did females that reproduced only after diapause. The timing of diapause induction strongly affected overwintering success and post-diapause performance: females that became adults and entered diapause in October lived longer, had a longer period of oviposition, and produced more eggs in larger egg masses than females that attained adulthood and entered diapause in September. 5. Females from the early series reproduced until late November, although progeny from the late September eggs were destined to die during the winter. Pre-winter reproduction of adults that emerged in mid-September or later was a result of the imperfect timing of diapause induction. It is an ineffective allocation of resources and may be considered the ecological cost of range expansion. 6. To establish in the region, N. viridula will probably evolve a lengthening of the critical photoperiod of the diapause induction response. This will allow the species to enter diapause earlier and, thus, avoid maladaptive late-autumn reproduction but, perhaps, increase the cost of diapause because of a possible adverse impact of pre-winter high temperature conditions on overwintering.

The dynamics of seasonal activity in this species is characterized by two peaks - in early July and early or mid-August. In Moldova, the B. cephalotes abundance maximums are equal, but in Mordovia, the first peak is twice higher that the second. In both regions, B. cephalotes larva and adult hibernate. The hibernated individuals start breeding earlier than nonhibernated beetles do. However, the maximal and mean number of eggs per female in hibernated and nonhibernated individuals were almost equal. Two seasonal rhythms were observed in B. cephalotes reproduction. The rhythm characteristic of the individuals hibernating at the larva stage provides a one-year life cycle. The other rhythm observed in hibernating imago results in the two-year development of the species. Thus, the B. cephalotes life cycle is polyvariant with summer-autumn breeding period, multiseasonal activity of imago and spring-autumn activity of larvae. Geographical variability of the seasonal activity of B. cephalotes, its similarity and differences from that in other related species is discussed.

Considerable variation is evident in the period, phase, and amplitude of 150 Arabidopsis accessions, and the period length is correlated with the day length at the latitude of origin, implying the adaptive significance of correctly regulated circadian timing. Quantitative trait loci analysis of recombinant inbred lines indicates that multiple loci interact to determine period, phase, and amplitude.

Wasps were reared from several mirid species collected on numerous host plants, but most parasitoids (>85%) were reared from Taylorilygus apicalis (Fieber), which was the most abundant mirid. Parasitism rates ranged from 0 to 37% and averaged approximate to7% for the entire study. Excluding samples where parasitism was not observed, parasitism rates averaged approximate to9%. Parasitism levels were highest in the summer. Host plant species significantly influenced parasitism levels of T apicalis; nymphs on Conyza spp. suffered approximate to16% parasitism, significantly more than nymphs on other host plants. L. argentinensis was collected throughout the study area (approximate to22-35degreesS), although the entire geographic range of this species is not yet known. We observed a transition from a male-biased sex ratio in the summer to a female-biased sex ratio in the fall. L. argentinensis has several generations per year and apparently produces some diapausing individuals in each generation. The incidence of diapause was lowest in the summer (approximate to40%). In laboratory trials, L. argentinensis readily parasitized Lygus lineolaris (Palisot de Beauvois) and Lygus hesperus Knight, suggesting that L. argentinensis has potential as a biological control agent for these pests in the United States.																	0013-8746					NOV	2003	96	6					834	846		10.1603/0013-8746(2003)096[0834:LASHBA]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000187454900016						
J	Gerrish, GA; Caceres, CE				Gerrish, GA; Caceres, CE			Genetic versus environmental influence on pigment variation in the ephippia of Daphnia pulicaria	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The dormant eggs of Daphnia (Crustacea: cladocera) are encased in a protective, chitonous casing known as an ephippium. Ephippia are pigmented with melanin, and the degree of pigmentation ranges from transparent to opaque. Variation in pigmentation exists within and across populations and species, raising questions about the factors that influence the natural distribution of pigmentation. 2. We used image analysis to quantify pigmentation in ephippial casings of Daphnia pulicaria that were produced both in the field and in the laboratory. The percentage of the surface area of ephippia that is darkly pigmented ranged from 0.5 to 99.5%. The range, mean and variance of ephippial pigmentation varied across our 11 study lakes. 3. Laboratory experiments compared clonal variation (five clones/lake) and population variation (five lakes) at three temperatures (15 degreesC, 20 degreesC and 25 degreesC). The degree of pigment variation between clones was much greater than pigment variation between temperatures, indicating that there is a genetic component to pigmentation in the ephippia which is stronger than the effect of temperature. 4. Comparisons of pigment levels and lake characteristics were used to identify physical and biological factors associated with ephippial pigmentation. Investment in ephippial production was the strongest predictor with darker ephippia occurring more often in lakes with the highest ephippial production.																	0046-5070					NOV	2003	48	11					1971	1982		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.01136.x								WOS:000186119300004						
J	Benson, J; Van Driesche, RG; Pasquale, A; Elkinton, J				Benson, J; Van Driesche, RG; Pasquale, A; Elkinton, J			Introduced braconid parasitoids and range reduction of a native butterfly in New England	BIOLOGICAL CONTROL												Pieris napi oleracea Harris is a native pierid butterfly that has suffered a range reduction in New England that began after the invasion of its range by the non-native congener Pieris rapae L. and one of its braconid parasitoids, Cotesia glomerata (L.). P. napi has nearly disappeared from Massachusetts, but remains common in northern Vermont. We investigated food plant abundance and Cotesia spp. larval parasitism as possible factors to explain the historical changes in P. napi's distribution. We found that the current range of P. napi was not explained by the abundance of its key first generation food plant (two-leafed toothwort, Cardamine diphylla [Michx.]). We also found that levels of Cotesia spp. parasitism in meadows in the second generation were similar in Vermont and Massachusetts. Further, we found that both C glomerata and the related introduced Pieris spp. parasitoid Cotesia rubecula (Marshall) forage for hosts predominantly in sunny meadows and not in woods, where the first generation of P. napi occurs. We found that under field conditions in meadow habitats, C glomerata parasitizes P. napi at higher rates than P. rapae. We postulate that the persistence of P. napi in Vermont and its disappearance in Massachusetts is caused by high parasitism of the second generation by C glomerata in meadow habitats, coupled with a north-south cline in the rate of commitment of first generation P. napi pupae to diapause, such that northern populations act functionally as univoltine species developing in a parasitoid free habitat (woods), while southern populations acted as a bivoltine species and went extinct due to low survival in the second generation in meadows due to C glomerata parasitism.

J	Bradshaw, WE; Quebodeaux, MC; Holzapfel, CM				Bradshaw, WE; Quebodeaux, MC; Holzapfel, CM			The contribution of an hourglass timer to the evolution of photoperiodic response in the pitcher-plant mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii	EVOLUTION												Photoperiodism, the ability to assess the length of day or night, enables a diverse array of plants, birds, mammals, and arthropods to organize their development and reproduction in concert with the changing seasons in temperate climatic zones. For more than 60 years, the mechanism controlling photoperiodic response has been debated. Photoperiodism may be a simple interval timer, that is, an hourglasslike mechanism that literally measures the length of day or night or, alternatively, may be an overt expression of an underlying circadian oscillator. Herein, we test experimentally whether the rhythmic response in Wyeomyia smithii indicates a causal, necessary relationship between circadian rhythmicity and the evolutionary modification of photoperiodic response over the climatic gradient of North America, or may be explained by a simple interval timer. We show that a day-interval timer is sufficient to predict the photoperiodic response of W. smithii over this broad geographic range and conclude that rhythmic responses observed in classical circadian-based experiments alone cannot be used to infer a causal role for circadian rhythmicity in the evolution of photoperiodic time measurement. More importantly, we argue that the pursuit of circadian rhythmicity as the central mechanism that measures the duration of night or day has distracted researchers from consideration of the interval-timing processes that may actually be the target of natural selection linking internal photoperiodic time measurement to the external seasonal environment.																	0014-3820					OCT	2003	57	10					2342	2349										WOS:000186410300014	14628922					
J	Stefanescu, C; Penuelas, J; Filella, I				Stefanescu, C; Penuelas, J; Filella, I			Effects of climatic change on the phenology of butterflies in the northwest Mediterranean Basin	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Phenological changes in response to climatic warming have been detected across a wide range of organisms. Butterflies stand out as one of the most popular groups of indicators of climatic change, given that, firstly, they are poikilothermic and, secondly, have been the subject of thorough monitoring programmes in several countries for a number of decades. Here we provide for the first time strong evidence of phenological change as a consequence of recent climatic warming in butterflies at a Spanish site in the northwest Mediterranean Basin. By means of the widely used Butterfly Monitoring Scheme methodology, three different phenological parameters were analysed for the most common species to test for trends over time and relationships with temperature and precipitation. Between 1988 and 2002, there was a tendency for earlier first appearance dates in all 17 butterfly species tested, and significant advances in mean flight dates in 8 out of 19 species. On the other hand, the shape of the curve of adult emergence did not show any regular pattern. These changes paralleled an increase of 1 - 1.5 degreesC in mean February, March and June temperatures. Likewise, a correlation analysis indicated the strong negative effect of spring temperature on phenological parameters (i.e. higher temperatures tended to produce phenological advances), and the opposite effect of precipitation in certain months. In addition, there was some evidence to indicate that phenological responses may differ between taxonomic lineages or species with similar diets. We discuss the consequences that these changes may have on species' population abundances, especially given the expected increase in aridity in the Mediterranean Basin caused by current climatic warming. We predict that varying degrees of phenological flexibility may account for differences in species' responses and, for multivoltine species, predict strong selection favouring local seasonal adaptations such as diapause phenomena or migratory behaviour.

J	Shintani, Y; Munyiri, FN; Ishikawa, Y				Shintani, Y; Munyiri, FN; Ishikawa, Y			Change in significance of feeding during larval development in the yellow-spotted longicorn beetle, Psacothea hilaris	JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY												Larvae of the west-Japan type yellow-spotted longicorn beetle, Psacothea hilaris (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), show a long-day type photoperiodic response at 25 degreesC under long-day conditions, larvae pupate after the fourth or fifth instar, while under short-day conditions, they undergo a few nonstationary supernumerary molts and eventually enter diapause. In the present study, the effect of food on the development and photoperiodic response of the larvae was examined with special reference to molting and pupation. Although the pupal body size was greatly affected by the food quality and the length of feeding, the critical day length for induction of metamorphosis at 25 degreesC was always between 13.5 and 14 h. Exposure to starvation of larvae reared on the standard diet revealed that the capability to pupate is acquired after a few days of feeding in the fourth instar. In the larvae that had acquired the capability to pupate, premature pupation was induced by exposure to starvation, indicating that feeding becomes dispensable long before it is normally terminated.

J	Almeida, RPP; Purcell, AH				Almeida, RPP; Purcell, AH			Homalodisca coagulata (Hemiptera, Cicadellidae) transmission of Xylella fastidiosa to almond	PLANT DISEASE												Almond leaf scorch (ALS) is caused by the bacterium Xylella fastidiosa, transmitted by sharpshooter leafhoppers and spittlebugs. The recent invasion of a X. fastidiosa vector, Homalodisca coagulata (Hemiptera, Cicadellidae), into California may have major consequences to the spread of ALS because this insect feeds readily on trees, including stone fruit species. We found that, under laboratory conditions, H. coagulata acquired X. fastidiosa from symptomatic almond plants with low efficiency relative to grape (3.3 to 10% per individual per day). Inoculation efficiency also was low, approximately 4% per insect per day. H. coagulata inoculated 1-year-old woody tissues of almond plants at similar rates as green shoots. H. coagulata transmitted two fastidiosa grape strains from grape source plants to grape and almond. We also observed X. fastidiosa transmission to dormant almond plants. X. fastidiosa populations in the petioles of field-collected symptomatic almond leaves were not higher than 10(7) CFU/g of tissue, suggesting that low bacterial populations within almond are partially responsible for the lower acquisition rates observed from diseased almond compared with diseased grape, which are usually within the range of 10(8) to 10(9) CFU/g. The relevance of our findings to ALS epidemiology, considering H. coagulata as a vector, is discussed.

J	Zonneveld, BJM; Grimshaw, JM; Davis, AP				Zonneveld, BJM; Grimshaw, JM; Davis, AP			The systematic value of nuclear DNA content in Galanthus	PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION												Genome size (Cx-value) was applied as a new criterion to investigate the relationships within the genus Galanthus L. (Amaryllidaceae). More than 150 samples representing all species, from wild and cultivated material, were investigated. Most species of Galanthus have the same basic chromosome number (2n=2x=24). However, the somatic nuclear DNA contents (2C), as measured by flow cytometry with propidium iodide was shown to range from 48.6 to 90.4 pg for the diploids. This implies that the largest genome contains roughly 4x10(10) more base pairs than the smallest and has chromosomes that are nearly twice as large. On this basis we assumed that nuclear DNA content as measured using flow cytometry may be used to produce easily obtainable systematic data. Triploidy in G. rizehensis and G. alpinus var. bortkewitschianus, tetraploidy in G. elwesii and hexaploidy in G. lagodechianus were confirmed by flow cytometry. In addition, as well as a number of polyploid cultivars, triploids were also found in G. nivalis and tetraploids and hexaploids in G. transcaucasicus and G. elwesii, respectively. DNA content confirmed the close relationships in some species pairs, including: G. nivalis and G. reginae-olgae, G. krasnovii and G. platyphyllus, G. gracilis and G. elwesii. Further investigation of the taxonomic status of these pairs is suggested. As a rapid diagnostic tool, applicable even in the case of dormant bulbs or sterile plants, flow cytometry has applications for conservation and in particular the monitoring of the trade in bulbous plants.																	0378-2697					OCT	2003	241	1-2					89	102		10.1007/s00606-003-0016-z								WOS:000186375300008

Here, we report evidence suggesting a surprising source of genetic variation contributing to sympatric host shifts for these flies. From DNA sequence data for three nuclear loci and mtDNA, we infer that an ancestral, hawthorn-infesting R. pomonella population became geographically subdivided into Mexican and North American isolates approximate to1.57 million years ago. Episodes of gene flow from Mexico subsequently infused the North American population with inversion polymorphism affecting key diapause traits, forming adaptive clines. Sometime later (perhaps +/-1 million years), diapause variation in the latitudinal clines appears to have aided North American flies in adapting to a variety of plants with differing fruiting times, helping to spawn several new taxa. Thus, important raw genetic material facilitating the adaptive radiation of R. pomonella originated in a different time and place than the proximate ecological host shifts triggering sympatric divergence.																	0027-8424					SEP 2	2003	100	18					10314	10319		10.1073/pnas.1730757100								WOS:000185119300034	12928500

(i) As predicted, increased temperatures increased foraging activity and growth rates, but in contrast with the prediction, late photoperiod (high time stress) did not affect foraging activity and growth rate. (ii) Unexpectedly, the increase in growth rate at increasing temperatures was not larger under high time stress. (iii) As predicted, age and size at emergence decreased at higher temperatures and at the late photoperiod. Temperature-induced life history shifts were direct or the result of behavioural growth mediation depending on the temperature range. Photoperiod-induced life history shifts were direct. (iv) As predicted, males emerged before females but at a smaller size. The degree of sexual size dimorphism was influenced by the joint effects of temperature and photoperiod. We could only detect genetic variation in size plasticity to photoperiod. The match between the sex-specific life history responses to temperature and photoperiod and predictions by relevant optimality models suggests adaptive life history plasticity to these variables.																	1010-061X	1420-9101				SEP	2003	16	5					986	995		10.1046/j.1420-9101.2003.00581.x								WOS:000185203300022	14635914					
J	Perles, SJ; Christian, AD; Berg, DJ				Perles, SJ; Christian, AD; Berg, DJ			Vertical migration, orientation, aggregation, and fecundity of the freshwater mussel Lampsilis siliquoidea	OHIO JOURNAL OF SCIENCE												The decline in freshwater mussels makes it imperative that more information be gathered on their population status, behavior, and habitat requirements. We examined vertical migration, aggregation, and reproductive potential of captive and field populations of Lampsilis siliquoidea. Both captive populations and a field population exhibited vertical migration. This movement was strongly correlated with day length, and somewhat less strongly correlated with water temperature. While captive mussels tended to orient their siphons into the current, no pattern of orientation was detected in the field population. The field population was significantly aggregated in the fall and winter. The spatial patterning of captive mussels was random in the fall and winter, but this result may have been an artifact of the small size of the artificial streams. Weather conditions prevented data collection in the spring and, therefore, no conclusions could be drawn about the relationship between aggregation and glochidia release. The average number of glochidia (parasitic larvae) produced by individuals across a limited size range was not correlated with any maternal or marsupial properties. These results are useful for implementing qualitative sampling methods under optimum conditions and for information on the reproductive potential of Lampsilis siliquoidea.																	0030-0950					SEP	2003	103	4					73	78										WOS:000186051400002						
J	Staples, JF; Webber, DM; Boutilier, RG				Staples, JF; Webber, DM; Boutilier, RG			Environmental hypoxia does not constrain the diurnal depth distribution of free-swimming Nautilus pompilius	PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL ZOOLOGY												The behaviour of Nautilus pompilius swimming freely in a controlled mesocosm (tower tank, 4 m diameter x 10.5 m deep) was monitored using ultrasonic depth telemetry. Initially depths were monitored in water equilibrated with air. Then the bottom 3.5 m were rendered hypoxic (PO2 <20 mmHg) and depths monitored again. A thermocline at 7-m depth (17&DEG;C below, 20&DEG;C above) prevented mixing with the top, normoxic water. Mean depth was significantly greater during the light phase (8.9 m) of the 12L : 12D photoperiod than the dark phase (5.6 m), but this was not affected by hypoxia. During the light phase animals preferred the bottom 2.5 m of the tank but showed no specific preference for any depth range during the dark phase. Hypoxia did not alter these patterns of depth preference, though one animal made regular excursions toward normoxic water during the light phase. Vertical swimming activity was almost twofold greater during the dark phase and was not affected by hypoxia. These data suggest that, at least over the short term, Nautilus are not constrained from entering areas with low dissolved oxygen. This hypoxia tolerance may be attributed to the large onboard oxygen stores and suppressed metabolism during hypoxia.																	1522-2152					SEP-OCT	2003	76	5					644	651		10.1086/376428								WOS:000187514400005	14671712

As a result, migratory birds returning from tropical wintering sites may arrive too late to take full advantage of the food resources on their breeding grounds. Under these conditions, selection will favour earlier spring arrival that could be achieved by overwintering closer to the breeding grounds. However, it is unknown how daylength conditions at higher latitudes will affect the timing of life cycle stages. Here, we show in three species of Palaearctic-African migratory songbirds that a shortening of migration distance induces an advancement of springtime activities. Birds exposed to daylengths simulating migration to and wintering in southern Europe considerably advanced their spring migratory activity and testicular development. This response to the novel photoperiodic environment will enable birds wintering further north to advance spring arrival and to start breeding earlier. Thus, phenotypic flexibility in response to the photoperiod may reinforce selection for shorter migration distance if spring temperatures continue to rise.

The responsiveness of males varied with age, increasing up to 3-days and then remaining constant to 7-days. In male responses to the pheromone throughout the scotophase tinder five different photoregimes, it was shown that the time to reach the maximal response level after lights-off was rather constant (ca. 4 h), regardless of the duration of the scotophase in a range from 6 to 18 h. The maximal response level in every case appeared to be maintained until the end of the scotophase. Furthermore, in the experiment involving +/-3 h shifts of lights-off or lights-on timing from the usual 15L:9D, the male responsiveness increased within 4 h after lights-off, and the maximal level extended throughout the remaining dark period. These results suggest that, at least under the present experimental conditions, only lights-off and lights-on cues are critical for the timing of the increase and decrease in responsiveness. No responsiveness was observed under light conditions, showing that light inhibits the responsiveness of males to sex pheromones.

Species that undertake regular two-way migration may be expected, through population connectivity, to exhibit some level of genetic similarity over broad spatial scales. Although seldom following two-way migration, highly mobile insect species tend to exhibit either low haplotype diversity and no phylogeographic structuring, or relatively high haplotype diversity and pronounced phylogeographic structuring. 2. This study reveals the first wide-scale genetic characterisation of a migratory dragonfly, the common green darner Anax junius Drury. Unusually for insects, north-south two-way migration is common in this species, although not obligatory. In at least part of its range, some individuals follow an extended developmental period and overwinter in a state of diapause. 3. Mitochondrial sequence data were obtained from 92 A. junius individuals collected from 35 sites across Canada, U.S.A., and Mexico. These revealed 38 haplotypes, some of which were extremely widespread, although the majority (27 haplotypes) was found in only one individual. In contrast to previous studies on mobile insects, the overall pattern was of relatively high haplotype diversity in the absence of phylogeographic structuring. 4. Migrants and non-migrants, which sometimes shared haplotypes, were distributed across multiple genetic lineages. This suggests that, contrary to some earlier assertions, developmental pathways in this species may be plastic. Such plasticity would allow highly mobile species to adapt to a range of environmental conditions, and may be key to the widespread distribution of multiple haplotypes.																	0307-6946					AUG	2003	28	4					413	421		10.1046/j.1365-2311.2003.00521.x								WOS:000184460700004						
J	Herzog, ED; Huckfeldt, RM				Herzog, ED; Huckfeldt, RM			Circadian entrainment to temperature, but not light, in the isolated suprachiasmatic nucleus	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY												The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the master pacemaker that drives circadian rhythms in mammalian physiology and behavior. The abilities to synchronize to daily cycles in the environment and to keep accurate time over a range of physiologic temperatures are two fundamental properties of circadian pacemakers. Recordings from a bioluminescent reporter (Per1-luc) of Period1 gene activity in rats showed that the cultured SCN entrained to daily, 1.5degreesC cycles of temperature, but did not synchronize to daily light cycles. Temperature entrainment developed by 1 day after birth. Light cycles failed to affect the isolated SCN of rats aged 2 to 339 days. Entrainment to a 3-h shift in the warm-cool cycle was possible in <3 days with 3 &DEG;C cycles. Importantly, Per1-luc expression in vitro was similar to that seen in vivo where peak expression occurs approximately 1 h prior to the daily increase in temperature. In addition, the firing rate of individual mouse SCN neurons continued to express near 24-h rhythms from 24 - 37 &DEG;C. At lower temperatures, the percentage of rhythmic cells was reduced, but periodicity was temperature compensated. The results indicate that normal rhythms in brain temperature may serve to stabilize rhythmicity of the circadian system in vivo and that temperature compensation of this period is determined at the level of individual SCN cells.

But the evolutionary significance of their deciduous character has remained a matter of conjecture for almost a century(3). The leading hypothesis(1,4-7) argues that it was an adaptation to photoperiod, allowing the avoidance of carbon losses by respiration from a canopy of leaves unable to photosynthesize in the darkness of warm polar winters(8-11). Here we test this proposal with experiments using 'living fossil' tree species grown in a simulated polar climate with and without CO2 enrichment. We show that the quantity of carbon lost annually by shedding a deciduous canopy is significantly greater than that lost by evergreen trees through wintertime respiration and leaf litter production, irrespective of growth CO2 concentration. Scaling up our experimental observations indicates that the greater expense of being deciduous persists in mature forests, even up to latitudes of 83 degreesN, where the duration of the polar winter exceeds five months. We therefore reject the carbon-loss hypothesis as an explanation for the deciduous nature of polar forests.

Early populations in the USA, believed derived from temperate Japan, all possessed a photoperiodically inducible egg diapause, but a population from Brazil, of probable tropical origins, did not. Based on responses of geographic populations to a common short (10L:14D) day length, we demonstrate that the spread of A. albopictus in Florida from more temperate USA has been associated with a gradual loss of diapause, such that diapause incidence is now positively correlated with latitude in the southern USA. In Brazil, most populations tested 15 yr after the initial invasion show no evidence of diapause, except for three from the two southernmost states (>26degreesS), in which a small, but significant percentage of eggs from mothers exposed to short day lengths were dormant. Diapause reduction in the southern USA and diapause acquisition by A. albopictus in southern Brazil have not resulted in similar response levels at comparable latitudes in the two countries, in part because of genetic constraints of different founder populations from temperate and tropical origins and different selective regimes in the two invaded countries.																	0013-8746					JUL	2003	96	4					512	518		10.1603/0013-8746(2003)096[0512:AEOPDI]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000184762000012

A wildfire in April 1999 provided an opportunity to study the effect of season and intensity of post-burn defoliation on foothills rough fescue (F. campestris Rydb.) in southwestern Alberta. A 3 (date of defoliation) x 2 (defoliation intensity) factorial experiment with 10 replicates (plants) was established in both a burned and a non-burned grassland and analyzed as a nested design. Plants were defoliated once during active vegetative growth (17 May), inflorescence development (2 July), or dormancy (30 September), at either 5 or 15-cm clipped stubble heights in the first growing season after fire. Burning increased tiller numbers by 54% compared to non-burned plants but reduced plant ANPP by 51% in the second growing season. While a single defoliation of burned plants, particularly early in the year, had little effect on growth, delaying defoliation into July decreased tillers 1 year later. Increasing defoliation intensity had the greatest impact on non-burned plants, reducing plant height (15%) as well as tiller (21%) and plant (32%) ANPP in the second year. May defoliation reduced etiolated growth 1 year later regardless of burn treatment. A single grazing event after wildfire does not necessarily appear to detrimentally affect rough fescue; however, the low herbage available immediately after fire may not justify the increased risk to the plant with subsequent grazing.																	0022-409X					JUL	2003	56	4					375	381		10.2307/4004042								WOS:000184011400011

Occasionally, hybridization between an introduced species and another species (introduced or native) can result in interspecific gene flow. This may occur even in instances where the F, hybrid shows very high sterility, but occasionally produces a few viable gametes. We provide examples of gene flow occurring between some rhododendrons recently introduced to the British flora, and between an introduced and native Senecio species. Neutral molecular markers have normally been employed to obtain evidence of interspecific gene flow, but the challenge now is to isolate and characterize functional introgressed genes and to determine how they affect the fitness of introgressants and whether they improve adaptation to novel habitats allowing introgressants to expand the range of a species. We outline a candidate gene approach for isolating and characterizing an allele of the PAY gene in Senecio vulgaris, which is believed to have introgressed from S. squalidus, and which causes the production of ray florets in flower heads. We discuss the effects of this introgressed allele on individual fitness, including those that originate directly from the production of ray florets plus those that may arise from pleiotropy and/or linkage.

The first was a field group, the second was a lab control group that received natural temperature/photoperiod conditions, and the third was an experimental lab group that received temperature/photoperiod conditions of a region north of the current range limit. The field and lab control groups exhibited a single testosterone peak in August (34.4 and 14.1 ng ml(-1), respectively) that coincided with observed reproductive activities in Northwestern Arkansas. The experimental group also exhibited a single peak (11.7 ng ml(-1)), but the peak was delayed by one month. We coupled energetic calculations with environmental temperature, the timing of reproductive events, and the time available for foraging to demonstrate how pre- and postcopulation reproductive failure may serve as a sublethal range-limiting mechanism. North of their current range limit, the reduced time for energy acquisition may not allow for sufficient juvenile recruitment into the population to replace losses. Therefore, cottonmouths may be prevented from establishing a more northern range limit due to their reproductive physiology.																	0045-8511	1938-5110				JUN 23	2003		2					231	240		10.1643/0045-8511(2003)003[0231:TCAREI]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000183817700001

(Hym.: Trichogrammatidae) in Northern Switzerland. Eggs of six host species parasitized by T. brassicae were exposed under outdoor conditions every two weeks between 26 September and 7 November 1998. We found that T. brassicae is able to overwinter successfully on six lepidopteran species in the families Tortricidae, Noctuidae, Plutellidae, Pyralidae and Crambidae. Between 75 and 100% emergence was observed in the following spring for all of the six tested host species exposed on 26 September. On later exposure dates, spring emergence decreased significantly and no development of T. brassicae offspring occurred from host eggs parasitized on 7 November. Emergence of T. brassicae from eggs of Ephestia kuehniella Zeller parasitized at weekly intervals in autumn 1999 occurred in the same year until the end of October if the eggs were parasitized by 10 September. All offspring from eggs that were parasitized from 17 September onwards went into diapause. Spring emergence of T. brassicae adults was observed between end of April and beginning of May both in 1999 and 2000. Fecundity of T. brassicae females that overwintered on E. kuehniella was not significantly different from the fecundity of control females that were reared without diapause under optimal conditions at 25degreesC. Our results demonstrate that the egg parasitoid T. brassicae is able to overwinter successfully in Northern Switzerland and has the potential to establish in Switzerland. As a result, potential non-target effects are not locally restricted but may occur on a large geographical scale.																	1386-6141					JUN	2003	48	3					261	273		10.1023/A:1023661420247								WOS:000182608200002

Laricobius nigrinus is a candidate biological control agent of the hemlock woolly adelgid, Adelges tsugae Annand (Homoptera: Adelgidae), an exotic pest on eastern (Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carriere) and Carolina (T. caroliniana Engelmann) hemlocks in the eastern United States. It is univoltine and undergoes an aestival diapause. Post-aestivation activity period was 36.6 and 30.8 weeks for males and females, respectively. Adult activity and oviposition are well synchronized with the over-wintering generation of A. tsugae. Mean lifetime fecundity was 100.8 eggs over a mean duration of 13.2 weeks oviposition period. Within the temperature range (12-18 degreesC) studied, development was fastest at 18 degreesC. Mean development time from egg to adult was 88.8, 64.8 and 46.6 days at 12, 15 and 18 degreesC, respectively. Laricobius nigrinus has four larval instars. Mean larval consumption was 225.9 and 252.3 A. tsugae eggs at 12 and 18 degreesC, respectively. These findings provide essential data on the rate of development and feeding capacity of L. nigrinus at temperatures typical of ambient conditions during late winter/early spring in Virginia. Its rapid development at 18 degreesC indicates that it has potential as a biological control agent of A. tsugae because of its synchrony with the development of the over-wintering generation of A. tsugae in eastern United States.

All three instars are black, the 2nd with an indistinct, and the 3rd with a distinct yellowish lateral stripe; full-grown larvae reach ca. 9 mm in length and pupate in cells in litter on the ground or a few cm below the soil surface. Adults are yellowish with two dark brown stripes on each elytron. Duration of the egg averaged 5 days, 1st instar 4.9 days, 2nd instar 4.8 days, 3rd instar 7.4 days, prepupa 4.8 days, and pupa 7.1 days at 24.1 degreesC. Preoviposition averaged 3.9 days and an average female oviposited over a 12-day period and laid 194 eggs. Degree-day accumulations for development were 234.2 for the three larval instars and 91.3 for the pupa above a developmental threshold of 12.5degreesC. Net reproductive rate (R(0)) in the laboratory at 28.6degreesC and on the best Tamarix accession was calculated at 88, generation time at 37 days, and innate capacity of increase (r(m)) at 0.112, giving a population doubling time of 6.2 days. In field cages in Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, Nevada, and California, overwintering adults emerged from late April to early May. Adults of the first generation emerged in early to mid-July, and 2nd generation adults emerged from mid-August to early September and overwintered. High populations of larvae developing in field cages caused defoliation, dieback, and sometimes death of the Tamarty trees. At the three study sites in Texas, maximum daylength was 14h 21 min and larvae exposed to these conditions produced adults in reproductive diapause early in the season and subsequently failed to overwinter. North of 38degrees latitude in the United States, populations of D. e. deserticola originating from Fukang, China and Chilik, Kazakhstan are active throughout the growing season, successfully overwinter, and are potentially a highly effective control agent for saltcedar.

Studies on the biology and temperature requirements of C. arcuatus were made under laboratory and field (cage) conditions. In the laboratory, insects were reared on soybean plants in incubators held at 18, 20, 22, 25, 28, 30, or 32degreesC, 70 +/- 10% RH, and a photoperiod of 14:10 (L:D) h. A degree-days (DD) model developed based on the incubator data were validated in the field based on air and soil temperatures. The duration of the egg, larva-to-adult, and egg-to-adult period was inversely correlated with the temperature within the range of 18-32degreesC, with the highest viability found from 20 to 30degreesC. The temperature threshold for development and the thermal constant for the egg phase and the larva-to-adult periods were 13.6degreesC and 106.7 DD, 8.3degreesC and 399.4 DD, and 10.7degreesC and 489.0 DD, respectively. The DD model for the egg-to-adult period, calculated using constant temperatures in the laboratory, was found to be valid for populations of C. arcuatus in the field, based on the fluctuating air and soil temperatures, although air temperatures provided more precise predictions. These data provide support for the rational control of this pest through population predictions based on their temperature requirements.

J	Musolin, DL; Numata, H				Musolin, DL; Numata, H			Photoperiodic and temperature control of diapause induction and colour change in the southern green stink bug Nezara viridula	PHYSIOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												The effect of photoperiod and temperature on the duration of the nymphal period, diapause induction and colour change in adults of Nezara viridula (L.) (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae) from Japan was studied in the laboratory. At 20 degreesC, the developmental period for nymphs was significantly shorter under LD 10 : 14 h (short day) and LD 16 : 8 h (long day) than under intermediate photoperiods, whereas at 25 degreesC it was slightly shorter under intermediate than short- and long-day conditions. It is assumed that photoperiod-mediated acceleration of nymphal growth takes place in autumn when day-length is short and it is unlikely that nymphal development is affected by day-length under summer long-day and hot conditions. Nezara viridula has an adult diapause controlled by a long-day photoperiodic response. At 20 degreesC and 25 degreesC in both sexes, photoperiodic responses were similar and had thresholds close to 12.5 h, thus suggesting that the response is thermostable within this range of temperatures and day-length plays a leading role in diapause induction. Precopulation and preoviposition periods were significantly longer under near-critical regimes than under long-day ones. Short-day and near-critical photoperiods induced a gradual change of adult colour from green to brown/russet. The rate of colour change was significantly higher under LD 10 : 14 h than under LD 13 : 11 h, suggesting that the colour change is strongly associated with diapause induction. The incidences of diapause or dark colour did not vary among genetically determined colour morphs, indicating that these morphs have a similar tendency to enter diapause and change colour in response to short-day conditions.

AMERICAN NATURALIST												Many plants and animals use the length of day or photoperiod to cue their seasonal patterns of development, reproduction, dormancy, and migration. Among temperate arthropods, the median or critical photoperiod increases with latitude or altitude. Concomitantly, in beetles, moths, mites, flies, and mosquitoes, there is a declining expression of a rhythmic, presumably circadian-based, component of photoperiodic response. It has been proposed that the long summer days in the north select for a reduced response to light by the circadian clock, which results in this declining rhythmic expression and, consequently, longer northern critical photoperiods. However, these patterns might also be due to direct, seasonal selection on the critical photoperiod itself, which results in a correlated reduction in the rhythmic component as a result of internal physiological constraints within the organism. Using standard light duration and selection experiments, we show that evolution of photoperiodic time measurement in the mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii, results from the direct response of critical photoperiod to seasonal selection and a correlated response of the rhythmic component of photoperiodic time measurement. We conclude that expression of the circadian clock is necessary neither for the central mechanism of photoperiodic time measurement nor for the adaptive modification of critical photoperiod.																	0003-0147					MAY	2003	161	5					735	748		10.1086/374344								WOS:000183276900004	12858281

Only non-diapausing adults were found in Hokkaido, northern Japan, whereas diapausing adults were observed at most sites in Honshu and southward in summer. However, the non-diapausing adults were also observed in northern Honshu and at high-altitudinal sites of central Honshu. The frequency of diapause expression in northern Honshu varied greatly among populations and years. The frequency of non-diapausing adults was significantly higher when average daily mean air temperature for July was relatively low. This indicated that the populations inhabiting northern Honshu have plasticity in diapause induction, primarily in response to temperature conditions. Moreover, the coexistence of diapausing adults and non-diapausing adults at the same site was often observed. This suggested that there might be genetic variation in diapause tendency within a local population.																	0003-6862					MAY	2003	38	2					187	196										WOS:000183990500004

This study compares the diapause characteristics of populations of these two species from Taiwan with those from Kagoshima (southern Japan) and the Okinawa islands (southwestern islands). Our previous study (Takafuji et al., 2001, Appl. Entomol. Zool. 36: 177-184) showed that most T kanzawai populations from Kagoshima exhibited more than 90% diapause at 15degreesC-9L15D, but the incidence of diapause in populations from the Okinawa islands was very low, and some exhibited no diapause even at 15degreesC. The present study shows that populations from central Taiwan, including those from the lowlands, exhibited a lower incidence of diapause than populations from Kagoshima, but a higher incidence than populations from the Okinawa islands. These results imply that the gene flow among populations in the lowlands and mountains maintains a higher incidence of diapause in Taiwan, but the diapause characteristic may have been eliminated by warm temperatures on the Okinawa islands, on which there are no high mountains. On the other hand, all populations of T urticae from Kagoshima, Okinawa and Taiwan similarly exhibited a very low incidence of diapause.

J	Bennett, VA; Lee, RE; Nauman, JS; Kukal, O				Bennett, VA; Lee, RE; Nauman, JS; Kukal, O			Selection of overwintering microhabitats used by the Arctic woollybear caterpillar, Gynaephora groenlandica	CRYOLETTERS												In extreme envirorments such as the High Arctic, climatic conditions challenge physiological tolerance of insects resulting in prolonged dormancy and extended life cycles. Therefore, the selection of suitable microhabitats for overwintering is crucial. At two field sites on Ellesmere Island, we located hibernacula (silk overwintering structures) used by the Arctic woollybear caterpillar, Gynaephora groenlandica (Wocke) (Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae) during their 11 month dormancy. All hibernacula found were anchored to the base of rocks and were not associated with vegetation. Rocks may function to absorb solar radiation and re-radiate heat, accelerating localized snowmelt, thus allowing caterpillars to emerge as early as possible in spring to begin foraging. Temperatures experienced by G. groenlandica in hibernacula throughout the winter were well within their physiological tolerance range. During late summer aestivation, hibernaculum temperatures were similar to, but more stable than, nearby soil surface temperatures. Lower maximum daily hibernaculum temperatures during the warmest month (July) may reduce metabolic rates and provide some energy savings. Since hibernacula were not randomly distributed around rocks, this suggests that G. groenlandica key in on some feature of the hibernaculum site. The northeast orientation of hibernacula at Eastwind Lake corresponds to the leeward side of rocks. Therefore wind patterns may be important in hibernaculum site selection. Other potential cues that may guide selection of hibernacula sites remain unclear: no seasonal changes in preference for light or soil moisture were observed between active and dormant caterpillars, and thermotaxis could not be distinguished from thigmotaxis.																	0143-2044					MAY-JUN	2003	24	3					191	200										WOS:000184349000008	12908029

We conducted population-based active surveillance for all cases of invasive pneumococcal disease in seven states; plotted annualized weekly rates by geographic location, age, and latitude; and assessed correlations by time-series analysis. In all geographic areas, invasive pneumococcal disease exhibited a distinct winter seasonality, including an increase among children in the fall preceding that for adults and a sharp spike in incidence among adults each year between December 24 and January 7. Pneumococcal disease correlated inversely with temperature (r -0.82 with a 1-week lag; p < 0.0001), but paradoxically the coldest states had the lowest rates, and no threshold temperature could be identified. The pattern of disease correlated directly with the sinusoidal variations in photoperiod (r +0.85 with a 5-week lag; p < 0.0001). Seemingly unrelated seasonal phenomena were also somewhat correlated. The reproducible seasonal patterns in varied geographic locations are consistent with the hypothesis that nationwide seasonal changes such as photoperiod-dependent variation in host susceptibility may underlie pneumococcal seasonality, but caution is indicated in assigning causality as a result of such correlations.																	1080-6040					MAY	2003	9	5					573	579		10.3201/eid0905.020556								WOS:000182569700010	12737741					
J	Cope, DR				Cope, DR			Variation in daily and seasonal foraging routines of non-breeding barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis): working harder does not overcome environmental constraints	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												This study describes the changes in stored body fat in Svalbard barnacle geese Branta leucopsis over the non-breeding period, and uses behavioural patterns to explain the variation in body fat stores. It was predicted that foraging effort would: (1) increase at low food densities; (2) increase when days were short; (3) decrease in smaller flocks; (4) be bimodally distributed throughout the day for long days, but constant for short days. Time constraints were found to be the major driving force behind foraging decisions during the shortest days of mid-winter, whereas food density was found to drive decisions during longer days. Field observations of fat stores showed that fat was rapidly accumulated at the start and end of the non-breeding period, but that fat stores remained constant during mid-winter. It is suggested that day length prevented a positive fat storage rate in mid-winter through the limitation of foraging time, even though foraging effort was high during this period. During a single day, evidence for a bimodal foraging routine was found, where feeding activity was concentrated in the early morning and late afternoon periods. This pattern was found in the full range of day lengths, which suggests that even for short days, feeding must be interrupted so that other essential activities can be conducted. It is concluded that the behavioural choices of barnacle geese were constrained by environmental conditions, and that these behavioural patterns allow the variation in fat stores to be explained.																	0952-8369					MAY	2003	260		1				65	71		10.1017/S0952836903003509								WOS:000183462900007						
J	Garcia-Gil, MR; Mikkonen, M; Savolainen, O				Garcia-Gil, MR; Mikkonen, M; Savolainen, O			Nucleotide diversity at two phytochrome loci along a latitudinal cline in Pinus sylvestris	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Forest tree species provide many examples of well-studied adaptive differentiation, where the search for the underlying genes might be possible. In earlier studies and in our common conditions in a greenhouse, northern populations set bud earlier than southern ones. A difference in latitude of origin of one degree corresponded to a change of 1.4 days in number of days to terminal bud set of seedlings. Earlier physiological and ecological genetics work in conifers and other plants have suggested that such variation could be governed by phytochromes. Nucleotide variation was examined at two phytochrome loci (PHYP and PHYO, homologues of the Arabidopsis thaliana PHYB and PHYA , respectively) in three populations: northern Finland, southern Finland and northern Spain. In our samples of 12-15 sequences (2980 and 1156 base pairs at the two loci) we found very low nonsynonymous variation; pi was 0.0003 and 0.0002 at PHYP and PHYO loci, respectively. There was no functional differentiation between populations at the photosensory domains of either locus. The overall silent variation was also low, only 0.0024 for the PHYP locus. The low estimates of silent variation are consistent with the estimated low synonymous substitution rates between Pinus sylvestris and Picea abies at the PHYO locus. Despite the low level of nucleotide variation, haplotypic diversity was relatively high (0.42 and 0.41 for fragments of 1156 nucleotides) at the two loci.																	0962-1083					MAY	2003	12	5					1195	1206		10.1046/j.1365-294X.2003.01826.x								WOS:000182261500009	12694283

As a consequence, seasonal variation in day length may represent an ecological constraint on behaviour, since short winter days restrict the length of the time available for foraging in diurnal species (with long summer days, and thus short nights, a potential constraint for nocturnal species). This paper examines monthly variation in activity patterns over a 4-year study of chacma baboons (Papio cynocephalus ursinus) at De Hoop Nature Reserve, South Africa. Time spent feeding, moving, grooming and resting are all significant positive functions of day length, even before chance events such as disease epidemics and climatically mediated home range shifts have been accounted for. These results provide strong support for the idea that day length acts as an ecological constraint by limiting the number of daylight hours and thus restricting the active period at certain times of year. Day length variation also has important implications across populations. Interpopulation variation in resting time, and non-foraging activity in general, is a positive function of latitude, with long summer days at temperate latitudes apparently producing an excess of time that cannot profitably be devoted to additional foraging or social activity. However, it is the short winter days that are probably of greatest importance, since diurnal animals must still fulfil their foraging requirements despite the restricted number of daylight hours and elevated thermoregulatory requirements at this time of year. Ultimately this serves to restrict the maximum ecologically tolerable group sizes of baboon populations with increasing distance from the equator. Seasonal variation in day length is thus an important ecological constraint on animal behaviour that has important implications both within and between populations, and future studies at non-equatorial latitudes must clearly be mindful of its importance.

J	Jing, XH; Kang, L				Jing, XH; Kang, L			Geographical variation in egg cold hardiness: a study on the adaptation strategies of the migratory locust Locusta migratoria L.	ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												1. For many species of insect, cold hardiness is an important trait that enables a population to develop in the next season and to extend its range. To elucidate the role of cold hardiness of the migratory locust Locusta migratoria L. in its outbreak and distribution areas, egg cold hardiness was examined in locusts derived from four locations from latitude 18degrees23'N to latitude 41degrees10'N in eastern China. 2. The supercooling points of eggs from different geographic populations did not differ significantly for the first development stage, with an average +/- SE of -24.5 +/- 0.51degreesC, or for the second stage, -22.06 +/- 0.68 degreesC, however there was a significant difference for the embryonic development phase among the four geographical populations. The egg supercooling point increased gradually from neonatal egg to old egg; eggs prior to hatching always had a much higher supercooling point. 3. Comparisons of the cold hardiness of four populations were carried out by validating the close correlation between latitude and the effects of cold on hatching, low lethal temperature (Ltemp(50)), and low lethal time (Ltime(50)). There were significant differences among the four populations; the northern population was more cold hardy than the southern population, and the two mid-latitude populations were intermediately cold hardy. 4. The cold hardiness of all populations was enhanced to various degrees by short-term cold acclimation at 0 degreesC and 5 degreesC. For most populations, a 2-day acclimation period seemed to be optimal.																	0307-6946					APR	2003	28	2					151	158		10.1046/j.1365-2311.2003.00497.x								WOS:000181831600004						
J	Kurota, H; Shimada, M				Kurota, H; Shimada, M			Geographical variation in photoperiodic induction of larval diapause in the bruchid beetle, Bruchidius dorsalis: polymorphism in overwintering stages	ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA												The bruchid beetle, Bruchidius dorsalis Fahraeus (Coleoptera: Bruchidae), has a multivoltine life cycle and shows geographical variation of overwintering stages in Japan. Our previous study found that B. dorsalis enters larval diapause in the final instar under short photoperiods. In cooler areas, we observed that most individuals overwinter in the final larval stage in diapause, whereas beetles at different developmental stages (non-diapausing young instars, diapausing instars, and adults) were overwintering in warmer areas. In this study, we investigated geographical variation in the photoperiodic response for induction of larval diapause at 20degreesC (three populations) and 24degreesC (two populations) to clarify the overwintering strategy of B. dorsalis. We observed that (1) diapause incidence at 20degreesC changed sharply from ca. 100% to 0% with a change in photoperiod in all the populations, (2) critical photoperiod was longer at 20degreesC in populations from cooler areas, and (3) critical photoperiod at 24degreesC was shorter than at 20degreesC and a fraction of the larvae did not enter diapause, even under short photoperiods. Overwintering stages estimated from these results were consistent with those actually observed in the field. This study indicates that the geographical variation of overwintering stages is likely to reflect adaptive diapause induction in each local environment.

J	Walsh, GC				Walsh, GC			Host range and reproductive traits of Diabrotica speciosa (Germar) and Diabrotica viridula (F.) (Coleoptera : Chrysomelidae), two species of South American pest rootworms, with notes on other species of Diabroticina	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												The reproductive biology, and larval and adult host rant e of Diabrotica speciosa (Germar), Diabrotica viridula (F.), Acalymma spp. (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Galerucinae), and other Diabroticina are described. These Diabroticina are pests of several crops in South and Central America. The adult feeding hosts are compared, among species, and within species in different seasons, Laboratory oviposition and larval development tests oil several hosts, provided the basis to construct a table of putative hosts, and general reproductive traits related to two species groups of Diabrotica (virgifera and fucata). Eggs of D. speciosa and D. viridula. were exposed to low temperatures to detect the ability to be dormant. Multivoltinism and lack of egg diapause was demonstrated for the three species, and field data suggest other South American species present the same traits. Diabrotica speciosa (fucata group) larvae developed well on maize (Zea mays I.). peanuts (Arachis hypogaea L.), and soybeans (Glycine max (L.) Merrill) roots, and not so well oil pumpkin (Cucurbita maxima Duchesne and Cucurbita andreana Naudin), beaus (Phaseolus spp.) and potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) roots. Oviposition preferences roughly paralleled larval suitability. but there was a clear preference for cucurbits as adult food, when a available pigweed (Amaranthus quitensis Knuth), sunflower (Ikhanthus annuus. L.), and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) were in second place. Diabrotica viridula (virgifera group), preferred maize as adult and larval food, and for oviposition. Acalymma spp.. were associated in every respect to cucurbits, Other species showed varying degrees of preference for oviposition and feeding, but in general. cucurbits were the preferred adult feeding hosts. Followed by several wild plants, and maize the preferred oviposition host. Whereas cucurbits A were consistently visited by the adults of every species, the virgifera group species ovipositioned and developed exclusively on Mono-cotyledonae, However, D, speciosa. as expected for a fucata group species ovipositcd and developed oil a wide range of hosts. This new knowledge oil South American Diabroticina is discussed in the context of the current knowledge oil North American Diabroticina, Differences and similarities are discussed in connection with their pestiferous status, and their potential for adaptation to new hosts.																	0046-225X					APR	2003	32	2					276	285		10.1603/0046-225X-32.2.276								WOS:000182354100006

We studied incidence of pheromone trap catch data, and combined this with previous work oil development and diapause to construct a comprehensive model of the temporal dynamics of E. viteana. We explored the behavior of this model fit six eastern United States locations along Lakes Erie and Michigan, the Finger Lakes in New York, and fit Missouri and Virginia. Voltinism of E. viteana is influenced by the accumulated growing degree lay's before the postsummer solstice photoperiod at which eggs develop exclusively into diapausing pupae. Our model generally predicted two full and a partial third generation it Geneva, NY, whereas partial fourth generations existed fit vineyards along Lakes Erie, and Michigan, In more southern latitudes, such as Missouri and Virginia, the absence of a partial fourth generation would be rare. Also, our model suggested the presence of clinal latitudinal variation in diapause induction with southern populations of E, viteana responding to shorter daylengths than northern populations. These predictions, based oil average 10-yr surface temperatures (1991-2000) are supported by past observations and explain the variability in voltinism front year to year that has been reported in the, northeastern it United States and Niagara Peninsula of Canada.

Here we study clonal variation in life-cycle characteristics of the cosmopolitan water plant Potamogeton pectinatus L. across a broad latitudinal range. Two consecutive experiments were performed under standardised laboratory conditions (photoperiod, irradiance and temperature). In the first experiment we investigated asexual reproduction among fifteen clones, obtained from latitudes ranging from 24 to 68degrees N. After 90 days of growth, high-latitude clones produced more but smaller tubers, while the aboveground biomass was lower as compared to the clones obtained from low latitudes. In a second experiment we studied inherent differences in early growth, morphology and photosynthesis for eleven clones (obtained from the same latitudinal range as in experiment 1). We found high among clonal variation for most measured variables, but the number of latitude-correlated traits was limited. The only trait that correlated with latitude was the number of leaves per plant, which increased in clones from higher latitudes. Our results agree with the hypothesis of a latitude-correlated switch in life-cycle strategy for this species. For northern clones this results in a short life-cycle, with an early and high investment in tuber biomass, while for low latitude clones the length of the life-cycle is prolonged, with a delayed reproduction and increased total plant biomass.

This species was initially recognized because of its unique song phenotype. Both sexes produce one type of song, characterized by a single very long volley averaging 4.5 s in duration and repeated every 9.5 s. The unit of exchange during heterosexual duets (the shortest repeated unit) is the single volley. The carrier frequency is upwardly, then downwardly, modulated during each volley. The maximum frequency is higher (around 110 Hz) than in other members of the carnea group. Each volley ends with an audible, percussive 'rattle'. Song features vary only slightly over a large geographical range that extends from northern Iran westward to the Azores and northward to southern Switzerland. Discriminant function analysis confirms the uniqueness of the C. agilis song in comparison with nine other song species. Morphologically, the adult of C. agilis is very similar to C. carnea and C. pallida and is generally intermediate between them with respect to the size of the pretarsal basal dilation, the shape of the genital lip and chin, the colour and type of setae on the abdomen, and colour markings on the head and mouthparts. No single feature will distinguish C. agilis from either C. carnea or C. pallida , but a suite of physical attributes can be used with reasonable success. Larval morphology fails to distinguish clearly C. agilis from other song species. Ecologically, C. agilis shares an affinity for low vegetation with C. lucasina and C. carnea , and a preference for milder, Mediterranean climates with C. mediterranea . Adults undergo a colour change to pale yellowish brown during winter diapause, and eggs are laid singly rather than in groups. Based on its ecological characteristics, C. agilis may prove to be an effective agent of biological control in the agricultural fields of warmer, drier parts of southern Europe and the Middle East, where other members of the carnea group are less common or absent.																	0307-6970					APR	2003	28	2					131	147		10.1046/j.1365-3113.2003.00208.x								WOS:000181968100001						
J	Hanula, JL; Wade, DD				Hanula, JL; Wade, DD			Influence of long-term dormant-season burning and fire exclusion on ground-dwelling arthropod populations in longleaf pine flatwoods ecosystems	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Frequent dormant-season prescribed bums were applied at 1-, 2- and 4-year intervals to longleaf pine stands, Pinus palustris, for over 40 years on the Osceola National Forest in Baker County, Florida. Control plots were unburned for the same period of time. Pitfall traps were operated from November 1994 to October 1999 to measure the short- and long-term effects of prescribed burning frequency on the relative abundance and diversity of ground-dwelling macroarthropods. We also measured dead and live plant biomass to determine how long-term frequent fires affected the structure of the forest floor. The average total dead plus live plant biomass was significantly higher on plots where fire had been excluded. Annual and biennial burning resulted in about the same amount of total plant biomass (dead and live plant material combined) which was significantly less than the quadrennially burned plots. Shannon diversity (Y) and evenness of ground-dwelling arthropods were reduced by burning. Annually burned plots had the lowest diversity and evenness while biennially and quadrennially burned plots also were significantly lower than unburned control plots. Dormant-season burning did not increase the number of rare genera regardless of frequency. Percent similarity of arthropod communities was highest for comparisons between plots that had been burned (60-68%) and lowest for the comparison of annually burned plots to unburned controls (37%). Examination of diversity and similarity through time showed that changes were due to short-term effects caused by the application of fire and not long-term changes in the ground-dwelling arthropod community. Burning significantly reduced the numbers of predators regardless of fire frequency and resulted in an increased number of detritivores. A total of 42 genera were reduced by prescribed burning; 32 genera were captured in greater numbers on annually burned plots, and I I genera had higher numbers in one or both of the intermediate burn frequencies (biennial or quadrennial). Twenty-six genera were captured in equal numbers on quadrennially and annually burned plots, but in significantly lower numbers than on unburned plots, demonstrating that 4 years was insufficient time for their populations to recover from mild dormant-season fires. Arthropod response to burning appeared to be species specific so attempts to generalize how arthropods will respond based on a few species or groups should be avoided. The slow recovery rate of so many species suggests that management oriented toward conservation of biodiversity in longleaf pine flatwoods should include areas of fire exclusion.

This species has a multivoltine life cycle and the overwintering stages show a geographical variation across Japan ( Kurota & Shimada, 2002). In cooler areas, overwintering occurs during the final instar, whereas in warmer climates overwintering can occur during several developmental stages: non-diapausing young instars, diapausing instars, and adults. In this study, we investigated the adult reproductive diapause in three populations from different geographical regions to clarify the role of geographical variation on overwintering strategies. We found that: ( 1) B. dorsalis entered reproductive diapause in addition to larval diapause under short photoperiods, ( 2) diapause propensity was higher and the critical photoperiod was longer in populations from cooler regions, and ( 3) the sensitive photoperiod range was the first 5 days after emergence. Predictions of the overwintering stage, derived from critical photoperiods, were consistent with actual overwintering stages observed in each population. The geographical variation in diapause induction is likely to reflect the adaptive overwintering strategy in each local environment.

Our objective was to compare woody plant cover, density, and diversity on burned and nontreated rangelands. Five rangeland sites that received 2 dormant-season burns, 5 rangeland sites that received a combination of 1 dormant-season and 1 growing-season burn, and 5 sites of nontreated rangeland were selected on the Chaparral Wildlife Management Area, Dimmit and La Salle Counties, Tex. Woody plant cover was estimated using the line intercept method, and stem density was estimated in 25-x 1.5-m plots. Species richness did not differ among treatments. Percent woody plant cover was reduced by 50 and 41% on winter and winter-summer combination burned sites, respectively. Honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa Torr.), twisted acacia (Acacia schaffneri S. Wats.), Texas persimmon (Diospyros texana Scheele), lotebush [Ziziphus obtusifolia (Hook.) T.&G.], wolfberry (Lycium berlandieri Dunal), and tasajillo (Opuntia leptocaulis Cand.) canopy cover was greatest on nontreated sites. Woody plant density declined by 29 and 23% on winter and winter-summer combination burned sites, respectively. Density of guayacan (Guajacum angustifolium Engelm.), wolfberry, and tasajillo was less on all burning treatments. Percent cover of spiny hackberry (Celtis pallida Torr.) and density of Texas pricklypear (Opuntia engelmannii Salm-Reif.-Dyck) declined on winter burned sites. Inclusion of summer fire into the burning regime did not increase declines in woody plants. Fire created a post-fire environment which resulted in the decline of many woody plant species. It is unclear to what degree other environmental factors such as herbivory and competition between woody plants and among woody and herbaceous vegetation may have interacted with fire in producing woody plant declines. Fire may be a useful tool in managing woody vegetation on native south Texas rangelands, while maintaining woody plant diversity.																	0022-409X					MAR	2003	56	2					159	166		10.2307/4003900								WOS:000181520400008

Seeds were scarified 5 or 10 minutes in concentrated sulfuric acid, tumbled 5 or 10 days in course grit, or unscarified (control). Seeds underwent subsequent stratification for 0 (control), 30, or 60 days. Averaged across scarification treatments, the 2 southernmost sources lacked a stratification requirement, while northern seed sources achieved their highest germination following the longest stratification duration (60 days). Improvement in germination due to stratification was greatest for the 2 highest elevation Questa sources. Scarification treatments were less effective in improving germination than stratification treatments, and produced more variable results. A 5-minute soak in sulfuric acid was the most effective scarification treatment, but for 2 sources, this treatment reduced germination. Variability in the stratification requirement appears to be an adaptation to macroclimatic differences among seed sources, whereas differential response to scarification may be a response to microclimatic differences.																	0022-409X					MAR	2003	56	2					198	202		10.2307/4003905								WOS:000181520400013						
J	Geiser, F; Drury, RL				Geiser, F; Drury, RL			Radiant heat affects thermoregulation and energy expenditure during rewarming from torpor	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY												The high expenditure of energy required for endogenous rewarming is one of the widely perceived disadvantages of torpor. However, recent evidence demonstrates that passive rewarming either by the increase of ambient temperature or by basking in the sun appears to be common in heterothermic birds and mammals. As it is presently unknown how radiant heat affects energy expenditure during rewarming from torpor and little is known about how it affects normothermic thermoregulation, we quantified the effects of radiant heat on body temperature and metabolic rate of the small (body mass 25 g) marsupial Sminthopsis macroura in the laboratory. Normothermic resting individuals exposed to radiant heat were able to maintain metabolic rates near basal levels (at 0.91 ml O-2 g(-1) h(-1)) and a constant body temperature down to an ambient temperature of 12 degreesC. In contrast, metabolic rates of individuals without access to radiant heat were 4.5-times higher at an ambient temperature of 12 degreesC and body temperature fell with ambient temperature. During radiant heat-assisted passive rewarming from torpor, animals did not employ shivering but appeared to maximise uptake of radiant heat. Their metabolic rate increased only 3.2-times with a 15-degreesC rise of body temperature (Q(10) = 2.2), as predicted by Q10 effects. In contrast, during active rewarming shivering was intensive and metabolic rates showed an 11.6-times increase. Although body temperature showed a similar absolute change between the beginning and the end of the rewarming process, the overall energetic cost during active rewarming was 6.3-times greater than that during passive, radiant heat-assisted rewarming. Our study demonstrates that energetic models assuming active rewarming from torpor at low ambient temperatures can substantially over-estimate energetic costs. The low energy expenditure during passive arousal provides an alternative explanation as to why daily torpor is common in sunny regions and suggests that the prevalence of torpor in low latitudes may have been under-estimated in the past.																	0174-1578					FEB	2003	173	1					55	60		10.1007/s00360-002-0311-y								WOS:000181647900007	12592443					
J	Coleman, M; Abbott, RJ				Coleman, M; Abbott, RJ			Possible causes of morphological variation in an endemic Moroccan groundsel (Senecio leucanthemifolius var. casablancae): evidence from chloroplast DNA and random amplified polymorphic DNA markers	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Genetic variation was assessed in Senecio leucanthemifolius var. casablancae (Compositae), a Moroccan Atlantic coast endemic, in order to examine possible causes of atypical leaf morphology in three populations south of the known range. Evidence for introgression from S. glaucus ssp. coronopifolius and/or divergence was investigated with molecular markers. Both random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and chloroplast (cp) DNA restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) differentiated the species well. Some evidence that hybridization may have occurred between the two species was provided by cpDNA markers. However, biparentally inherited RAPD markers failed to provide any support for the hypothesis that intermediate leaf morphologies in atypical populations arose through hybridization. Consequently, they are most likely to have arisen via divergence caused by drift and/or selection. Genetic distances among populations of S. leucanthemifolius were significant in all but one case. Isolation by distance was indicated by a significant positive correlation between genetic and geographical distances (r=0.68, P=0.01, Mantel test). These results suggest that long-distance achene dispersal is rare, despite the presence of a well-developed pappus. The observed loss of pappus at achene maturity may explain this unexpected result. Due to the morphological distinction of var. casablancae from other varieties of S. leucanthemifolius , we suggest elevation to species rank and treatment of the atypical material at infraspecific rank.																	0962-1083					FEB	2003	12	2					423	434		10.1046/j.1365-294X.2003.01729.x								WOS:000180421000011	12535093

The model is forced by annual cycles of mixed-layer depth, day length, photosynthetically available radiation and a temperature-dependent phytoplankton maximum growth rate. Although ocean-colour data are potentially limited in their ability to constrain model parameters because they provide information about the phytoplankton component only, this limitation is offset by the volume of data available covering the range of possible biogeochemical responses to similar and widely varying physical conditions. The results are improved by applying wintertime nutrient estimates based on in situ observations as an additional constraint. Repeatability of parameter estimates obtained from independent samples is examined. Results obtained using regional and basin-wide sampling strategies for obtaining the optimization dataset are compared and the geographic applicability of the calibrated models is assessed.

C. maculatus was slightly more tolerant to phosphine than C. chinensis. Increases in gas concentration were more effective than increases in exposure time in achieving complete mortality. The concentrations for 50% and 99% mortality in C. maculatus were higher than the corresponding values for C chinensis, except at 0.25 mg/L and I mg/L concentrations and at the 48 h exposure period for 99% mortality.

J	Pigliucci, M; Pollard, H; Cruzan, MB				Pigliucci, M; Pollard, H; Cruzan, MB			Comparative studies of evolutionary responses to light environments in Arabidopsis	AMERICAN NATURALIST												In this article, we compare the reaction norms to foliage shade (changes in light quality, spatially fine-grained environmental variation) and photoperiod (day length, spatially coarse-grained environmental variation) in several haplotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana from Scandinavia. We found that both across-environment means and phenotypic plasticities evolved continuously and very rapidly within this group. Both character means and trait plasticities were highly integrated, in part as predicted by the adaptive plasticity hypothesis for response to foliage shade (the so-called shade-avoidance syndrome). We found that a significant but small fraction of the variance in across-treatment trait means and plasticities in response to one environmental factor is explained by variation of the same traits in response to the other factor. Genetic relatedness based on chloroplast DNA sequence variation among haplotypes was not associated with variation in across-treatment character means or their plasticities, suggesting that evolution of these characters has occurred on a local geographic scale via reticulation (outcrossing) among maternal lines rather than by the differential survival of selfing lineages.																	0003-0147					JAN	2003	161	1					68	82		10.1086/345460								WOS:000180186600006	12650463					
J	Brandel, M; Schutz, W				Brandel, M; Schutz, W			Seasonal dormancy patterns and stratification requirements in seeds of Verbena officinalis L.	BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY					14th Annual Meeting of the Gesellschafr-fur-Okologie	MAY, 2001	UNIV AGR SCI, INST BOT, VIENNA, AUSTRIA	Gesell Okol	UNIV AGR SCI, INST BOT			Dormancy patterns and germination responses to incremental stratification were investigated in Verbena officinalis L. (Verbenaceae), a widely-distributed ruderal, but considered as an originally mediterranean plant. In an initial experiment, samples of seeds buried in the field were exhumed at monthly intervals over a period of 38 months and tested for germination in light and darkness at 25/15 degreesC and 1515 degreesC. Seeds were strongly dormant when fresh and mature and came out of dormancy during winter. Seeds entered conditional dormancy in spring, while main dormancy relief occurred in winter. There was no seed mortality, and no germination occurred in the soil during burial. The results imply, that V officinalis germinates preferably in late spring and has the potential to accumulate a persistent seed bank. The effects of stratification temperature and duration on dormancy were investigated in a second experiment. Dry-stored seeds were stratified wet at a range of temperatures from 3-18 degreesC in darkness for periods of up to 28 weeks, and tested over a range of constant temperatures (3-25 degreesC) and at 1515 degreesC in light, and at 25 degreesC and 1515 degreesC in the dark. Seeds came out of primary dormancy when kept at temperatures between 3-12 degreesC, while higher temperatures were ineffective in breaking dormancy. There was no induction of secondary dormancy during the stratification period of 28 weeks. We conclude that a gradual increase of the ambient temperatures and/or an increase in amplitude size is required for dormancy induction. Weakly dormant seeds required either high constant mean (> 15 degreesC), or fluctuating temperatures for germination. Only a small fraction of the seeds acquired the ability to germinate in darkness with incremental stratification. There is no indication of germination and dormancy traits that can be interpreted as relict adaptations to mediterranean conditions.																	1439-1791						2003	4	4					329	337		10.1078/1439-1791-00164								WOS:000184879400006						
J	Erlykova, N				Erlykova, N			Inter- and intraclonal variability in the photoperiodic response and fecundity in the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum (Hemiptera : Aphididae)	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY												Interclonal variability in the photoperiodic responses of the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum and intraclonal differences between wingless viviparous females (=apterae) and winged viviparous females (=alatae) were studied. in 7 clones collected from peas near St.Petersburg the effect of constant diel photoperiods (from 0L : 24D to 24L : OD at 20degreesC) on sexual morph determination and dynamics of morph production were recorded. Apterae of 5 clones and apterae and alatae of 2 clones were studied. The mean and age-dependent fecundity of apterae and alatae were compared. The clones studied in detail can be divided in two groups. The first includes clones that produced winged males and had critical photoperiods for female morph determination around 12L : 12D. The second includes clones with critical photoperiods for female morph determination around 17L : 71); these clones produced wingless males, and one clone produced only oviparae. The intraclonal differences in the photoperiodic limits for ovipara and male production depended on the clone-specific abundance of males. The shapes of the photoperiodic curves for male production also depended on the clone-specific abundance of males. In short-day conditions alatae produced more oviparae and fewer males, and the range of photoperiods that induced ovipara production in alatae was nearly twice as wide as that in apterae. The photoperiodic limits for ovipara and male production differed for apterae and alatae. The fecundity of alatae was lower, although they reproduced for longer and lived longer than apterae. Both apterae and alatae reproduced more intensively over the first 2 weeks. Apterae and alatae began to produce males at the same age. Because of their late onset of larviposition, the reproductive pause that divides female and male production was obscured in alatae. Both apterae and alatae tended to produce initially and finally batches of viviparous offspring, possibly reflecting age-dependent endogenous changes in the hormonal titres in the parents.																	1210-5759						2003	100	1					31	37		10.14411/eje.2003.006								WOS:000182570700005

Mortality at emergence was quantified in C. mercuriale. Consistent with their larval diapause characteristics, both species had an asynchronous emergence pattern, typical of "summer" species. Daily emergence of C. mercuriale was positively correlated with the duration of sunlight on the previous day (controlling for season) and its emergence period was found to be shorter than that observed in its core populations in Central and Mediterranean Europe. No differences were found between the patterns of emergence of the sexes in either species. Sex ratio at emergence differed significantly from 1: 1 (at 1.35 : 1 - mates : females) in C. mercuriale but not in Ceriagrion tenellum (at 1.04 : 1). Body size at emergence declined more steeply with time in females than in males of C. mercuriale because large size may confer a greater reproductive advantage in females (larger females may be more fecund) than males in non-territorial odonates. Percentage mortality of C mercuriale at emergence was low (4.9% including deformed individuals), the main cause of mortality being deformity.

J	Danks, HV				Danks, HV			Studying insect photoperiodism and rhythmicity: Components, approaches and lessons	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY					2nd Czech/Japanese Seminar on Entomology	AUG 05-08, 2002	CESKE BUDEJOVICE, CZECH REPUBLIC	Acad Sci Czech Republic, Inst Entomol, Univ S Bohemia, Fac Biol Sci				Components of daily and seasonal timing systems in insects are reviewed. Photoperiod indicates seasonal position reliably, but signals can be much modified by habitat, latitude and season. Several receptor features and pigment systems are known, with different daily, seasonal and general functions, including differences between circadian and seasonal reception. Clocks can serve several different purposes, functioning as daily oscillators, interval timers or through successive requirements. The molecular functioning of circadian clocks is best known, but even so there is considerable complexity and diversity and much remains to be discovered. We know relatively little about the internal states that provide information for timed responses (such as the photoperiodic "counter"), about the central controlling mechanism, or about the effectors that transmit output signals. Nevertheless, temporal responses serve a very great range of purposes in insects, and the reported complexity in all of the components of timing systems reflects complex ecological needs across daily and seasonal intervals. The variety of components and the complexity of interactions reported (even within species), as well as the diversity of such elements as photosensitive pigments, molecular clock function and potential neurotransmitters, suggests that - unlike some earlier expectations - there is no single master clock for all timing functions in insects. Insect photoperiodism and rhythmicity have been studied by both observational or direct approaches (examination of system elements or devices, and qualities such as survival), and by inferential or indirect approaches (such as interpretation of various responses to photoperiod, modelling, and estimating fitness). Many students work with only one approach, but the power of different approaches is not equal, and knowledge at one level may not give answers at another. These difficulties tend to limit our understanding of the linkages among components. This overview suggests several lessons for the study of photoperiodism and rhythmicity. There are multiple elements, complex integration and a diversity of clocks, showing that different processes serve different purposes. The diversity of findings also results from the fact that different investigative approaches, which depend on the question being asked and on the perspective of the investigator, can influence the outcome of the investigation. Given these complexities, I believe that the key to interpreting photoperiodic and circadian responses is their ecological value. Notwithstanding the interest of timing mechanisms or their parts and of specific responses, daily rhythms and seasonal timing are best understood through the essential context provided by the ecological demands on the actual organisms under study.																	1210-5759						2003	100	2					209	221		10.14411/eje.2003.036								WOS:000183997500001

Reproduction of all species started in autumn and continued during the winter months. Highest reproductive and survival rates occurred at low temperatures and within a small thermal window ranging from 5degrees to 10degreesC: The fitness of individuals decreased at higher and lower temperatures. The lower thermal threshold for all developmental stages was in the range from -5degreesC to +2degreesC. The metabolisms of the species were independent of temperature in both dormant and non-dormant stages and were elevated in the low temperature range in comparison to other species which show a temperature-dependent reaction pattern. Optimal dates for reproduction were determined by the duration of an obligatory adult summer diapause. In C. nigricans, which favours the litter layer of deciduous forests, this duration was fine-tuned by exogenic factors, such as photoperiod and temperature. In contrast, the soil-inhabiting species Ch. elongata showed a homeostatic response pattern, independent of temperature and photoperiod. Heritability (h 2) of the duration of diapause was approximately 0.26 in C. nigricans, less pronounced in Ch. agilis (ca. 0.12) and not evident in the subterranean species Ch. elongata. All three species compensated for the vagaries of climate through bet-hedging tactics. Bet-hedging is so pervasive that a recent substantial increase in temperature seems to have a negligible effect on the distribution pattern of all three species. Based on life-history data it is conceivable that both soil-inhabiting Choleva species, which require a relatively low thermal sum for their development, were already present in western Europe during the sub-arctic conditions when ice shields reached their maximum extension during glacial periods by shifting their activity from the cold to the warm season. The Atlantic fringe north of the Pyrenees, where the climate was not cold enough for permafrost during glacial stages, was probably the only refuge where Ch. elongata might have survived. In contrast, the Mediterranean region should have been the northernmost refuge for C. nigricans during glacial periods. This species has relatively high day-degree requirements (= 1150 ddegrees) for individual development when compared to both Choleva species (= 700 ddegrees).																	1210-5759						2003	100	2					233	243		10.14411/eje.2003.038								WOS:000183997500003

EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY												Habitats of pre-hibernating gregarious larvae of the endangered Marsh Fritillary butterfly (Euphydryas aurinia) were studied in field in Western Bohemia, Czech Republic. The species inhabits moist seminatural meadows managed by light grazing and haymaking; the only local host plant is Succisa pratensis. The redundancy analyses of the vegetation composition (around 166 nest-bearing and 381 unoccupied host plants) showed that nest presence was positively associated with short cushion-forming grasses (esp. Nardus stricta). It was negatively associated with competitively superior tall grasses (e.g., Deschampsia caespitosa) and tall herbs. Comparison of Ellenberg's indicator values of vegetation in occupied vs. unoccupied plots revealed that the nests were more often found in drier, nitrogen-poorer and more acidic conditions than unoccupied plants. Multiple regressions of nest presence against architecture of the host plants (170 occupied, 1280 unoccupied) revealed that the nests were associated with densely clumped host plants, low to medium height of sward and mechanical disturbance. The patterns agree with our knowledge of the biology of the larvae: short sward (related to low nitrogen, humidity, and low pH) facilitates larval basking; high host density reduces the likelihood of starvation. Sod disturbance facilitates host plant germination. The conditions favourable for the nests were also favourable for the host plant, but the plants grew in broader range of conditions than that occupied by the nests. The abandoning of a site results into a situation when the conditions first become intolerable for the butterfly, and ultimately for the plant. Since grazing and mowing have a different impact on vegetation composition and architecture, we propose that the studied populations have persisted in a semi-dynamic state in the two modes of management. Conservation management should mimic the dynamics of traditional land use on the smaller scales of extant colonies.

Seasonal cycles are principally entrained by photoperiod and temperature but a range of other variables including lunar phase and social interaction may also operate. Photoperiod information is transduced through the light inhibition of pineal melatonin synthesis but the mechanism by which this regulates the reproductive endocrine system is not clear. There is less information on the specific effects of temperature but these are likely to involve effects on expression and activity of regulatory proteins. Environmental regulation of high latitude species appears to operate across a hierarchy of variables with photoperiod then temperature as primary drivers, whereas in tropical habitats, the hierarchy may be inverted.																	0920-1742						2003	28	1-4					385	389		10.1023/B:FISH.0000030602.51939.50								WOS:000221880400139						
J	Sakakibara, M				Sakakibara, M			Development of a meridic diet for adults of the West Indian sweetpotato weevil, Euscepes postfasciatus (Fairmaire) (Coleoptera : Curculionidae).	JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY												A series of experiments were conducted to develop a meridic diet for adults of the West Indian sweetpotato weevil, Euscepes postfasciatus, by modifing the diet for larvae of E. postfasciatus developed by Shimoji and Kohama (1996b). Adult weevils were reared at 26degreesC, 70% RH, under 14L10D photoperiodic conditions. Within the range of KOH doses tested (0-0.107 mol/l), as the KOH dose was increased in the diet, hatchability of the eggs laid increased and longevity of females decreased. The pH of water in the diet did not affect longevity, fecundity and hatchability, even though the diet containing acid water (pH 2.7) resulted in a higher number of hatched offspring than the other diets containing distilled water (pH 6.0), mineral water (pH 9.0) and alkaline water (pH 11.1). Constituents of the tentatively developed diet were 50 g sweetpotato powder, 20 g agar, 20 g sucrose, 12 g casein, 10 g powdered cellulose, 5 g yeast extract, 2.5 g Vanderzant vitamine mixture, 1.5 g Wesson's salts, 2.99 g KOH, 1 g sorbic acid, I g methyl paraben, 0.4 g cholesterol, 0.2 g chloramphenicol, and 500 ml acid water.																	0021-4914						2003	47	2					67	72		10.1303/jjaez.2003.67								WOS:000183990300003

Fecundity patterns showed spawning peaks in summer and fall in both habitats, with reduced spawning in late fall and early winter. Subtidal females averaged 1015.2 eggs mm(-1) body length (range 0 to 2000 eggs mm(-1)), while intertidal females averaged 607.4 eggs mm(-1) (range 0 to 1520 eggs mm(-1)). Mean egg diameters were not significantly different between worms from the 2 habitats, ranging between 90.4 mum (SD = 3.7) and 89.5 mum (SD = 4.3) for intertidal and subtidal worms respectively. Inter- and intra-census comparisons of egg diameter, fecundity and adult length revealed few statistically significant relationships, suggesting that intertidal and subtidal worms were the same age. Adult lengths in both habitats did change seasonally. The smallest adult worms were found shortly after massive fall recruitment replaced a large percentage of individuals in both intertidal and subtidal populations. Stepwise multiple regression indicated that 76.2 % of the variance in intertidal fecundity was explained by a negative correlation with wave height (40.4 %), and a positive correlation with day length (34.7 %). In contrast, 85.5 % of the variance in subtidal fecundity was explained by a positive correlation with day length (77.4 %), and a negative correlation with chlorophyll a concentration (8.1 %). While habitat-specific differences in energy available for gametogenesis probably contribute towards the observed fecundity trends, the force of crashing waves could also influence fecundity, as it may affect frequency of spawning in intertidal but not subtidal habitats.																	0171-8630						2003	256						123	133		10.3354/meps256123								WOS:000184808900011						
J	Lewis, C; Olive, PJW; Bentley, MG				Lewis, C; Olive, PJW; Bentley, MG			Pre-emptive competition as a selective pressure for early reproduction in the polychaete Nereis virens	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Reproduction in the semelparous polychaete Nereis virens occurs at a time of year when seawater temperatures are lower than the optimum temperatures for fertilization and larval development and at a time when seawater temperatures are rising. This study assesses the possible role of intra-specific competitive interactions between settling N. virens post-larvae as a selective pressure for 'early' reproduction, A series of laboratory competition experiments were conducted between 2 cohorts of N. virens post-larvae, under a range of environmental conditions. Significant pre-emptive competition between settling post-larvae was recorded at 15degreesC, whereby a survival advantage was gained via prior residence with early larval settlers, out-competing later arrivals. This competitive interaction was reduced at lower temperatures and no significant effect was measured at 5degreesC. An increase in age difference between the 2 cohorts of post-larvae increased the competitive effect, whilst photoperiod regime and food availability had no significant effect on the outcome of these experiments. Intra-specific competition was greatest at the temperatures at which maximum fertilization and development are known to occur, but was reduced at the temperature range at which spawning occurs in the field. It is suggested, therefore, that pre-emptive competition between settling post-larvae forms a strong selective pressure for breeding early at a time of year when temperatures are below the optimum for fertilization and development.

However, spatial strategies remain poorly understood over seasonal scales in most species, including, most notably, the plankton-feeding basking shark Cetorhinus maximus. It was proposed nearly 50 yr ago that this globally distributed species migrates from coastal summerfeeding areas of the northeast Atlantic to hibernate during winter in deep water on the bottom of continental-shelf slopes. This view has perpetuated in the literature even though the 'hibernation theory' has not been tested directly. We have now tracked basking sharks for the first time over seasonal scales (1.7 to 6.5 mo) using 'pop-up' satellite archival transmitters. We show that they do not hibernate during winter but instead undertake extensive horizontal (up to 3400 km) and vertical (>750 m depth) movements to utilise productive continental-shelf and shelf-edge habitats during summer, autumn and winter. They travel long distances (390 to 460 km) to locate temporally discrete productivity 'hotspots' at shelf-break fronts, but at no time were prolonged movements into open-ocean regions away from shelf waters observed. Basking sharks have a very broad vertical diving range and can dive beyond the known range of planktivorous whales. Our study suggests this species can exploit shelf and slope-associated zooplankton communities in mesopelagic (200 to 1000 m) as well as epipelagic habitat (0 to 200 m).

J	Hermes-Lima, M; Zenteno-Savin, T				Hermes-Lima, M; Zenteno-Savin, T			Animal response to drastic changes in oxygen availability and physiological oxidative stress	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY C-TOXICOLOGY & PHARMACOLOGY					Workshop on Comparative Aspects of Oxidative Stress in Biological Systems	OCT, 2001	LA PAZ, MEXICO					Oxygen is essential for most life forms, but it is also inherently toxic due to its biotransformation into reactive oxygen species (ROS). In fact, the development of many animal and plant pathological conditions, as well as natural aging, is associated with excessive ROS production and/or decreased antioxidant capacity. However, a number of animal species are able to tolerate, under natural conditions, situations posing a large potential for oxidative stress. Situations range from anoxia in fish, frogs and turtles, to severe hypoxia in organs of freeze-tolerant snakes, frogs and insect larvae, or diving seals and turtles, and mild hypoxia in organs of dehydrated frogs and toads or estivating snails. All situations are reminiscent of ischemia/reperfusion events that are highly damaging to most mammals and birds. This article reviews the responses of anoxia/hypoxia-tolerant animals when subjected to environmental and metabolic stresses leading to oxygen limitation. Abrupt changes in metabolic rate in ground squirrels arousing from hibernation, as well as snails arousing from estivation, may also set up a condition of increased ROS formation. Comparing the responses from these diverse animals, certain patterns emerge. The most commonly observed response is an enhancement of the antioxidant defense. The increase in the baseline activity of key antioxidant enzymes, as well as 'secondary' enzymatic defenses, and/or glutathione levels in preparation for a putative oxidative stressful situation arising from tissue reoxygenation seem to be the preferred evolutionary adaptation. Increasing the overall antioxidant capacity during anoxia/hypoxia is of relevance for species such as garter snakes (Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis) and wood fogs (Rana sylvatica), while diving freshwater turtles (Trachemys scripta elegans) appear to rely mainly upon high constitutive activities of antioxidant enzymes to deal with oxidative stress arising during tissue reoxygetiation. The possibility that some animal species might control post-anoxic ROS generation cannot be excluded. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

The CfChitinase cDNA was determined to be 2856 nucleotides long with the longest open reading frame made up of 1671 nucleotides that encoded a protein that was 557 amino acid long with a predicted molecular mass of 62 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence showed 76-79% identity with other lepidopteran chitinases. Northern blots revealed that transcripts of CfChitinase appeared prior to each molt and peaked on the day of ecdysis from the second instar to the pupal stage but disappeared immediately after the molt. No transcripts could be detected in the early first instar prior to the spinning of the hibernaculum or in the diapausing second instars or during the intermolt periods of the other instars. Western blot analysis revealed that the protein appeared 12 h prior to ecdysis and disappeared 12 h after ecdysis from the sixth instar to pupal stage. The 20-hydroxyecdysone analog, tebufenozide (RH5992), induced expression of CfChitinase in the early stage of the sixth instar and caused a precocious and incomplete molt into an extra larval stage. During the sixth instar to the pupal molt, transcripts could be detected only in the epidermis and fat bodies, but not in the midgut. Western blots showed that the protein was present in the epidermis and midgut, but not in the fat bodies. The recombinant protein expressed in Autographa californica multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) showed high levels of chitinolytic activity with an optimal pH range 6-9. Glycosylation appeared to be necessary for the chitinolytic activity and secretion of the recombinant protein. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Gilg, O				Gilg, O			The summer decline of the collared lemming, Dicrostonyx groenlandicus, in high arctic Greenland	OIKOS												I studied the population structure and dynamics of the collared lemming, Dicrostonyx groenlandicus Traill, on Traill Island (NE Greenland) in 1998 to 2000. This is the first comprehensive study of a Greenlandic collared lemming population. During this period, population density continuously declined (> 100 fold-decrease) from more than 10 ind/ha (peak year 1998) to less than 0.1 ind/ha (low year 2000), with the exception of one period of increase in the winter 1998-99. Several population parameters were correlated with these changes in density. Average body mass was greater in the peak year than in the intermediate year (1999) and greater in August than in July in both years. Growth rates were only positive in 1998 and only for young lemmings. Females had unexpectedly larger home ranges than males and were more mobile than males during the decline phase (1999). Poor recruitment and high predation rates (up to 3.4% per day for females in 1998) were the proximate causes of the summer declines in the study area. A simple calculation shows that even with a maximal rate of increase, this lemming population would not have been able to compensate for the high predation rate, and hence it necessarily faced a predation-induced summer decline during the part of population oscillation studied.

J	Spieth, HR				Spieth, HR			Estivation and hibernation of Pieris brassicae (L.) in southern Spain: synchronization of two complex behavioral patterns	POPULATION ECOLOGY												The large white butterfly, Pieris brassicae, has an unusually complex life-history in its southernmost range in Western Europe. This complexity results (1) from two developmental rests, a short-day induced hibernation and a long-day induced estivation response, and (2) from the exceptionally early appearance of the first adult generation in January/February and a subsequent winter diapause in some of their progeny. It Was found that in spring and autumn, different generations are faced with critical photophases which induce hibernation or estivation, with the consequence that in five out of six generations per year, only some develop directly whereas the others enter a dormancy phase. To assess the implications of this high number of optional responses on the generation succession, the development time was studied at various photoperiods and temperatures. The results showed that a threshold response determines the duration of estivation. With unchanged summer conditions (daylengths greater than or equal to15h) estivation lasts on average 18-19 weeks, while with autumn conditions (daylengths less than or equal to14 h) it lasts only 7 weeks. A change of photophases from greater than or equal to15h to less than or equal to14h terminates estivation within about 3-5 weeks, slightly depending on the pupal exposure time in summer conditions. The duration of estivation is not affected by temperature or by the photophases experienced by the caterpillars. The winter diapause lasts 18-19 weeks on average with winter conditions (12degreesC/10.30h light), but only 8-10 weeks with late spring conditions (21degreesC/15h light). These results were used to assess the effects on the population phenology, with the finding that despite the different developmental pathways, a desynchronization of the generation succession is largely prevented. Estivation, hibernation, and direct development at different seasons are well adjusted to a common phenological pattern of a continuously reproducing population. This pattern of activity covers a cryptic dormant subpopulation, and could not have been deduced by field observations.																	1438-3896					DEC	2002	44	3					273	280		10.1007/s101440200031								WOS:000180797600017						
J	Pestsova, E; Roder, M				Pestsova, E; Roder, M			Microsatellite analysis of wheat chromosome 2D allows the reconstruction of chromosomal inheritance in pedigrees of breeding programmes	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS												The dwarfing gene Rht8 and the photoperiodic insensitivity gene Ppd-D1 are linked on the short arm of chromosome 2D of bread wheat and play an important role in determining the geographic adaptation of modern wheat varieties. The genes are believed to originate from the old Japanese variety 'Akakomugi' and have been distributed throughout the world by diverse breeding programmes. Twelve microsatellite loci previously mapped on wheat chromosome 2D were used for a retrospective analysis of 59 wheat varieties with known pedigree, to trace the transmittance of the chromosomal region around these genes during extended breeding programmes. Within the range of the screened varieties 100 alleles were detected at the 12 microsatellite loci. For each microsatellite locus, a screen over varieties was performed to find the alleles corresponding to the parental variety 'Akakomugi'. A comparison of wheat varieties carrying the 192-bp allele, at locus Xgwm261-2D which is diagnostic for the presence of the gene Rht8, with the varieties without Rht8, showed linkage disequilibrium of 'Akakomugi' alleles for a segment of chromosome 2D which comprised at least 28 cM. Selection was accompanied with a linkage drag of 'Akakomugi' alleles in the neighbouring loci to Rht8. A diminution of the segment of chromosome 2D originating from 'Akakomugi' during several pedigree generations was observed. Varieties of the early generations were found to carry the whole short arm of chromosome 2D of 'Akakomugi', while the varieties of further selections possessed smaller segments including the diagnostic allele at locus Xgwm261-2D. Our results demonstrate that microsatellites can be successfully used for studying the inheritance of chromosomes within pedigrees of breeding programmes.

Life history parameter values incorporated into the model were estimated by laboratory rearing experiments. To validate the present model, the development of eggs laid monthly from June I through November I was simulated under dynamic temperature and photoperiod conditions at Ayabe City. The individuals laid on June I did not enter diapause but emerged in early August of the same year. On the other hand, about 2/3 of the individuals laid on July 1, and all those laid on August I and September I entered diapause (or quiescence), and started to emerge in late May of the following year. Individuals laid on October I and November I overwintered as young larvae (1st-3rd stadia) and eggs, respectively, and the majority of these emerged in late July-early August. Interestingly, the remaining individuals entered diapause in the 2nd year and emerged in June of the 3rd year. Analyses of these simulation results suggested that concentrated emergence of P hilaris can occur twice in one year (in late May-early June and in late July-early August) at Ayabe, and this is fairly concordant with known adult prevalence at this location considering the long life-span of adults. It was also suggested that although P hilaris at Ayabe has basically a univoltine life cycle with a facultative diapause, varying proportions of the population appear to have a bivoltine life cycle or a semivoltine life cycle depending on the meteorological conditions of that year. The life cycle of P hilaris is suggested to be very flexible and adaptive to environmental fluctuations.																	0003-6862					NOV	2002	37	4					559	569										WOS:000180727400008						
J	Saito, Y; Sakagami, T; Sahara, K				Saito, Y; Sakagami, T; Sahara, K			Differences in diapause attributes between two clinal forms distinguished by male-to-male aggression in a subsocial spider mite, Schizotetranychus miscanthi Saito	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH												The nest-weaving spider mite Schizotetranychus miscanthi Saito showed a cline in male-to-male aggression intensity with minimum winter temperature. The altered kin structure in spring nests, which might be caused by winter harshness, was hypothesized to be a key factor responsible for the cline in male-to-male aggression. In Japan, we found two forms (high- and low-aggression forms) that showed different clinal trends with similar regression slopes and different intercepts. The former is characteristic of local populations from milder climates, whereas the latter occurs in harsher climates. We hypothesized that the intensity of female diapause, which may determine whether males are produced during late winter, was one of the factors separating these two clinal forms. In the four populations studied, short day length during the developmental period (egg to adult emergence) induced diapause in females. Diapause intensity varied greatly among populations, and particularly between the high-aggression and low-aggression forms. These data, together with data on winter harshness between the localities, led us to believe that female diapause is one of the factors affecting relatedness between interacting males in nests and can explain why the two forms of S. miscanthi have different clinal trends in male aggression in Japan.

J	Gerten, D; Adrian, R				Gerten, D; Adrian, R			Species-specific changes in the phenology and peak abundance of freshwater copepods in response to warm summers	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Climate warming is now widely recognised as a major factor influencing ecological processes in terrestrial, marine and freshwater habitats. Here, we investigated how a recent period of warm springs and summers has affected the population dynamics of various cyclopoid copepods in a central European lake. We compared (i) the duration of the period when the species were present in the water column, and (ii) their annual peak density in a period dominated by cool summers (1980-91) and one dominated by warm summers (1992-99). 2. The copepods under investigation were (i) Thermocyclops oithonoides, (ii) Mesocyclops leuckarti and (iii) Acanthocyclops robustus. These species differ in their thermal demand and seasonal phenology. Therefore, we hypothesised that enhanced summer warming would produce species-specific responses. 3. The active phase of the copepods was usually prolonged both in spring and autumn. The earlier emergence of T. oithonoides (May in the warm years, July in the cool years) was probably related to high water temperature in late spring. The later onset of winter diapause in all species may have been coupled to raised temperature in late summer and autumn. 4. The annual peak abundance of the two thermophiles M. leuckarti and T. oithonoides increased significantly in the warm period. In the latter case, the increase was probably because of the early start to population growth. In contrast, M. leuckarti probably responded primarily to mid-summer heat waves, in that its development time was likely to be short. We speculate that the increase in population size of both species resulted from the development of an additional generation (three instead of two cohorts per year). In contrast to these thermophiles, the coexisting A. robustus, which is adapted to a broader temperature range, did not respond noticeably to the warming trend. 5. In general, the nature of these responses to summer warming varied substantially among species, and depended on the detailed seasonal patterning of the warming. Our findings thus support the hypotheses that single species are sensitive indicators of climate change, and that the seasonal timing of warming is crucial in the context of climate-ecosystem relationships. 6. Moreover, our results add to the body of evidence that climate warming produces shifts in the seasonal phenology of aquatic and terrestrial organisms.

One plot was on a creeping bentgrass green (mowing height 4 mm) and the second plot was a creeping bentgrass range (mowing height 25 mm). Fall applications of compost applied at either 48.7 or 97.4 kg/100 m(2) reduced snow mold severity to levels not significantly different (P < 0.05) from fungicide controls. In addition, a significant increase in green-up of turf (recovery from disease and/or winter dormancy) compared to fertilizer and fungicide controls (P < 0.05) was observed. The two composts showed no significant differences in their capacities to suppress disease. However, most plots that received a higher application rate of compost had significantly less disease for most ratings (P < 0.05) than those that received the lower application rate. At both turf management locations, there were significant increases in green-up in compost-treated plots (&SIM; 85%) compared to the fungicide plots (&SIM; 30%) and fertilizer treatments on a field range (P < 0.05). These differences in green-up among treatments diminished over a four-week-rating period, after which the controls approached or were not significantly different from the compost-treated plots (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences between composts at either experimental location on any rating date (P < 0.05). (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

Differential survival of this stress may in part explain ecological range of a species and could lead to cultural control methods for economically important species. We tested immersion survival for larvae of three species of Diabrotica (viz., D. balteata LeConte, D. undecimpunctata undecimpunctata Mannerheim, and D. virgifera virgifera LeConte). Groups of larvae were submersed in conditioned, hypoxic (dissolved oxygen < 0.3 ppm) tap water, held at 10, 15, 20, or 25 &DEG;C, and periodically removed and assayed for survivorship. We found that time to 50% mortality (LT50) differed significantly between species. Third instar D. u. undecimpunctata were most sensitive to immersion at 25 &DEG;C (LT50 = 9 h), D. balteata were intermediate (LT50 = 15 h) and D. v. virgifera larvae were least sensitive (LT50 = 23 h). Second instar D. v. virgifera were significantly more tolerant of immersion than the other species (LT50 = 56 h versus 15 h for D. u. undecimpunctata and 11 h for D. balteata). Mortality during immersion corresponds with the build up of lactic acid. Survivorship for all species increased with decreasing temperature. The use of flooding in rootworm management is briefly discussed.																	0013-8703					OCT	2002	105	1					29	34		10.1046/j.1570-7458.2002.01029.x								WOS:000180046200003

JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL ZOOLOGY												The influence of environmental factors on the timing of parturition has not been investigated in viviparous squamates. We investigated the interaction between temperature and parturition in two viviparous skink species, the southern snow skink (Niveoscincus microlepidotus) and the metallic skink (N. metallicus). In these species, the timing of parturition is separated from the completion of embryonic development; the delay is attributed to their cool and variable habitats. We examined whether the neurohypophyseal hormone arginine vasotocin (AVT) stimulated parturition in southern snow skinks with late stage embryos in autumn (approximate to6-7 months prior to parturition) and in metallic skinks with late stage embryos in summer (approximate to2-3 weeks prior to parturition). The experiments were conducted at a range of environmentally relevant temperatures (6degreesC, 15degreesC, 22degreesC, and 28degreesC). AVT induced parturition in both species at all temperatures; time until birth, however, occurred more quickly at warmer temperatures (22degreesC and 28degreesC), whereas cooler temperatures delayed parturition. We hypothesize that if cool temperatures are preventing parturition, then temperature must act at some level within the brain to prevent or slow the secretion of AVT. Future experiments will need to determine how temperature influences AVT production. Further research is also required to determine how the timing of parturition is influenced by interactions between temperature, photoperiod, and seasonal hormone patterns.

J	Chaui-Berlinck, JG; Bicudo, JEPW; Monteiro, LHA; Navas, CA				Chaui-Berlinck, JG; Bicudo, JEPW; Monteiro, LHA; Navas, CA			Oscillatory pattern in oxygen consumption of hummingbirds	JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY												Mammals and birds offer the most conspicuous example of homeothermic endothermy, a metabolic feature that implies maintenance of a constant body temperature along broad ranges of ambient temperature. The concept of homeothermic endothermy has been developed in close association with the terms thermoneutral zone and basal metabolic rate. These two metabolic parameters, however, are not easily estimated in micro-endotherms, a difficulty that might emerge from intrinsic aspects of endothermy in minute animals. To address this issue, we used empirical work derived from theoretical considerations. Our theoretical analysis is based on a model of body temperature control by shifts in metabolic rate, and assumes that micro-endotherms lose heat very quickly due to body size, and exhibit a remarkable capacity to rapidly increase metabolic output. We found that these two metabolic traits can lead to non-equilibrium metabolic rate and body temperature. We then measured metabolic rate and body temperature during euthermia in two species of hummingbirds, and analyzed data using the chi(2) periodogram statistic and a power spectral analysis. We found long-range correlation in both oxygen consumption and body temperature during euthermia, a finding that suggests non-random 1/f oscillations. A similar pattern was not found in the rat, a much larger endotherm. Hummingbirds, then, do not appear to maintain steady-state metabolic conditions during euthermia. If, as we suggest, this pattern applies to micro-endotherms in general, the traditional concepts of thermoneutral zone and basal rate of metabolism might not apply to these animals.

Clarifying the utility of event-related brain potentials (ERPs) as diagnostic aids or measures of therapeutic efficacy in SAD requires understanding the range of naturally occurring seasonal patterns of variation in human responses. This investigation studied ERPs from non-patients (402 from men, 415 from women) during the pronounced photoperiod variation of the Alaskan subarctic where light availability ranges from 3.20 It in winter to 21.98 h in summer. ANOVA showed significant (P = 0.03) main effect of photoperiod in the amplitude and latency of P300 responses, as well as a main effect of sensory modality (P = 0.002).

The hyperparasitoid complex of C. melanoscelus is characterized in the three different geographic provinces of Maryland, and the pattern of progeny adult emergence from parasitized C. melanoscelus cocoons as a function of month of attack is compared for the more prominent hyperparasitoid species. Several strategies for apportioning progeny adult emergence to meet the challenges and opportunities of within-season (horizontal) and overwinter (vertical) propagation were found and elucidated. The Simplest strategy was that of Ooencyrtus kuvanae, a species that produced new broods all year long without any obvious need for diapause. A more typical strategy used by several species was to produce a series of new broods until late summer, and then to produce a brood that undergoes diapause with adult emergence in the spring. A more complex strategy was used by Gelis tenellus, which, beginning in late spring, partitioned its progeny so that sonic progeny emerged as an immediate summer generation, while others from the same attack cohort entered diapause and emerged in the spring. The most complex strategy was that used by G. apantelis and G. obscurus. Beginning in late spring, the progeny from these two species were partitioned so that Some progeny would emerge as adults for an immediate summer generation and others from the same attack cohort would emerge in September to bolster the adult population that then produced the diapausing generation. This pattern persisted as the summer progressed, leading to a continuous emergence of multiple generations while simultaneously building up a fall generation upon which the overwintering survival of the species largely depends.																	0013-872X					SEP-OCT	2002	113	4					253	266										WOS:000182073400007						
J	Frutiger, A; Buergisser, GM				Frutiger, A; Buergisser, GM			Life history variability of a grazing stream insect (Liponeura cinerascens minor; Diptera : Blephariceridae)	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Fourteen populations of Liponeura cinerascens minor from different sites in the Swiss Alps were investigated. Our goals were to describe the life history of this blepharicerid species and to analyse how it was influenced by temperature and food availability. 2. Temperature regimes and periphyton density at the sampling sites varied considerably. Mean annual temperature ranged from 3.8 to 6.5 degreesC, with annual amplitudes (i.e. the difference between the mean of the coldest and the warmest month) between 3.7 and 12.0 degreesC. Averaged periphyton density, which was assessed semiquantitatively on a scale from 0 to 5, ranged from 1.1 to 3.3. 3. Larvae or pupae of L. c. minor were found between January and October. Presence of larvae or pupae at individual sites ranged from 100 to 224 days and appeared to be mainly a result of hatching patterns. Individual larval development required between 7 and 20 weeks. Our findings suggest that L. c. minor is univoltine and undergoes an extended (greater than or equal to4 months) egg dormancy during late summer, autumn and winter. 4. Development of L. c. minor was observed from <1 to 15.8 degreesC, indicating it is a cold-stenotherm. Its geographical distribution seems to be constrained by high summer temperatures. Within the tolerated temperature range (0-16 degreesC), however, temperature had no apparent effect on hatching, larval growth rate or pupal size. 5. Larval growth rate and size of pupae were significantly correlated with food availability. Completion of larval development required 300-400 degree-days at sites where periphyton was readily available, but >800 degree-days where periphyton availability was low. 6. No evidence for intraspecific food competition was found, whereas food competition by other blepharicerid species, mainly Hapalothrix lugubris, appeared to be a major reason for the observed food limitation. However, as L. c. minor is much more widespread than H. lugubris , food competition between these two species is likely to occur infrequently. We therefore contend that variations in the life history of L. c. minor are mainly a consequence of its thermal constraints.																	0046-5070					SEP	2002	47	9					1618	1632		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2002.00899.x								WOS:000177546100005						
J	Newman, TJ; Antonovics, J; Wilbur, HM				Newman, TJ; Antonovics, J; Wilbur, HM			Population dynamics with a refuge: Fractal basins and the suppression of chaos	THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY												We consider the effect of coupling an otherwise chaotic population to a refuge. A rich set of dynamical phenomena is uncovered. We consider two forms of density dependence in the active population: logistic and exponential. In the former case, the basin of attraction for stable population growth becomes fractal, and the bifurcation diagrams for the active and refuge populations are chaotic over a wide range of parameter space. In the case of exponential density dependence, the dynamics are unconditionally stable (in that the population size is always positive and finite), and chaotic behavior is completely eradicated for modest amounts of dispersal. We argue that the use of exponential density dependence is more appropriate, theoretically as well as empirically, in a model of refuge dynamics.

In all of the tests, only the Japanese pheromone blend attracted a significant number of male moths, while the Indian and Philippine pheromone blends showed no marked activity. The findings in Japan showed no evidence that moths of Philippine or Indian origin were able to migrate to Japan. The results from China also showed that most populations of C. medinalis in the Hangzhou region responded to the Japanese blend. This is consistent with the current hypothesis that most populations of C. medinalis in Japan are migrants from areas to the south of the Yangzhe Valley, including the region surrounding Hangzhou, China. Furthermore, populations in the Hangzhou region can not hibernate, but are considered migrants from the southernmost parts of China and southeast Asian countries such as Vietnam where they breed continuously. Consequently, at least some populations in these areas may respond to the Japanese pheromone blend.																	0007-4853					AUG	2002	92	4					295	299		10.1079/BER2002171								WOS:000177120100004	12191437					
J	Kraushaar, U; Goudet, J; Blanckenhorn, WU				Kraushaar, U; Goudet, J; Blanckenhorn, WU			Geographical and altitudinal population genetic structure of two dung fly species with contrasting mobility and temperature preference	HEREDITY												Local adaptation of populations requires some degree of spatio-temporal isolation. Previous studies of the two dung fly species Scathophaga stercoraria and Sepsis cynipsea have revealed low levels of geographic and altitudinal genetic differentiation in quantitative life history and morphological traits, but instead high degrees of phenotypic plasticity. These patterns suggest that gene flow is extensive despite considerable geographic barriers and large spatio-temporal variation in selection on body size and related traits. In this study we addressed this hypothesis by investigating genetic differentiation of dung fly populations throughout Switzerland based on the same 10 electrophoretic loci in each species. Overall, we found no significant geographic differentiation of populations for either species. This is inconsistent with the higher rates of gene flow expected due to better flying capacity of the larger S. stercoraria. However, heterozygote deficiencies within populations indicated structuring on a finer scale, seen for several loci in S. cynipsea, and for the locus PGM (Phosphoglucomutase) in S. stercoraria. Additionally, S. cynipsea showed a tendency towards a greater gene diversity at higher altitudes, mediated primarily by the locus MDH (malate dehydrogenase), at which a second allele was only present in populations above 1000 m. This may be caused by increased environmental stress at higher altitudes in this warm-adapted species. MDH might thus be a candidate locus subject to thermal selection in this species, but this remains to be corroborated by direct evidence. In S. stercoraria, no altitudinal variation was found.

Overexploitation is a major threat to the persistence of many species. A wide variety of approaches to setting 'sustainable' quotas for exploitation exist but there are major discrepancies between theory and practice, and only limited integration between different branches of exploitation literature. Here, we bring together and compare the efficacy of a range of different approaches to estimating sustainability. 2. A simulated population of a social mammal was used to provide data for, and compare the recommendations of, 10 widely used estimators for setting levels of sustainable exploitation. Estimators tested included four methods for setting sustainable levels of constant-effort harvesting, two approaches to assessing the sustainability of constant-yield harvesting, and four systems for setting thresholds below which harvesting should cease. 3. The method used to fit catch per unit effort data to a stock dynamic model had an important influence on the variance of recommendations. Recommendations were also affected by the length of data set available and the frequency of changes in exploitation effort. Observation-error estimators were more consistent and more conservative than equilibrium, effort-averaging and process-error approaches. Harvesting at the point of maximum productivity was found to be unstable in a noisy system, suggesting the need for considerable caution when using any of these estimators. 4. Constant-yield indices, developed for use in the bush meat trade, overestimated the point at which exploitation was likely to become highly unsustainable. Sociality was an important factor underlying this finding and the assessment of sustainability in constant-yield systems should give consideration to the effects of different social systems. 5. Overall, threshold-harvesting systems provided the highest mean yields in relation to extinction risk. However, the introduction of error into these systems, particularly in the form of less frequent censuses, greatly increased both variance in yields and risk of extinction.

One of these groups included at least 31 neonates and 2 postpartum females. In addition to spatio-temporal association of neonates and putative mothers, we observed a radio-tagged male prairie rattlesnake consecutively visit two natal sites,just before and just after parturition. Mean mass of neonates in two groups was below the range previously reported for this subspecies. Young-of-the-year (YOY) captured during ingress were longer and weighed more than neonates captured at birth. Feces collected from nine YOY captured at hibernacula contained pocket mouse (Perognathus spp.) remains. In contrast to other intensively studied Populations, most YOY in the Sand Hills appear to feed and grow before first hibernation.

We use long-term observations on the seasonal abundance and fat contents (a marker of physiological ageing) of ticks, and contemporaneous microclimate at three field sites in the UK, to establish a simple quantitative framework for the phenology (i.e. seasonal cycle of development) of I. ricinus as a foundation for a generic population model. An hour-degree tick inter-stadial development model, driven by soil temperature and including diapause, predicts the recruitment (i.e. emergence from the previous stage) of a single cohort of each stage of ticks each year in the autumn. The timing of predicted emergence coincides exactly with the new appearance of high-fat nymphs and adults in the autumn. Thereafter, fat contents declined steadily until unfed ticks with very low energy reserves disappeared from the questing population within about 1 year from their recruitment. Very few newly emerged ticks were counted on the vegetation in the autumn, but they appeared in increasing numbers through the following spring. Larger ticks became active and subsequently left the questing population before smaller ones. Questing tick population dynamics are determined by seasonal patterns of tick behaviour, host-contact rates and mortality rates, superimposed on a basal phenology that is much less complex than has hitherto been portrayed.

J	van Breukelen, F; Martin, SL				van Breukelen, F; Martin, SL			Reversible depression of transcription during hibernation	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY												Mammalian hibernators downregulate processes of energy production and consumption while maintaining cellular homeostasis. Energetic costs of transcription must be balanced with demands for gene products. Data from nuclear run-on assays indicate transcriptional initiation is reduced two fold in torpid golden-mantled ground squirrels (Spermophilus lateralis) as compared to euthermic animals between bouts of torpor. In addition, elongation rates across the temperature range experienced by hibernators indicate a virtual arrest of transcription at the low body temperatures of torpor. Finally, there is no seasonal compensation or species-specific adaptation for increased elongational capacity in the cold. Thus, it appears that hibernators are not specifically adapted to continue transcription during torpor. Taken together, these data indicate that transcription arrests during torpor because of a moderate depression of initiation and a more severe inhibition of elongation, largely due to temperature effects. Restoration of euthermic body temperatures during the interbout arousals reverses this transcriptional depression and permits gene expression.																	0174-1578					JUL	2002	172	5					355	361		10.1007/s00360-002-0256-1								WOS:000177201800001	12122451

Mean personal UV radiation exposure in the Antarctic location was 4.3 times greater than that in the Arctic location, even in the abence of ozone depletion. More than zenith angle accounted for the higher UV exposure. Widespread snow and ice covers, and probably less atmospheric pollution, caused higher personal exposures. Although the mean exposures were higher in the Antarctic location, the mean exposure ratio in the Antarctic (0.20 +/- 0.09) was similar to the value measured in the Arctic (0.27 +/- 0.09) on clear days. We use the Antarctic ratio to provide quantitative estimates of UV-radiation exposure for workers at the Geographical South Pole for the winter solstice under a constant 24-h photoperiod. Exposure ratios can be used to translate measurements of UV radiation by horizontally fixed spectroradiometers into estimates of the mean exposures expected in populations at polar latitudes, although variations between individuals are large. The data have implications for determining the UV exposures of indigenous high-latitude populations.

J	Holland, JB; Portyanko, VA; Hoffman, DL; Lee, M				Holland, JB; Portyanko, VA; Hoffman, DL; Lee, M			Genomic regions controlling vernalization and photoperiod responses in oat	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS												Oat genotypes vary for photoperiod and vernalization responses. Vernalization often promotes earlier flowering in fall-sown but not spring-sown cultivars. Longer photoperiods also promote earlier flowering, and the response to longer photoperiods tends to be greater in cultivars from higher latitudes. To investigate the genetic basis of photoperiod and vernalization responses in oat, we mapped QTLs for flowering time under four combinations of photoperiod and vernalization treatments in the Ogle x TAM O-301 mapping population in growth chambers. We also mapped QTLs for flowering time in early spring and late-spring field plantings to determine the genetic basis of response to early spring planting in oat. Three major flowering-time QTLs (on linkage groups OT8, OT31 and OT32) were detected in most conditions. QTLs with smaller effects on flowering were less-consistently observed among treatments. Both vernalization-sensitive and insensitive QTLs were discovered. Longer photoperiod or vernalization alone tended to decrease the effects of flowering-time QTLs. Applied together, longer photoperiod and vernalization interacted synergistically, often on the same genomic regions. Earlier spring planting conferred an attenuated vernalization treatment on seeds. The major flowering-time QTLs mapped in this study matched those mapped previously in the Kanota X Ogle oat mapping population. Between these two studies, we found a concordance of flowering-time QTLs, segregation distortion, and complex genetic linkages. These effects may all be related to chromosomal rearrangements in hexaploid oat. Comparative mapping between oat and other grasses will facilitate molecular analysis of vernalization response in oat.

J	Nagasaka, K; Ohsaki, N				Nagasaka, K; Ohsaki, N			Differences in host plant selection among three Athalia sawflies feeding on crucifers in Japan	ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												1. The ways of using host plants were compared among the three Athalia sawflies [A. japonica (Klug), A. rosae ruficornis Jakovlev, and A. infumata (Marlatt)] feeding on crucifers in Japan to determine whether host specialisation can explain the difference in their life-history traits. The occurrence of their larvae was examined on each crucifer species in the field, and the suitability of each crucifer species for the three successive steps of host use by the sawflies was evaluated: microhabitat selection by adult females, female oviposition, and larval growth. 2. There were 11 species of crucifer in the study area, and A. japonica , A. rosae , and A. infumata used nine, seven, and eight species respectively. Thus, sawfly host ranges overlapped. 3. Adult females of A. japonica , A. rosae , and A. infumata preferred shady clumps of crucifers, sunny clumps of crucifers, and disturbed areas respectively. 4. Unsuitable hosts for larval performance such as Brassica oleracea and Arabis plants were eliminated from the host ranges of the three sawflies. 5. Once they chose microhabitats, the suitability of each host plant for female oviposition and larval growth was similar. 6. Because of the divergent preferences for microhabitats, the host plants that were suitable for all the three steps were restricted to different sets of plants among the sawflies: Cardamine for A. japonica , cultivated crucifers (Raphanus and Brassica ) for A. rosae , and Rorippa for A. infumata . These plants could be recognised as the respective primary host plants. 7. The spatio-temporal distributions of primary hosts were consistent with and explained the pattern of diapause and migration of each sawfly, suggesting that host specialisation caused their life-history traits to differentiate.																	0307-6946					JUN	2002	27	3					326	336		10.1046/j.1365-2311.2002.00413.x								WOS:000175841800009

The fish were held in freshwater under simulated, natural light conditions (Tromso, 69degreesN) and natural water temperatures, and hypoosmoregulatory capacity was determined by seawater challenge tests between February and November. An improved hypoosmoregulatory capacity was seen in both strains at the time when their wild conspecifics migrate to the sea. The time when maximum hypoosmoregulatory capacity was achieved differed significantly between the two strains, suggesting that there may be genetic differences between the two populations in how environmental cues (e.g. temperature, photoperiod) entrain the development of seawater tolerance. The development and loss of hypoosmoregulatory capacity seemed to be more rapid and abrupt in the Svalbard charr than in the Hammerfest charr. This is hypothesised to be an adaptation to the stochastic and unpredictable variations in the time when the fish are allowed to migrate in the high-Arctic, and the need to prevent migration in years when the ice break occurs very late.																	0378-1909					JUN	2002	64	1-3					185	193		10.1023/A:1016097122119								WOS:000177002400015

(Fabaceae: Caesalpinoidea) in two geographically distinct areas of Japan. We compared life cycles to clarify influences of seasonal variation in temperature and host plant availability on insect life cycles. Results from a 4-yr study indicated that in Sagamihara (warmer climate): (1) B. dorsalis has a trivoltine life cycle, (2) it cannot reproduce during a period of more than I mo until new seeds become available in early or mid-August, and (3) it overwinters in several different developmental stages (young and old instars, and adults). However, studies over 3 yr in Tatsuno (cooler climate) indicated the following: (1) B. dorsalis has a bivoltine life cycle, (2) G. japonica phenology lags several weeks behind that in Sagamihara, and (3) B. dorsalis overwinters as diapausing larvae (late fourth instar) or as adults. Thus, the life cycles of B. dorsalis are more constrained in cooler areas, not only because of the direct effects of lower temperature on insect development, but also because of the phenological delay in host plant development.

J	Tauber, MJ; Tauber, CA				Tauber, MJ; Tauber, CA			Prolonged dormancy in Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Coleoptera : Chrysomelidae): A ten-year field study with implications for crop rotation	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												This 10-yr field study examined prolonged dormancy (dormancy of more than 1 yr) in Colorado potato beetles, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say), from Upstate New York. The research focused on whether the life cycle of the Colorado potato beetle could reduce the effectiveness of crop rotation as a pest management tactic. One set of experiments quantified variation in the occurrence and duration of prolonged dormancy in a natural population. A second set of experiments tested the effect of artificial selection for increased incidence of prolonged dormancy. Of the approximate to12,600 unselected beetles in the field cages overall survival (= % emergence) averaged 56.5 +/- 18.4% (mean +/- SD, range = 23.5-84.3%, n = 19 cages). Most (97.7%) of the emerging beetles surfaced after one winter; the remainder (2.3%) emerged after more than one winter in dormancy. The range of variation in the incidence of prolonged dormancy among the experimental cages during the 10-yr period was 0-7.2%. The incidence of emergence from prolonged dormancy was higher among beetles from the first summer-generation [mean +/-SD = 3.0 +/- 2.0% (10 cages)] than from the second [1.0 +/- 1.5 (7 cages)], and significantly more females than males emerged from prolonged dormancy (female:male = 97:64). Most (approximate to70%) of the beetles that underwent prolonged dormancy emerged after two winters in diapause; the majority of the remainder (approximate to29%) emerged after 3-7 yr in diapause; and, one beetle (approximate to1%) emerged after 9 yr. Artificial selection for prolonged dormancy over three generations did not result in a significant increase in the incidence of delayed emergence, nor did it result in incidences of prolonged dormancy greater than those in the controls (unselected field-reared beetles and lines selected for 1-yr dormancy). From our results, we conclude that the Colorado potato beetle has considerable variation in both the incidence and duration of prolonged dormancy, and that this variation has strong environmental and genetic determinants. Viewed in the context of the beetle's life history, these findings lead us to suggest that the evolution of resistance to crop rotation would require strong and sustained selection over large areas.																	0046-225X					JUN	2002	31	3					499	504		10.1603/0046-225X-31.3.499								WOS:000178326000010

The diapause rate reaches 100% in early October. Diapause intensity decreases gradually from early October and diapause terminates in early February. The fresh body weight of diapausing pupae is 1.6 times that of non-diapausing pupae. The main cryoprotectant in P. ringoniella pupae is trehalose. Three stages are distinguishable as indicated by the correlations between diapause intensity, levels of cold hardiness and the trehalose content: diapause induction occurred in October, diapause development from November to December, and post-diapause quiescence from January to April. During diapause induction, the pupae accumulate low levels of trehalose and do not survive exposure to -15 degreesC. During diapause development, the pupae gradually accumulate more trehalose and show some ability to survive exposure to -15 degreesC, but not to -20 degreesC. During post-diapause quiescence, the pupae accumulate relatively more trehalose and cold hardiness fully develops, but decreases quickly in April. The trehalose content in pupae sampled in December is unaffected by acclimation temperatures in the range 0-30 degreesC, but decreases in pupae sampled in March after acclimation at temperatures from 5 to 15 degreesC. These results suggest that overwintering pupae of P. ringoniella have the ability to accumulate trehalose and develop a high level of cold hardiness during diapause development.																	0307-6962					JUN	2002	27	2					92	96		10.1046/j.1365-3032.2002.00273.x								WOS:000175861800002

J	Toepfer, S; Gu, HN; Dorn, S				Toepfer, S; Gu, HN; Dorn, S			Phenological analysis of spring colonisation of apple trees by Anthonomus pomorum	ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA												Adult apple blossom weevils, Anthonomus pomorum (L.) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), leave their overwintering sites within and outside orchards to colonise apple trees in early spring. This study was conducted to characterize the temporal pattern of spring colonization of apple trees by overwintered weevils in relation to climatic conditions and apple bud stages, based on multiple mark-release-recapture experiments and field observations of foraging activities of weevils. The process of spring colonization of apple trees by overwintered weevils was related to thermal time totals above 0 degreesC. The dispersal into orchards initiated when the thermal time totals reached 161+/-27 (s.d.) degree-days (DD) calculated from January 1, or 117+/-16 DD from February 1. The daily dispersal speed of individual weevils within orchards was determined primarily by the maximum daily temperature, whereas crawling, feeding, and mating activities of weevils on apple trees were influenced by the mean evening temperature between 18:00 and 22:00 hours. On the other hand, the spring colonization of overwintered weevils was not synchronized with any specific apple bud stage, though the level of female foraging and reproductive activities on apple trees was related to apple bud stages. The overwintered weevils initiated dispersal into orchards over a wide range of bud developmental stages from little silver greenish tip B (51) to the mouse-ear stage C3 (54). These findings are discussed in relation to the ecology and pest management of this insect.																	0013-8703					MAY	2002	103	2					151	159		10.1046/j.1570-7458.2002.00969.x								WOS:000178097000006						
J	Tanaka, S				Tanaka, S			Temperature acclimation in overwintering nymphs of a cockroach, Periplaneta japonica: walking on ice	JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY												Nymphs of the Yamato cockroach, Periplaneta japonica, showed a seasonal change in the ability to move at low temperature. Laboratory-reared nymphs buried in ice for 15 min-3 h took about 600 s to get up at 25 degreesC after being placed with their dorsal surface on the floor of a Petri dish. The mean time to get up at 25 degreesC (recovering time) after 15 or 60-min burial in ice was relatively long in early autumn, decreased rapidly in autumn, reached a minimal level in winter (<100 s) and increased in spring. Temperature was responsible for this seasonal change in physiology, and neither photoperiod nor diapause status was important. Recovering time depended on the acclimation temperature and its duration. For a 10-day exposure in a range of 0-25 &DEG;C, the lower the temperature the shorter the recovering. Longer periods of acclimation at these temperatures tended to shorten recovering time. The acquisition of the ability to move on ice is a seasonal phenomenon unique to P. japonica. No comparable response was found in three other cockroaches including two sub-tropical species (Periplaneta americana and Opisthoplatia orientalis) and a temperate species (Blattela nipponica).

J	Krapu, GL; Sargeant, GA; Perkins, AEH				Krapu, GL; Sargeant, GA; Perkins, AEH			Does increasing daylength control seasonal changes in clutch sizes of Northern Pintails (Anas acuta)?	AUK												We evaluated spatiotemporal variation ill Clutch sizes of Northern Pintails (pintails; Anas actua) nesting in California (1985 to 1996),North Dakota (1982 to 1985),Saskatchewan (1982 to 1985) and Alaska (1991 to 1993) to determine whether seasonal declines in Clutch size varied in ways that were consistent with a controlling influence of increasing day length. Pintails began nesting in mid-March in California, mid-April in North Dakota and Saskatchewan, and mid-May in Alaska. Observed durations of nesting were 70 +/- 2.6 days (SE) in California, 60 +/- 6.3 days in North Dakota, 66 +/- 1.3 days in Saskatchewan, and 42 +/- 0.7 days in Alaska. Annual differences were the principal source of variation in mean clutch sizes ((&sigma;) over cap (2)(Y) = 0.15, SE = 0.049), which varied little among Study locations ((&sigma;) over cap (2)(A) = 0.002, SE = 0.013). Predicted rates of seasonal decline in Clutch sizes increased with latitude early in the nesting season, but declined as the nesting season progressed, except in California. Rates of decline in clutch sizes thus were not directly related to rates of increase in day length. Predicted declines in numbers of eggs per clutch over the nesting season were similar for all four locations (range, 3.05-3.12) despite wide variation ill durations of nesting. Evidence suggests that reduced nutrient availability during nesting contributes to a higher rate of decline in clutch sizes in Alaska than in temperate regions. Pintails that nest early lay large initial clutches, but thereafter clutch sizes decline rapidly and breeding terminates early. This reproductive strategy is adaptive because young that hatch earliest exhibit the highest survival rates; however, the conversion of grassland to cropland oil the primary prairie breeding grounds has reduced hatching rates Of Clutches laid early in the nesting season Under these conditions, the limited capacity to renest in late spring on their prairie breeding grounds Probably has contributed to Pintail population declines.

In contrast, interspecific hybrids (P. glaucus mother x P. canadensis father) had significant adult eclosion or pupal survival at both 30degrees and 36degreesC. All surviving hybrid pupae were only females (the heterogametic sex, which are known to express the prolonged diapause due to Haldane effects). The southern species, P. troilus, had almost all (81%) normal (non-deformed) adults eclose at 30degreesC, whereas only 20% of the A canadensis females and ca 30% or the A canadensis males eclosed to produce non-deformed adults. Unlike the case with P. troilus and P. canadensis, no hybrid females eclosed at 30degreesC (only males did). Unlike P. troilus and P. canadensis pupae, hybrid (female) pupae remain viable, some of which have already successfully emerged after the chamber experiments. A follow-up study using P. glaucus, P. canadensis (from Vermont), and their hybrids with more normal lower thermal regimes included (27degrees, 30degrees, 33degrees, and 36degreesC) again showed higher hybrid survival as uneclosed (living) pupae at 36degreesC. In addition, A glaucus and P. canadensis showed high mortality and wing deformity of eclosing adults at 36degreesC, suggesting that geographic source of the P. canadensis may reflect differential tolerances of the extreme 36degreesC temperature.																	0906-7590					APR	2002	25	2					184	192		10.1034/j.1600-0587.2002.250206.x								WOS:000174928500006						
J	White, MA; Nemani, RR; Thornton, PE; Running, SW				White, MA; Nemani, RR; Thornton, PE; Running, SW			Satellite evidence of phenological differences between urbanized and rural areas of the eastern United States deciduous broadleaf forest	ECOSYSTEMS												We used a 10-year record (1990-99) of composited and cloud-screened reflectances from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) to test for phenological differences between urban and rural areas in the eastern United States deciduous broadleaf forest (DBF). We hypothesized that well-documented urban heat island effects would be associated with alterations in temperature-sensitive vegetation phenology. Our objectives were thus (a) to investigate possible differences in the start of the growing season (SOS) and end of the growing season (EOS) between the urban and DBF land covers, (b) to investigate related differences in greenness amplitude and fractional cover, and (c) to develop a generalized additive model (GAM) to predict the spatial variation of observed differences. By analyzing individual 1degrees latitude by 1degrees longitude blocks, we found that, on average, urbanization is associated with a growing season expansion of 7.6 days. Most of this effect is caused by an earlier SOS in urban areas. In all cases, urban regions had lower fractional cover and greenness amplitude. The GAM model failed to produce a viable model for differences in EOS, probably because it is dominated by photoperiod controls with only a minor temperature impact. SOS differences were predicted with an accuracy of about 2.4 days, with a GAM consisting of smoothed functions of mean annual average temperature, urban fractional cover, and the urban vs DBF greenness amplitude difference. We speculate that evidence of a phenoiogical response to warming indicates that global warming, without reduction in DBF vegetation cover and greenness amplitude, may increase carbon sequestration in mesic deciduous forests.

I. Phenology, biomass production and reproductive patterns	PLANT ECOLOGY												Burr Medic (Medicago polymorpha) is a widespread, polymorphic annual legume of Mediterranean origin, and as a self-reseeding, highly effective nitrogen fixer it has important value in various dryland farming systems. In central Chile, it is naturalized along a 1000 km long environmental gradient, from an arid zone (29degrees-31degrees S) to a perhumid one (37degrees-38degrees24' S). Comparative and experimental studies of its ecotypic differentiation patterns along this gradient should be useful in elucidating the evolutionary forces at work along environmental gradients, and also for efforts to select annual legumes for pastures and fallow field improvement in mediterranean climate areas. In this first paper of a two-part series, we present results of two common-environment experiments conducted at a subhumid site in central Chile to compare vegetative and reproductive traits in 69 populations of Burr Medic collected in 1988 and 1994. Multivariate analyses based on 11 phenological and agronomic characters, including phenology and biomass accumulation, winter vigour and degree of hard-seededness, showed that three principal components (PCs) explained nearly 70% of total variability, in both collections. For the larger collection (1988), the diagram of dispersion for the first two PCs - phenology, winter vigour and above-ground biomass - provided good discrimination between accessions from arid-semiarid and humid-perhumid mediterranean zones. Onset of flowering was positively correlated with both latitude and longitude, as well as mean annual precipitation/potential evapotranspiration (PP/ETP) of collecting site; days from first flower to pod ripening was negatively correlated with PP/ETP. In contrast to reports from Syria and Sardinia, no clear trends in Burr Medic seed or pod-related traits was found along the Chilean gradient, apart from the concentration of spiny pod accessions in the southern, more mesic end of the gradient. Winter vigour (according to a semi-quantitative analysis of growth) was greater in accessions from the warmer, arid and semiarid zones than in those from cooler, subhumid to humid ones. Both winter vigour and harvest index were negatively correlated with days to first flower. Applied and evolutionary aspects of the results are briefly discussed.				del Pozo, Alejandro/C-1423-2012													1385-0237					APR	2002	159	2					119	130		10.1023/A:1015506914038								WOS:000175636900001

In one experiment, adults were subjected to constant temperatures from 3 to 33degreesC at 3degreesC intervals and in another experiment adults were subjected to four photoperiods at 21degreesC. Oviposition was monitored for all treatments. Adults fed at all temperatures from 3 to 33degreesC and oviposited at temperatures between 18 and 30degreesC. The longest preoviposition period (32 d) and the fewest total number of eggs (2) were observed at 18degreesC. The shortest preoviposition period (15 d) and the largest total number of eggs (282) were observed at 27degreesC. A temperature range of 21-27degreesC appeared to be optimum for oviposition. Within this range, the lowest mortality, shortest preoviposition period, longest oviposition period, and greatest total number of eggs were observed. Weevils oviposited at all photoperiods. Length of preoviposition period and egg viability did not vary significantly among photoperiod treatments. Adults oviposited an average of 15 eggs at 12:12 (L:D) h and an average of 148 eggs at 18:6 h (L:D) h. A linear regression model predicted an increase of 23 cumulative eggs laid for each 2-h increase of daylength.																	0013-8746					MAR	2002	95	2					231	235		10.1603/0013-8746(2002)095[0231:IOTAPO]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000178373100013

We find that the extent of aspartic acid racemization in permafrost cores increases very slowly up to an age of similar to25,000 years (around 5 m in depth). The apparent temperature of racernization over the age range of 0-25,000 years, determined using measured aspartic acid racernization rate constants, is -19degreesC. This apparent racernization temperature, is significantly lower than the measured environmental temperature (-11 to -13degreesC) and suggests active recycling Of D-aspartic acid in Siberian permafrost up to, an age of around 25,000 years. This indicates that permafrost organisms are capable of repairing some molecular damage incurred while in a "dormant" state over geologic time.																	1531-1074					SPR	2002	2	1					77	82		10.1089/153110702753621358								WOS:000182463400005	12449856					
J	O'Toole, L; Fielding, AH; Haworth, PF				O'Toole, L; Fielding, AH; Haworth, PF			Re-introduction of the golden eagle into the Republic of Ireland	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												The golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) became extinct in the Republic of Ireland in about 1912. Historical evidence suggests that, in the early nineteenth century, the population exceeded 50 pairs. It is thought that the extinction was a consequence of persecution and habitat change. Because there seems little chance of natural recolonisation a re-introduction programme has been developed. It is intended to release up to 15 birds per year for 5 years, starting in 2001. Single chicks will be obtained from Scottish nests with twins. The ways in which this project adheres to the six main IUCN re-introduction criteria are addressed. Two simulation models are described. The first, GEPM demonstrates that the removal of chicks from Scottish nests should not have a detrimental effect on the Scottish population. The second model predicts the probable home range occupancy if only 12 birds are released each year. It is expected that between 3 and 13 ranges will be occupied by 2007. The imprecision in this estimate is a consequence of uncertainty about juvenile survival rates. The rationale behind our reintroduction scheme is outlined to stimulate debate about the development of good practice. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The tests were done at five temperatures between 15 and 30 degreesC, using a L16:D8 photoperiod and 65 +/- 5% r.h. Most eggs (range 85 to 90%) hatched at 15 and 20 degreesC. Incubation period was shortest at 27.5 degreesC (8.45 and 8.38 days on eggplant and tomato, respectively). Preoviposition was also shortest at 27.5 degreesC (5.10 and 4.75 days on eggplant and tomato, respectively) whereas fecundity was highest at 20 degreesC (213.90 and 228.25 eggs on eggplant and tomato, respectively). Maximum longevity of females was at 15 degreesC (122.40 and 129.35 days on eggplant and tomato, respectively). Mean generation time was longest at 15 degreesC on both host plants (122.75 and 124.64 days, respectively). The intrinsic rate of increase of M. pygmaeus was highest at 27.5 degreesC with similar values on eggplant (0.0981 day(-)1) and tomato (0.1040 day(-)1). Doubling time was shortest at 27.5 degreesC (7.06 and 6.67 days on eggplant and tomato, respectively) and, also, finite rate of increase was highest at 27.5 degreesC (1.1031 and 1.1096 on eggplant and tomato, respectively). The results show that the predator M. pygmaeus develops well on the aphid M. persicae or on the whitefly T. vaporariorum, both of which are important pests of vegetable crops. This predator is also well adapted to the temperatures that occur both in greenhouses and in the open field in the Mediterranean region. Compared to other natural enemies of whiteflies, such as Encarsia formosa Gahan (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae), Macrolophus pygmaeus can increase at relatively low temperatures.																	0013-8703					MAR	2002	102	3					261	272		10.1046/j.1570-7458.2002.00947.x								WOS:000177169900006

In that respect, pudu is similar to roe deer. Whereas the antler cycle in some deer species, such as roe deer or white-tailed deer, is very sensitive to variation of testosterone, in other cervids, such as fallow deer or reindeer, a blockade of androgens with cyproterone acetate (CA) has little or no effect on the timing of the antler casting. In order to test the sensitivity of pudu antlers to variations of androgens, CA (administered 2x weekly at 50 mg/buck) was injected intramuscularly for 3 weeks in 5 adult male pudu, starting February 19 (late summer). Four other males of similar age served as controls. The experiment was performed at the University of Concepcion, Chile, latitude 36.6degreesS. Blood samples were taken once a week between January 19 and April 3. In CA-treated bucks, the antlers were cast approximately 3 weeks after the initiation of CA treatment and a new antler growth began almost immediately. The antlers reached about 5 cm in length, before ceasing to grow at the end of April, when they became mineralized and were subsequently polished. CA had no effect on the already declining levels of LH. Plasma levels of testosterone in controls increased from February 15, whereas in CA-treated bucks remained depresses until March 21. It is concluded that similarly to white-tailed deer, the antler cycle of Southern pudu is very sensitive to manipulation of androgen levels. J. Exp. Zool. 292:393-401, 2002.

We quantified components of surface activity in the field on a daily basis in individual degus near the time of the summer solstice, when conditions of heat and aridity were also at a seasonal extreme, in order to answer the following questions. Does the absolute time available for surface activity limit performance? Does the allocation of time and energy for locomotion place a functionally significant limitation on overall energy balance and performance? Degus spent about 2/3 of their above-ground time foraging; they remained stationary about 88 % of the time, walked around slowly about 10 %, and were running rapidly from one point to another only about 2 % of the time. Net locomotion costs (for walking and running combined) were computed to be only 2.2 % of total daily energy expenditure. This low net allocation of time and energy to locomotion, taken together with abundant distribution of plant food over the extremely small home range, suggests that the daily performance of degus is not limited by the absolute amount of time available under normal conditions at the summer solstice (seasonal extreme of day length, heat, and aridity). Total energy demands can be met by as little as 4.5 h surface activity per day. Our empirical observations, together with a simple computational model of time and energy expenditure, provide a useful validation of the impact of activity on the overall energy balance of a free-living rodent. The small impact of locomotion on the total energy budget is an economy of the behavior of these animals, and the rapid mode of locomotion allows them to minimize predation risks. We believe that this kind of quantitative analysis of energy expenditure associated with behavior in the field can contribute a useful basis for theoretically based time-energy modeling.

In an effort to transfer this trait to cultivated species of Gossypium, distant hybridization was effected between G. herbaceum race wightianum (2n = 2x = 26) and an Australian species G. australe. This species has its origin in and zones of Australia, and behaved as facultative cleistogamous in transitional tracts of India. Upon two years of crossing only 0.9% success was achieved to obtain the crossed seeds. The F-1 seeds of the hybrid possessed dormancy. The F-1 plant was sterile due to abortive ovary, and 8-11% of pollen fertility was noticed. The plants have also been found to be of the best genetic stocks for nectar character, bract shape, calyx morphology and other inflorescence traits as both the parents exhibited diversity for many traits. The cross is expected to carry some genetic load, as the species involved are genetically and geographically distant.																	0011-3891					FEB 25	2002	82	4					434	439										WOS:000174261200025						
J	Fischer, K; Fiedler, K				Fischer, K; Fiedler, K			Life-history plasticity in the butterfly Lycaena hippothoe: local adaptations and trade-offs	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY												Life-history theory predicts some cost to be associated with short development time, the most frequently assumed being small adult size. Alternatively, insects may increase developmental rates and grow fast to a larger size. Seasonal environments should select for phenotypic plasticity in growth and development, based on the need to complete development up to the diapausing stage before the onset of unfavourable season. Nevertheless, there must be some limit beyond which a compensation for a shorter development cannot be achieved. By comparing three geographically isolated populations of Lycaena hippothoe in common environments we show that in the Hungarian population development time seems to be traded off against size at maturity. This population is the only bivoltine one within this principally monovoltine species. Thus, realization of an additional generation per year, achieved through largely reduced development times, appears to carry the cost of substantially lower adult weights compared with other populations. In contrast, differences in development time in two monovoltine populations were not accompanied by a trade-off between development time and size. These results suggest that clear trade-offs are restricted to stressful situations, when compensation by an increase in growth rates is no longer feasible. We suggest the particularly short development time in the Hungarian population (facilitating a second generation), as well as the shorter development in an alpine (short vegetation period) compared with a western German population, to be adaptations to local climatic conditions.

A robust daily rhythm of body temperature was observed in all animals. The rhythm had a mean level of 38.3degreesC and a range of excursion of 1.0degreesC. Temperature started its daily ascent at dawn each day and reached a maximum 14 hours later. Body temperature of 5 of the horses was studied for 10 more days under constant illumination. The rhythm persisted under this condition, although with a slightly longer period of 24.2 h, which confirms the endogenous nature of the rhythm. Despite the fact that the body size of the horse is several orders of magnitude greater than that of rodents, the various parameters of the body temperature rhythm of the horse are similar to those of several species of rodents previously studied.

Previous studies suggest that this negative effect by E. hermaphroditum may be explained, at least in part, by the release of phenolic compounds, particularly batatasin-III, from foliage to soil. In this pilot study, we evaluated the effect of batatasin-III on photosynthesis by applying the compound (0.1, 1.0, or 2.8 mM) directly to the transpiration stream of intact Spinacia oleracea L. (spinach) and Betula pendula L. (birch) leaves. Within the concentration range used, batatasin-III had a small, but significant, effect on photosynthesis. The strongest effect was found on CO2 assimilation, but there were also significant effects on respiration and on maximum quantum yield of chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv / Fm). In spinach leaves treated with 2.8 mM of batatasin-III, a 14 % decrease in Fv / Fm-685 coincided with a 30 % inhibition of CO2 assimilation rates. It is possible, that the inhibition of photosynthesis by batatasin-III was caused by direct effects on chloroplast membrane energization processes and subsequent control on the primary photochemistry of PSII. The variable fluorescence kinetics indicated that maximum quantum yield of variable fluorescence of PSII was depressed while continued upstream transported allowed oxidation of the primary electron acceptor.

The virus is transmitted, probably in a semi-persistent manner, by the large raspberry aphid, Amphorophora idaei in Europe, and A. agathonica in North America. The particles of RYNV are bacilliform in shape and measure 80-150 x 25-30 nm, similar to those of badnaviruses. A 1.7 kb fragment of the viral DNA was amplified by PCR and then directly sequenced. Analysis of this sequence suggests that RYNV is possibly a distinct species in the genus Badnavirus and is most closely related to Gooseberry vein banding associated virus (GVBAV) and Spiraea yellow leaf spot vines, two other badnaviruses described recently. Using the sequence derived from the PCR-amplified viral DNA fragment, RYNV-specific primers were designed and used in PCR to assay for RYNV in a range of Rubus germplasm infected with RYNV, with other unrelated viruses and virus-like diseases found in Rubus, and in healthy plants. RYNV was detected in all glasshouse cultures of RYNV-infected plants, whether alone or in complex infections with other viruses, but not from healthy Rubus plants, nor from plants infected with other viruses. It was also detected in field-grown raspberry plants with and without symptoms of RVBMD and in raspberry plants infected with RYNV by viruliferous A. idaei. RYNV was also detected by PCR in A. idaei following access feeds on RYNV-infected plants of 1 h or more. PCR failed to amplify DNA from gooseberry infected with GVBAV confirming the specificity of the RYNV analysis. PCR detection of RYNV in dormant raspberry buds allows assays to be made outside the natural growing season, providing a useful application for plant introduction and quarantine programmes.

A three-year study of soil seed bank was conducted in an area infested with Rhazya stricta Decne. The object of the study was to evaluate annual and seasonal variations in the soil seed bank over three degrees of infestation by R. stricta (loss, moderate, and heavy). Soil samples were placed in germination trays in a growth chamber and irrigated. Emerging seedlings were identified and counted by,species. Species were grouped into shrubs, legumes, grasses, and forbs. Results revealed the presence of seeds of 44 species, mostly annuals. Low similarity was observed between above-ground vegetation and soil seed components. Significant annual and seasonal variations were observed among groups of species. Generally, seed bank size and species richness were higher under the lower level of R. stricta infestation. It is concluded drat most of the desirable species that have the potential of growing in the area are disappearing.

They exhibit daily fluctuations in body temperature (T-b) and use torpor to various degrees throughout much of their range. Echidnas elsewhere are commonly diurnal except during hot weather. This study used temperature-sensitive radio-transmitters to investigate the activity patterns and temperature relations of echidnas in the relatively hot, dry climate of south-west Queensland with respect to temperature and photoperiod. During activity, echidnas were characterised by rising, but not necessarily high, T(b)s. Activity was seen only within an ambient temperature range (as measured in a nearby Stevenson Screen: T-ss) of 9-33degreesC so that activity was seen during the day and at night during the cool weather but only at night in summer. Echidnas used caves, burrows and logs when inactive. T(b)s of inactive echidnas declined except when affected by rising ambient temperatures, as determined within these shelters (T-a). In summer, T(b)s of echidnas in these shelters changed little or rose with increasing T-a to levels even higher than in active echidnas. Torpor was used by echidnas for periods up to nine days during winter and occasionally for up to one day during summer. Due to the difficulty of identifying the occurrence of torpor from T-b alone in warm conditions, the possibility that echidnas utilise torpor for less than one day remains inconclusive. Nevertheless, at least five bouts of torpor were identified in four (of eight) echidnas during winter/spring and two bouts of torpor from two echidnas in summer.																	0004-959X						2002	50	5					461	475		10.1071/ZO01080								WOS:000179756800002						
J	Witt, ABR; Edwards, PB				Witt, ABR; Edwards, PB			Aspects of the biology, distribution, and host range of Crioceris sp (Col.: Chrysomelidae : Criocerinae), a potential biological control agent for Asparagus asparagoides in Australia	BIOLOGICAL CONTROL												Aspects of the biology, distribution, and host range of Crioceris sp. (Chrysomelidae: Criocerinae), a potential biocontrol agent for Asparagus asparagoides (L.) W. Wight (bridal creeper) in Australia, were ascertained from studies in its native range in South Africa. In the laboratory, adults oviposited on new growth of A asparagoides within 10 days of emergence and laid an average of 148 eggs per female. Eggs maintained at 15, 20, and 30degreesC eclosed after 8.7, 5.1, and 3.6 days, respectively. Larvae passed through four instars, with the final instar constructing a pupal case in the soil. Only 29% of adults from laboratory cultures emerged from dry pupal cases after an average of 75.9 days. Submerging pupal cases in water for short periods greatly enhanced adult emergence. Adults can live longer than 6 months. Crioceris sp. was mainly found on A. asparagoides and A. densiflorus/aethiopicus in winter-rainfall and even-rainfall areas. Larval and adult specificity testing indicated that this species could complete its development only on species within the Asparagaceae. Crioceris sp. is therefore a promising candidate for the control of A. asparagoides in Australia.

We compared the presence of insect remains (mainly dormant larvae) in the winter diet of two reed bunting subspecies, small billed E. s. schoeniclus and large billed E. s. intermedia and studied the distribution of this resource within reed (Phragmites sp.) stems in seven north Italian localities where the two subspecies breed (three schoeniclus and four intermedia populations). We also tested if the distributions of winter insect resources and breeding populations of the large bill subspecies overlapped. The distribution of the larvae in reed stems matched closely the distribution of large billed breeding populations. The winter diets of the two subspecies were significantly different in terms of frequency of insect remains. These results, when compared to theoretical models of parapatric distribution, suggest that the two subspecies may be subject to ecological (vicariant) selection maintaining their reproductive isolation.

The large numbers of dogs kept formerly by the indigenous Siberian Yupik residents of the island provided an extension of the natural cycle on the tundra into villages, where many voles, Microtus oeconomus, lived in and around the dwellings. Following preliminary investigations during 1950-1955 [2], a long-term investigation was begun on the island in 1956. After 4 years of intensive field work, 11 years were spent in the field and laboratory to confirm the validity of earlier findings. An environmental chamber permitted the keeping of laboratory-reared voles under conditions of temperature, humidity, and photoperiod that could be adjusted to duplicate those of the island for any time of the year. Until about 1975, work was conducted in the western half of the island, including the village of Gambell, which could be reached by air from the Alaskan mainland. From 1980-1997, work was concentrated at Savoonga and vicinity. The acquisition of epidemiological data was a major objective during the entire period of our investigations. For present purposes, epidemiologic data obtained on the island are taken as a basis for comparison of findings in other endemic regions, in order to discern differences or similarities that may be useful in assessing risk-factors under diverse biotic conditions.																	1566-7693		1-58603-220-8				2002	341						309	325										WOS:000174597300027

The Bowen ratio/energy balance (BREB) technique was used to measure CO2 fluxes over a grazed mixed-grass prairie and a seeded western wheatgrass [Pascopyrum smithii (Rybd) Love] site at Mandan, ND from 24 April to 26 October in 1996, 1997, and 1998. Above-ground biomass and leaf area index (LAI) were measured about every 21 days throughout the season. Root biomass and soil organic C and N content were determined to 110 cm depth in selected increments about mid-July each year. Peak above-ground biomass and LAI coincided with peak fluxes and occurred between mid-July to early August. Biomass averaged 1227 and 1726 kg ha(-1) and LAI 0.44 and 0.59, for prairie and western wheatgrass, respectively. Average CO2 flux for the growing season was 279 g CO2 m(-2) for prairie and 218 g CO2 m(-2) for western wheatgrass (positive flux is CO2 uptake and negative flux is CO2 loss to the atmosphere). Using prior measured dormant season CO2 fluxes from the prairie sites gave annual flux estimates that ranged from -131 to 128 g CO2 m(-2) for western wheatgrass and from -70 to 189 g CO2 m(-2) for the prairie. This wide range in calculated annual fluxes suggests that additional research is required concerning dormant season flux measurements to obtain accurate estimates of annual CO, fluxes. These results suggest Northern Great Plains mixed-grass prairie grasslands can either be a sink or a source for atmospheric CO2 or near equilibrium, depending on the magnitude of the dormant season flux.

J	Purse, BV; Thompson, DJ				Purse, BV; Thompson, DJ			Voltinism and larval growth pattern in Coenagrion mercuriale (Odonata : Coenagrionidae) at its northern range margin	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY												Voltinism and larval growth pattern were investigated in an edge-of-range population of Coenagrion mercuriale, Coenagrion mercuriale is semi-voltine in Britain and growth is inhibited in winter. The 2(nd) year group overwinters in a range of instars between the antepenultimate and final instar consistent with the early, asynchronous emergence pattern of this species. A facultative autumnal diapause in the penultimate instar is the most likely mode of seasonal regulation. The broad size distribution of larvae produced by this growth pattern was wider than that found in co-occurring populations of Pyrrhosoma nymphula, a "spring" species with synchronous emergence. The broad size distributions may lead to considerable intraspecific interference between C mercuriale larvae. Sex ratio in the last three larval instars of C. mercuriale did not differ significantly from unity. A laboratory investigation of the effect of temperature and photoperiod on growth and diapause in C mercuriale is recommended to determine whether high minimum temperature thresholds for development limit both the width of the temporal niche and microhabitat use by this species at its range margin.

J	Danks, HV				Danks, HV			The range of insect dormancy responses	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY					4th European Workshop on Invertebrate Ecophysiology	SEP 09-14, 2001	ST PETERSBURG STATE UNIV, ST PETERSBURG, RUSSIA		ST PETERSBURG STATE UNIV			Insect dormancy responses, in the broad sense of modifications of development, are examined from a general perspective. The range of responses is extraordinarily wide because environments are diverse, different taxa have different evolutionary histories, adaptations are needed for both seasonal timing and resistance to adversity, and not only development but also many other aspects of the life-cycle must be coordinated. Developmental options are illustrated by examining the wide range of ways in which development can be modified, the fact that each individual response consists of several components, and the different potential durations of the life-cycle. The concepts of alternative life-cycle pathways (chosen according to current and likely future environmental conditions) and of active and passive default responses are treated. Also introduced are aspects of variation and trade-offs. Some general conclusions that help in understanding dormancy responses emerge from such an examination. Many options are available (cf. Table 1). The nature of the habitat, especially its predictability, determines the potential effectiveness of many of the developmental options. Any particular set of responses reflects evolutionary history and hence depends on past as well as current environments. It is not necessarily obvious what kinds of selection, especially requirements for timing versus resistance to adversity, explain a particular life cycle. Life-cycle pathways have multiple components, so that components cannot be analyzed in isolation. A given feature, such as delayed development, can have multiple roles. Default responses can be either active (development continues unless signalled otherwise) or passive (development stops unless signalled otherwise), making necessary a broad approach to understanding the action of environmental cues. Even relatively minor effects that fine-tune dormancy responses enhance survival, but may be difficult to detect or measure. Trade-offs are not inevitable, not only when certain resources are surplus, but also because resources in very short supply (constraints) cannot be traded off. Life-cycle components are widely, but not universally, coordinated. These conclusions confirm that the range of dormancy responses is wider, more complex and more integrated than has often been recognized.																	1802-8829						2002	99	2					127	142		10.14411/eje.2002.021								WOS:000177174200003						
J	Masaki, S				Masaki, S			Ecophysiological consequences of variability in diapause intensity	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY					4th European Workshop on Invertebrate Ecophysiology	SEP 09-14, 2001	ST PETERSBURG STATE UNIV, ST PETERSBURG, RUSSIA		ST PETERSBURG STATE UNIV			Diapause intensity (DI) is a physiological trait represented by the duration of diapause under given conditions of environment. In many species, it is highly variable, probably being controlled by multiple genes and tends to form a cline in response to the latitudinal gradient of selection pressure. DI clines could be established artificially by crossing between lines of a cricket selected for different levels of DI, indicating the importance of genetic factors in the adaptive variation of DI. However, DI may be modified in response to seasonal cues both before and after the onset of diapause. Polymorphism in the intensity of prolonged diapause may split adults of a single population to emerge in different years. A unimodal distribution of DI may also result in polymodal termination of diapause, if DI variation is so large that chilling in one winter is not enough to terminate diapause for all members of a population. Bimodal termination of diapause after overwintering suggests heterogeneity in the final phase of diapause that requires high temperatures in spring. Polymodal termination of diapause subserves a bet-hedging strategy. Variability in DI thus provides insects with an important means of adaptation to their environments changing in space and time.																	1210-5759						2002	99	2					143	154		10.14411/eje.2002.022								WOS:000177174200004						
J	Hodek, I				Hodek, I			Controversial aspects of diapause development	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY					4th European Workshop on Invertebrate Ecophysiology	SEP 09-14, 2001	ST PETERSBURG STATE UNIV, ST PETERSBURG, RUSSIA		ST PETERSBURG STATE UNIV			Although some parts of diapause development have been clarified up by endocrinologists, knowledge of the underlying processes remains insufficient. The survey of ecophysiological aspects of diapause development has thus to be limited to inputs and outputs from the blackbox. The terms diapause development, diapause intensity, post-diapause quiescence, horotelic processes of diapause, and tachytelic processes of diapause (reactivation) are defined. Andrewartha's term diapause development has been accepted because it shows diapause as a dynamic event. In about the last 20 years, some views on diapause development have been updated, while others have fossilised. The assumption that chilling is a general prerequisite for completion of diapause development in all insects still survives in part of the scientific community, in spite of much contradictory evidence and often due to inadequate interpretation of experiments (examples given in figures and tables). On the contrary, it has been generally recognised that in temperate climates overwintering diapause is usually already completed in early/mid winter and the dormancy is then temperature quiescence. The conception of multiple pathways of diapause completion postulates that diapause can be completed either by the normal (slow) progress of diapause development (horotelic processes), or by a faster activation (tachytelic processes). There are important differences between the mechanisms regulating activation and the horotelic processes. Thus, e.g., the photoperiodic response is lost during horotelic completion, while after photoperiodic activation it persists. In addition to photoperiodic activation other kinds of activation are being studied, particularly activation by high temperature. Some conclusions can be made from modern studies on diapause development. In every individual, several (at least two) possible pathways exist that are evidently interlinked and mutually complementary. Thus the time of diapause passed at any condition has to be considered, as well as the exposure to very low temperatures. In temperature studies the experimental range ought to be adequately wide and less affected by a priori assumptions. Stimulation by temperature increase or improvement in food or other conditions has to be considered. The success of diapause completion should be measured by at least four parameters: (1) incidence (%) of developmental steps; (2) duration of delay; (3) synchronization; (4) vigour of post-diapause insects (shown by long-term survival or fecundity). The last two parameters have usually been neglected.																	1210-5759						2002	99	2					163	173		10.14411/eje.2002.024								WOS:000177174200006

After artificial overwintering experimental cultures consisting of 150 workers and one queen were established and kept at 16, 18, 20, 22, 24 and 26degreesC under long (22 h) day lengths. The workers reared eggs laid by queens into rapid (non-diapause) brood pupae and diapause larvae, which were removed and counted. The results showed the distinct latitudinal variation in the temperature effects on rapid brood rearing and in the thermal requirements for development. First, the period during which new rapid brood pupae appeared was found to be longer and the total number of pupae produced to be greater in ants from more southern populations. The number of diapause larvae reared by ant cultures was also usually greater, in ants from southern sites. Second, low temperatures reduced the period of rapid brood production and the number of pupae reared to a greater degree in ants from northern populations. It means that northern Myrmica colonies rear rapid brood under lower temperatures evidently worse in comparison with ants from southern regions. Third, eggs and larvae from more northern sites appeared to develop faster than southern brood at temperatures above 16-18degreesC. This was because brood development in northern populations was more temperature dependent, i.e. characterised by higher slopes of regression lines of development rate on temperature. The sum of effective temperatures decreased with the advance to North. The higher slopes were always associated with higher thermal thresholds for development. We conclude that the reaction norm of Myrmica colonies, in response to temperature, changes according to the local climate in such a way that brood rearing, growth and development of individuals become more temperature dependent in more severe environments with colder and shorter summers. This lead to the increase of the physiological and developmental responses at higher temperatures at the expense of a decrease within lower temperature range. In fact Myrmica colonies from northern populations need on average higher temperatures in their nests for successful production of new adults as compared to southern ants.

J	Scriber, JM				Scriber, JM			Latitudinal and local geographic mosaics in host plant preferences as shaped by thermal units and voltinism in Papilio spp. (Lepidoptera)	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY					4th European Workshop on Invertebrate Ecophysiology	SEP 09-14, 2001	ST PETERSBURG STATE UNIV, ST PETERSBURG, RUSSIA		ST PETERSBURG STATE UNIV			Laboratory and field tests support the "voltinism-suitability hypothesis" of host selection at various latitudes as well as in local "cold pockets": The best hosts for rapid development will be selected by herbivorous insects under severe thermal constraints for completion of the generation before winter. Papilio canadensis and P. glaucus females do select the best hosts for rapid larval growth in Alaska and in southern Michigan, but not in northern Michigan and southern Ohio. In addition to latitudinal patterns, local host preferences of P. canadensis are described in relation to "phenological twisting" of leaf suitability for larval growth in cold pockets with "thermally constrained" growing season lengths. White ash leaves (Fraxinus americana) have the highest nutritional quality (relative to cherry, aspen, birch, and other local trees) throughout June and July for P. canadensis populations inside the cold pocket, but not outside. In all areas outside the cold pockets, even with bud-break occurring much later than other tree species, ash leaves rapidly decline in quality after mid-June and become one of the worse tree host species for larvae. This temperature-driven phenology difference creates a geographic mosaic in host plant suitability for herbivores. However, we also report here that the cold pocket of northern Michigan has basically disappeared since 1998. Implications of these changes are discussed in relation to voltinism and host plant selection. Various physiological and ecological adaptations to thermal unit constraints are evident with both species of naturally hybridizing butterflies (P. canadensis to the North and P. glaucus to the South). The rapid regional climate warming since 1998 in the Great Lakes region has allowed us to document some critical aspects of gene flow via analysis of independent "species-diagnostic" trait clines (including morphological, biochemical, and physiological characters). Narrower black bands on hind-wings, larger fore-wings, larval detoxification abilities for tulip tree leaves, behavioral preference of tulip tree leaves, and species-diagnostic allozymes such as PDG (x-linked) and HK (autosomal) provide evidence of these genodynamics. Laboratory hybridization studies (providing known reference groups) and field observations along the hybrid zone show that gene flow between P. glaucus and P. canadensis has recently been extensive across the historical hybrid zone.																	1210-5759						2002	99	2					225	239		10.14411/eje.2002.032								WOS:000177174200014						
J	Braby, MF				Braby, MF			Life history strategies and habitat templets of tropical butterflies in north-eastern Australia	EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY												Three multivoltine species of satyrine butterflies in the genus Mycalesis (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) are narrowly sympatric in the wet-dry tropics of north-eastern Australia. They show a range of ecological strategies and adaptations associated with contrasting habitats and varying selective pressures. Two abiotic factors, namely favorability (the reciprocal of seasonal adversity) and predictability (broadly the reciprocal of disturbance), were examined as potential environmental selective forces in shaping their life histories. Comparison of several key life history traits of the 'wet-season form' revealed that the life histories of each species corresponded well with their habitat characteristics. M. perseus, which lives in habitats which are less favorable (i.e. adverse) and more unpredictable (i.e. temporary), shows many traits of an r-type strategy: smaller size, faster development, earlier maturation, higher fecundity, smaller egg size, and rapid population increase. By contrast, M. sirius and M. terminus, which live in more favorable and predictable (i.e. permanent) habitats, have many life history attributes and other characteristics in common which link them closer to K-type strategies. The only discrepancy is lower potential reproductive effort of M. perseus, which may be accounted for in terms of an evolutionary trade-off, such as with dispersal or dormancy. Other correlates associated with the M. perseus life history tactic include higher sex-size dimorphism, greater dispersal ability, better tolerance to adverse conditions, stronger phenotypic variation, greater degree of polyandry, and a more flexible breeding strategy. The life history patterns of these species are discussed in the context of evolutionary life history models, particularly the Southwood-Greenslade habitat templet.																	0269-7653						2002	16	4					399	413		10.1023/A:1020226426031								WOS:000177983000006						
J	Yano, S; Takafuji, A				Yano, S; Takafuji, A			Variation in the life history pattern of Tetranychus urticae (Acari : Tetranychidae) after selection for dispersal	EXPERIMENTAL AND APPLIED ACAROLOGY												The spider mite Tetranychus urticae shows variation in its dispersal capacity (i.e., the leaf quality at which a female decides to disperse). We were able to artificially select mites that had either a high or a low dispersal capacity, indicating that this trait was genetically controlled. We then compared correlated responses to this selection. Mites with a genetically high dispersal capacity ('HD' strains) had a higher diapause incidence and a lower performance compared to mites with a low dispersal capacity ('LD' strains). A possible effect of random genetic drift during the selection was negligible. Our results suggest that differential dispersal capacity is associated with contrasting life history patterns as a result of natural selection.																	0168-8162						2002	27	1-2					1	10		10.1023/A:1021518221031								WOS:000179745900001	12593508

Lower latitude populations, that is, those nearer the equator, show no diapause response to long or short day exposure. Diapause response to short daylengths is found in higher latitude populations, further south, and increases with increasing latitude. Nearly all individuals in the southernmost population, used in this study, enter diapause under short and long day exposure which implies that the onset of diapause in this population is obligatory. Diapause termination in higher latitude populations is induced by increasing photoperiod, further north, but still south of the equator, diapause is terminated by ageing. The differences in diapausing behaviour of the different populations are discussed in relation to their climatic conditions.																	0168-8162						2002	27	3					209	221		10.1023/A:1021694207456								WOS:000179808900004	12593586

Here we attempt to disentangle the impacts of colonization history and gene flow on these organisms by studying the population genetic structure of the rotifer Brachionus plicatilis. The resting egg banks of B. plicatilis in four-teen salt take populations in the Iberian Peninsula were examined using seven microsatellite loci. A remarkably high degree of geographical structuring was found (F(st) = 0.43), with a significant pattern of isolation by distance. Microsatellite loci were in genetic equilibrium, ruling out inbreeding as an important force in population structuring. Comparisons are drawn with previously published phylogeographical data. Surprisingly, introgression of nuclear genes was detected in neighbouring Populations with divergent mtDNA haplotypes. These results stress the long lasting impact of colonization history and the modulating effect of gene flow at local scales in these organisms.

J	Kobayashi, M; Nihel, N; Kurihara, T				Kobayashi, M; Nihel, N; Kurihara, T			Analysis of northern distribution of Aedes albopictus (Diptera : Culicidae) in Japan by geographical information system	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY												Aedes albopictus (Skuse), a mosquito vector of the dengue fever virus, is prevalent in Japan, distributed widely in Honshu Island with its northern limits between latitude 38degrees to 40degreesdegrees north. The factors affecting distribution of the species in the northern part of Japan were studied using the geographical information system (GIS). During 1998-2000, larval surveillance was carried out in 26 urban and rural areas in the Tohoku district, in the northern part of Honshu Island, by collecting larvae from artificial and natural habitats. Climatological analysis, using the GIS, showed that the following conditions accounted for the current distribution of Ae. albopictus: an annual mean temperature higher than 11degreesC and a mean temperature of the coldest month, January, higher than -2degreesC. A period with temperature above 11degreesC in the confirmed area of the mosquito successively continues for more than 186 d per year. The accumulated temperature calculated from a temperature of 11degreesC, which may be close to the developmental zero of Ae. albopictus, was over 1,350 degree-days. The relationship between the beginning of short-daylength, inducing egg diapause, and the monthly mean temperature during September and October necessary for successful larval development in the Tohoku district is also discussed. We also show the relationship between the current distribution of Ae. albopictus and the annual mean temperature in the United States. From these results it is predicted that Ae. albpictus will be established in some cities in northeast United States.																	0022-2585	1938-2928				JAN	2002	39	1					4	11		10.1603/0022-2585-39.1.4								WOS:000178371600002	11931270

In the 14 wk prior to spawning, mean total gonad size increased from 0.30 +/- 0.17 to 34.38 +/- 13.20% of the polyp cross-sectional area. Gonad size was significantly correlated with temperature and light intensity, but was not correlated with photoperiod or rainfall. Spawning occurred in the month prior to the period of heaviest rainfall, when temperatures were at their maximum, A meta-analysis of spawning time and climatic conditions at 19 other geographical locations also showed that spawning occurs in those periods without heavy rainfall in which temperatures are warmest. The data presented here suggest that temperature is not the only environmental variable controlling the annual timing of coral spawning, Rather, the time of coral spawning is controlled by a combination of temperature and rainfall.																	0171-8630						2002	227						241	251		10.3354/meps227241								WOS:000174545200021						
J	Purvis, G; Fadl, A				Purvis, G; Fadl, A			The influence of cropping rotations and soil cultivation practice on the population ecology of carabids (Coleoptera : Carabidae) in arable land	PEDOBIOLOGIA												Use is made of detailed information on the lifecycles and phenology of carabid beetles in arable fields to analyse pitfall catches and seek evidence for the hypothesis that pre-adult instars in the soil are susceptible to soil tillage operations at particular times of the year. Strictly autumn-breeding species were trapped less frequently at the time of adult emergence in early summer when soil cultivation was done for crop establishment in late spring compared with uncultivated or autumn-sown fields. Analysis of data for species with distinct reproductive cohorts in autumn and spring produced evidence that the larval over-wintering cohort, but not the adult hibernating cohort, was similarly affected by soil cultivation. No evidence was found to suggest that cultivation at the time of egg or early larval instars directly influences the survival of populations and it is concluded that probably only cultivation-induced mortality of late larval and pupal instars has a significant population effect. The longer-term survival of most carabids in arable fields probably depends on either flexibility in their time of breeding or, for strictly autumn-breeding species, on a well-developed phase of post-emergence dispersal by adult beetles. It is concluded that soil cultivation directly impacts on the incidence of larval over-wintering populations and limits the range of lifecycles and phenologies that are possible in arable land. Such constraints may explain the phenomenon of long-term population robustness that is often exhibited by carabid populations in arable crops when they are subject to non-target pesticide effects.																	0031-4056						2002	46	5					452	474		10.1078/0031-4056-00152								WOS:000177907600004						
J	Lodge, GM; Whalley, RDB				Lodge, GM; Whalley, RDB			Fate of annual pasture legumes seeds on a two-way thermogradient plate	RANGELAND JOURNAL												Effects of diurnally alternating temperatures (5/5-45/45degreesC) were examined on a two-way thermogradient plate for non-dormant seeds of 14 annual pasture legumes. Seed fates (germination, temperature induced non-viability and temperature induced dormancy) were determined from daily seed counts over a 14-day period on-plate and a further 14 days after removal from the plate. These data clearly demonstrate the existence and extent of seed fates other than germination. Maximum dormancy occurred over a broad range of temperatures for seeds of Trifolium subterraneum L. var. subterraneunt (Katzn. et Morley) Zohary and Heller cv. Woogenellup (40/35-30/25degreesC), Astragalus hamosus L. cv. loman (40/25-30/5degreesC) and Trifolium hirtum All. cv. Hykon (35/30-30/5degreesC). In contrast, maximum dormancy occurred over a narrow temperature range for Medicago truncatula Gaertn. var. truncatula cv. Paraggio (35/30-30/25degreesC), M. aculeata Willd. var. inermis (Aschers.) Heyn (30/25 and 30/20degreesC), and M. minima L. (35/20-35/5degreesC) seeds. Generally, non-viability was highest in all legumes when temperatures were greater than 35/30degreesC and not significantly different from the maximum value (100%) at temperatures greater than 40/30degreesC. At temperatures less than 35/30degreesC non-viability was less than the maximum (P<0.05) for seeds of all legumes, except M. truncatula cvs. Jemalong and Sephi, M. aculeata, and Vicia villosa ssp. dasycarpa (Ten.) Cav. cv. Namoi. Compared with the other subterranean clover cultivars germination levels T. subterraneum var. brachyealycinum (Katzn. et Morley) Zohary and Heller cv..Clare seeds were not significantly different from the maximum value at higher temperatures. In all annual medics, except M. aculeata germination was not significantly different to the maximum at temperatures greater than 25/20&DEG;C, with high germination (P<0.05) occurring at 30/25degreesC in Jemalong and M. scutellata (L.) Mill cv. Sava and at 30/20degreesC in Paraggio, Sephi, M. minima and M. polymorpha L. Maximum germination in loman and Hykon seeds occurred over a broader temperature range (35/20-15/10degreesC and 30/20-15/5degreesC, respectively) than in Namoi (30/15degreesC and 25/20-25/5degreesC). Probable implications of these data for field emergence of non-dormant seeds and soil seed reserves are discussed.

J	Walker, SL; Waddell, WT; Goodrowe, KL				Walker, SL; Waddell, WT; Goodrowe, KL			Reproductive endocrine patterns in captive female and male red wolves (Canis rufus) assessed by fecal and serum hormone analysis	ZOO BIOLOGY												Reproductive steroid profiles in female (n = 13) and male (n = 5) red wolves (Canis rufus) were characterized in fecal samples collected during the breeding season (December-May) and over a 1 year period, respectively. Blood samples from females (n = 12) also were collected during the periovulatory period for luteinizing hormone (LH) and steroid analysis. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of fecal extracts determined that estradiol and estrone constituted the major and minor forms, respectively, of fecal estrogen metabolites. Although native progesterone was present, pregnane metabolites predominated as the major forms of fecal progestins. HPLC analysis of fecal extracts from males revealed no native testosterone, but rather the predominance of more polar androgen metabolites. Based on hormone profiles and/or pup production, females were classified as pregnant (n = 3), ovulatory-nonpregnant (n = 9), or acyciic (n = 3). Longitudinal monitoring of females indicated no pregnancy-specific differences in concentrations of either fecal progestagen or estrogen metabolites compared to ovulatory-nonpregnant individuals; however, baseline progestagen concentrations were consistently elevated in acyclic females. There was good correspondence between serum and fecal steroid concentration during the periovulatory period. A rise in serum estrogens preceded the ovulatory LH surge which was then followed by a significant progesterone rise during the luteal phase. In males, changes in fecal androgen metabolite concentrations coincided with photoperiod fluctuations, increasing in late autumn and reaching peak concentrations during mid- to late winter just before the start of the breeding season. Collectively, these results serve as a database of ovarian and testicular endocrine events in this species, which can be utilized in population management and application of assisted reproductive technologies.

J	Brown, JL; Graham, LH; Wu, JM; Collins, D; Swanson, WF				Brown, JL; Graham, LH; Wu, JM; Collins, D; Swanson, WF			Reproductive endocrine responses to photoperiod and exogenous gonadotropins in the Pallas' cat (Otocolobus manul)	ZOO BIOLOGY												Fecal samples were collected for 14-26 months from three male and six female Pallas' cats (Otocolobus manul) to examine gonadal steroidogenie activity in response to changes in photoperiod and treatment with exogenous gonadotropins. Females exhibited a seasonal anestrus from May-December, excreting consistently low concentrations of fecal estrogens (overall mean. 50.2+/-8.5 ng/g). During the breeding season (January-April), baseline fecal estrogen concentrations were higher, averaging 128.4+/-18.9 ng/g, with peak concentrations ranging from 455.8-909.6 ng/g. Interpeak intervals in estrogen excretion ranged between 7 and 21 days, with an average estrous cycle length of 14.3 +/- 1.7 days. Two females became pregnant after natural mating, with overall luteal progestogen concentrations averaging similar to40 mug/g throughout gestation. Fecal estrogens increased in mid-gestation, peaking just before birth. Induction of follicular development with eCG (100-300 IU, i.m.) resulted in an increase in fecal estrogens (peak range, 263.1-1198.1 ng/g), followed by a postovulatory increase in fecal progestogens (overall mean, 41.1+/-11.9 mug/g) after hCG (75-150 IU, i.m.). Despite apparently normal ovarian responses, none of the females conceived after artificial insemination (AI). The gonadotropin-induced nonpregnant luteal phase lasted 49.8+/-5.3 days (range, 30-60 days), whereas gestation lasted similar to70 days. In the male Pallas' cat, fecal androgens were elevated from November-April (overall mean, 352.3 +/- 30.3 ng/g) compared with nadir concentrations during the rest of the year (82.1 +/- 3.3 ng/g). Entrainment of seasonality to photoperiod was demonstrated by stimulation of gonadal steroidogenic activity in cats exposed to increasing artificial light during natural (nonbreeding season) and artificially induced short-day photoperiods. In summary, reproduction in Pallas' cats is highly seasonal and photoperiod-dependent. Females exhibit elevated baseline and peak fecal estrogen concentrations for 3-4 months during late winter/early spring. Testicular steroidogenic activity precedes the rise in female estrogen excretion by about 2 months, presumably to ensure maximal sperm production during the breeding season.

J	Herman, WS; Tatar, M				Herman, WS; Tatar, M			Juvenile hormone regulation of longevity in the migratory monarch butterfly	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) of eastern North America are well known for their long-range migration to overwintering roosts in south-central Mexico. An essential feature of this migration involves the exceptional longevity of the migrant adults; individuals persist from August/September to March while their summer counterparts are likely to live less than two months as adults. Migrant adults persist during a state of reproductive diapause in which both male and female reproductive development is arrested as a consequence of suppressed synthesis of juvenile hormone. Here, we describe survival in monarch butterflies as a function of the migrant syndrome. We show that migrant adults are longer lived than summer adults when each arc maintained under standard laboratory conditions, that the longevity of migrant adults is curtailed by treatment with juvenile hormone and chat the longevity of summer adults is increased by 100% when juvenile hormone synthesis is prevented by surgical removal of its source, the corpora allatum. Thus, monarch butterfly persistence through a long winter season is ensured in part by reduced ageing that is under endocrine regulation, as well as by the unique environmental properties of their winter roost sites. Phenotypic plasticity for ageing is an integral component of the monarch butterflies' migration-diapause syndrome.																	0962-8452					DEC 22	2001	268	1485					2509	2514		10.1098/rspb.2001.1765								WOS:000173473400002	11749703

Ptilothrix plumata (Hymenoptera) is a neotropical solitary bee that nests in bare, sandy soils. Data on the biology and behaviour of this species are provided. Egg-to-adult development time of a neotropical solitary bee and its parasitoids is quantified for the first time. 2. The bee showed huge variability in egg-to-adult development time. There are two categories of eggs relative to adult emergence. The sam season eggs are those from which adults emerge in the same reproductive season in which the ego's were laid. Adults from next season eggs emerge in the next dry reproductive season. This variability in egg-to-adult development time is reached through prepupal diapause. The bee larval parasitoids Leucospis genalis (Hymenoptera) and Anthrax sp. (Diptera) showed similar range in their development times. The data show that diapause is controlled by season. 3. By synchronising adult emergence, this variability in egg-to-adult development time facilitates mate finding, and population recruitment is a consequence of the bees avoiding the unfavourable reproductive season.

In addition to threatening the biodiversity of these native ecosystems, such non-target effects would generate negative publicity that could heighten public concern over the use of exotic natural enemies and jeopardize future biological control programs against weeds. In this paper we discuss the use of inherited (F-1) sterility in Lepidoptera to study, predict, and manage the expanding populations of C. cactorum, Research areas in which the use of F-1 sterility would be most applicable include (1) elucidation of the host range of C, cactorum for key native Opuntia species from across the US., (2) prediction of the geographic range of C. cactorum in the U.S. and Mexico, and (3) delineation of the impact of native natural enemies on the spread of C. cactorum. The use of F-1 sterility for control of C. cactorum would be most appropriate fur (1) eradication of C. cactorum from areas of new introductions, or from isolated and/or environmentally sensitive areas such as the Florida Keys, (2) establishment of a barrier by means of release of irradiated moths along the leading edge of the C. cactorum geographical range, and (3) provisioning sterile C. cactorum in the field as hosts for released natural enemies to increase their initial survival and establishment.																	0015-4040					DEC	2001	84	4					531	536		10.2307/3496384								WOS:000173025300012

Snakes were captured by hand and by drift fence traps throughout their active season. We made 1071 field observations of snakes, of which 493 (235 males, 258 females) were individually identified and 578 were observed but their identity was not determined. Estimated median maximum period of activity was 206 days (1 April to 21 October). Mean date of first emergence was not significantly different for males and females, and there was no significant difference in mean spring emergence date among adult, immature, and newborn snakes. Hand captures of mature males occurred mostly in spring and fall. This pattern differed significantly from that of mature females, who had three peaks of captures: spring, summer, and fail. Captures of snakes in drift fence traps generally began a month later than the first hand captures in spring, but the last captures iii fall occurred approximately at the same time for both methods. Most captures of mature males in drift fence traps occurred in summer. We suggest that the hibernaculum was located within the summer feeding range of this population of C. v. oreganus. In addition, we found a longer active season than might be expected based on latitude and altitude of the hibernaculum.																	0022-1511					DEC	2001	35	4					583	589		10.2307/1565895								WOS:000172770100005

Soil samples infested with H. glycines were collected in August or October in 1992 to 1994 from soybean fields in two to four states (combinations of Arkansas, Florida, Minnesota, Missouri, and Wisconsin). The samples were mixed thoroughly, divided into subsamples, shipped to an overwinter location, and buried until time for processing. To determine survival, cysts, eggs, and second-stage juveniles were extracted from replicated subsamples and counted each month from December to May. Survival generally was between 50% and 100%, and often was best in the state of origin. In Florida, survival was at the 50 to 100% level in soil from most locations, and in Wisconsin was near 100%. Survival of H. glycines in Arkansas and Missouri varied more than at the other locations. In a separate test, survival in microplots in Arkansas, in a more natural environment than that of buried samples, was 70 to 94% for field isolates from Arkansas. Minnesota, and Missouri and 100% for isolates of races 1, 3, and 14 that had been maintained in a greenhouse for several years. Survival appears to be better than previous tests had indicated. High survival rates require cultivars with high levels of resistance and long-term rotations for management.																	0022-300X					DEC	2001	33	4					219	226										WOS:000180648100012	19265885					
J	Kostal, V; Havelka, J; Simek, P				Kostal, V; Havelka, J; Simek, P			Low-temperature storage and cold hardiness in two populations of the predatory midge Aphidoletes aphidimyza, differing in diapause intensity	PHYSIOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												The potential for medium-time, low-temperature storage was compared in diapausing larvae of two populations of Aphidoletes aphidimyza, a predatory midge used to control aphids in greenhouses. During 4 months of storage, no statistical decrease of survival rate. (c. 75%) was observed in the population Palamos (field collected). However, a significant decrease (below 50%) was recorded in the population Biobest (commercial, selected for the best performance in greenhouses). Measuring physiological parameters related to the rate of diapause development revealed that the larvae of the population Palamos (in contrast to Biobest) showed a significant metabolic suppression even at the relatively high temperature of 17 degreesC, a slower rate of glycogen depletion during storage at 3 degreesC and a longer duration of diapause development (a higher intensity of diapause, collectively). A higher capacity for survival at subzero temperatures (cold hardiness), in either the supercooled or frozen state, was also found in the Palamos population. It is suggested that the higher survival at low-temperature storage might be linked directly to the higher diapause intensity. It remains unclear, however, whether and how the performance during low-temperature storage is linked to the capacity for cold hardiness.

J	Filchak, KE; Roethele, JB; Feder, JL				Filchak, KE; Roethele, JB; Feder, JL			Effects of photoperiod and light intensity on the genetics of diapause in the apple maggot (Diptera : Tephritidae)	ANNALS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												Rhagoletis pomonella (Walsh) is all important pest of apples and has been at the center of a long-standing debate concerning modes of speciation. The fly has been proposed to speciate without geographic isolation (i.e., in sympatry) in the process of shifting and adapting to new host plants. Previous studies have shown that diapause-related traits play a key role in adapting apple- and hawthorn-infesting races of R. pomonella to a difference in the fruiting times (phenologies) of their respective host plants. These experiments indicated that prewinter temperature and its duration affected the survivorship and genetics of over-wintering R. pomonella pupae. However, the earlier work did not test whether photoperiod and light intensity. two environmental factors that also differ between the host races. affect the genetics of diapause. Here, we report that variation in photoperiod, but not light intensity, during the larval stage affects adult eclosion. Haw-origin larvae exposed to longer photoperiods ( 18:6 /L:D/ h) eclosed significantly earlier that those experiencing shorter photoperiods (14:10 and 10:14 /L:D/ h). We also confirmed previously observed genetic relationships between eclosion time and six allozyme loci displaying allele frequency differences between the haw and apple host races, However. we did not find a significant genetic response to photoperiod for any allozyme. Out, results Suggest that, while photoperiod cites can regulate R. pomonella diapause, daylength is probably of secondary importance relative to temperature and season length in genetically differentiating the host races.																	0013-8746					NOV	2001	94	6					902	908		10.1603/0013-8746(2001)094[0902:EOPALI]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000172451400011						
J	Jallow, MFA; Matsumura, M				Jallow, MFA; Matsumura, M			Influence of temperature on the rate of development of Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) (Lepidoptera : Noctuidae)	APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY												We investigated the effects of a range of constant temperatures (13.3-32.5 degreesC) on the development of all stages of Helicoverpa armigera (Kumamoto population) reared on tomato. The duration of the different life history stages decreased as temperature increased from 13.3 degreesC to 32.5 degreesC. A developmental threshold of 10.5 degreesC, 11.3 degreesC and 13.8 degreesC was estimated for the eggs, larvae and pupal stages, respectively. A thermal constant of 51 degree-days above a threshold of 10.5 degreesC was required for the development of the eggs. The larval stage required 215.1 degree-days and the pupal stage 151.8 degree-days above 11.3 degreesC and 13.8 degreesC developmental thresholds, respectively. Results from these studies may provide information important for predicting the field population phenology of H. armigera in Kumamoto Prefecture.																	0003-6862					NOV	2001	36	4					427	430										WOS:000172477000004						
J	Schippers, P; van Groenendael, JM; Vleeshouwers, LM; Hunt, R				Schippers, P; van Groenendael, JM; Vleeshouwers, LM; Hunt, R			Herbaceous plant strategies in disturbed habitats	OIKOS												A systematic theoretical evaluation has been made of three important plant life history traits: adult longevity, seed longevity and seed mass, where seed mass is interpreted as being indicative of dispersal distance and seedling vigour. This model study examined the role of these three traits in relation to environmental disturbance. We chose temperate grasslands, widespread in north Western Europe and northern and eastern America, as our reference system for our simulations. Eight plant strategies were defined by allowing two levels in each of the three and combining them in all eight possible ways. A simple, spatially explicit model was developed to simulate competition among individuals with these eight trait combinations at different levels of disturbance. Simulation results were compared with the actual occurrence over a disturbance gradient of species with similar plant trait combinations in a large database from the Sheffield area (UK). This showed that with increasing disturbance level, non-dormant perennials, dormant perennials, non-dormant annuals and dormant annuals, respectively, became dominant but only if small-seeded, indicating the relative viability of these particular strategies with respect to disturbance. A new prediction from the model was that stable coexistence occurs between plant strategies with dormant and with non-dormant seeds over a range of levels of disturbance. Plant strategies with large seeds were inferior to small-seeded ones if competitive ability of seedlings is proportional to seed weight. This difference was highest at low seed densities and low germination probabilities, indicating that large-seeded species secure no advantage from being dormant (i.e. having a low germination probability). Finally, the results indicated that dormancy is superior to dispersal as a method of coping with disturbance.

J	Daibo, S; Kimura, MT; Goto, SG				Daibo, S; Kimura, MT; Goto, SG			Upregulation of genes belonging to the drosomycin family in diapausing adults of Drosophila triauraria	GENE												Diapause-associated gene expression was studied in Drosophila triauraria using subtractive hybridization. Two genes that were shown to be upregulated in diapausing flies by Northern hybridization have similarity to genes encoding antifungal peptides of Drosophila melanogaster, members of the drosomycin family (drosomycin, CG10812, CG10813, CG10815 and CG11520). In addition, a signal peptide and Knot 1 domain are shared with them. The genes cloned from D. triauraria are tentatively named drosomycin-like. However, the similarities between drosomycin-like in D. triauraria and the members of the drosomycin family in D. melanogaster are quite lower than those between other homologous genes in these species. In addition, neighbor-joining analysis revealed that drosomycin-like in D. triauraria is not closely related to known members of the family in D. melanogaster. Thus, it is most plausible that drosomycin-like is not a D. triauraria counterpart of known members of the family, but a novel member belonging to the family. The drosomycin-like gene is expected to have a few copies, because at least two sequences having unique 3'-ends were obtained in RACE, and multiple bands were observed in Southern hybridization. However, these sequences from RACE had the same ORF. Probes for genes encoding additional antimicrobial peptides were used to evaluate expression during diapause. Like drosomycin-like, drosomycin was upregulated during diapause, but defensin and drosocin were not. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

Collections of S. terebinthifolius drupes in Florida during a 2-year period indicated that M. transvaalensis was present at all IS sites surveyed and this was the only insect that emerged from these drupes. Dissections of drupes collected during the winter fruiting period indicated that wasps damaged 23.5 +/- 2.8% of the drupes during 1997-1998 and 38.5 +/- 4.2% of the drupes during 1998-1999. During the spring fruit production period, 76.3 +/- 3.6% of the drupes were damaged by the wasp in 1998 and 74.8 +/- 3.4% during the same period of 1999. Germination tests of wasp-damaged drupes indicated that none of the infested seeds were viable. Purportedly diapausing wasps emerged more rapidly from rearing conditions that included a 12-h compared to a 14-h photoperiod. Utilization of alternate hosts was not detected despite attempts to rear the wasp from drupes of the native species within and outside the Anacardiaceae family found in the Florida range of S. terebinthifolius.																	1049-9644					OCT	2001	22	2					139	148		10.1006/bcon.2001.0968								WOS:000171408000005						
J	Hajek, AE; Wheeler, MM; Eastburn, CC; Bauer, LS				Hajek, AE; Wheeler, MM; Eastburn, CC; Bauer, LS			Storage of resting spores of the gypsy moth fungal pathogen, Entomophaga maimaiga	BIOCONTROL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The fungal pathogen, Entomophaga maimaiga causes epizootics in populations of the important North American forest defoliator gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar). Increasing use of this fungus for biological control is dependent on our ability to produce and manipulate the long-lived overwintering resting spores (azygospores). E. maimaiga resting spores undergo obligate dormancy before germination so we investigated conditions required for survival during dormancy as well as the dynamics of subsequent germination. After formation in the Weld during summer, resting spores were stored under various moisture levels, temperatures, and with and without soil in the laboratory and Weld. The following spring, for samples maintained in the Weld, germination was greatest among resting spores stored in plastic bags containing either moistened paper towels or sterile soil. Resting spores did not require light during storage to subsequently germinate. In the laboratory, only resting spores maintained with either sterile or unsterilized soil at 4 degreesC (but not at 20 or -20 degreesC) germinated the following spring, but at a much lower percentage than most Weld treatments. To further investigate the effects of relative humidity (RH) during storage, field-collected resting spores were placed at a range of humidities at 4 degreesC. After 9.5 months, resting spore germination was highest at 58% RH and no resting spores stored at 88 or 100% RH germinated. To evaluate the dynamics of infections initiated by resting spores after storage, gypsy moth larvae were exposed to soil containing resting spores that had been collected in the Weld and stored at 4 degreesC for varying lengths of time. No differences in infection occurred among larvae exposed to fall-collected soil samples stored at 4 degreesC over the winter, versus soil samples collected from the same location the following spring. Spring-collected resting spores stored at 4 degreesC did not go into secondary dormancy. At the time that cold storage of soil containing resting spores began in spring, infection among exposed larvae was initiated within a few days after bringing the soil to 15 degreesC. This same pattern was also found for spring-collected resting spore-bearing soil that was assayed after cold storage for 2-7 months. However, after 31-32 months in cold storage, infections started 14-18 days after soil was brought to 15 degreesC, indicating a delay in resting spore activity after prolonged cold storage.																	0958-3157					SEP	2001	11	5					637	647		10.1080/09583150120076184								WOS:000171038500007

PHYSIOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												Yellow dung fly (Scathophaga stercoraria (L.)) populations on cow pastures in Central Europe usually show a characteristic summer decline in fly numbers. This has been related to their sensitivity to hot temperatures, but where and in what state the flies spend the summer has remained unclear. Field enclosure experiments revealed no evidence for survival over summer in the pupal stage, as adults never emerged in early autumn from eggs laid in late spring. Laboratory and field evidence shows instead that adults acclimatize physiologically by suppressing reproduction in favour of accumulating lipid (but not glycogen) reserves. Apparently they spend the summer in cooler, forested areas close to the pastures. As reproduction is not entirely shut down, it is suggested that this represents quiescence rather than diapause. Presumably this increases the survival of the flies during the hottest time of the season, and appears to be a flexible life-history strategy, particularly for late-born spring generation individuals.																	0307-6962	1365-3032				SEP	2001	26	3					260	265		10.1046/j.0307-6962.2001.00245.x								WOS:000171284500011						
J	Butterfield, J; Whittaker, JB; Fielding, CA				Butterfield, J; Whittaker, JB; Fielding, CA			Control of the flexible annual/biennial life cycle of the heather psyllid Strophingia ericae	PHYSIOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												Strophingia ericae (Curtis) (Homoptera: Psylloidea) takes one or two years to complete its life cycle. In both cases eggs hatch over a prolonged period from midsummer, possibly extending into the following spring at high altitude, and instars overlap in time. Instar III is the predominant overwintering stage in the lowland, annual cycle, whereas in the upland, biennial cycle most first-year nymphs overwinter in instars I and Il and most second-year nymphs in instar V. When moved to the laboratory, instars IV and V from a predominantly annual population showed accelerated development in response to elevated temperatures and to long days in both mid-winter and early spring. In the biennial life cycle, short autumn days retard instar V development but the response to photoperiod disappears by the end of winter. Exposure to LD 18 : 6 h retarded development of early instars in the annual population, resulting in an accumulation in instar III. The proportion of overwintering, instars I and II rises with increase in altitude and moult to instar III becomes progressively delayed. Nymphs that reach instar III under long daylengths in the year following hatching are channelled towards the biennial cycle. Exposure of a predominantly biennial population to 15 degreesC and LD 18 : 6 h after midsummer, thus avoiding autumn conditions, promoted the rapid development of overwintered nymphs, switching the cycle from biennial to annual.																	0307-6962					SEP	2001	26	3					266	274		10.1046/j.0307-6962.2001.00246.x								WOS:000171284500012

Each female laid a mean of 4.7 +/- 0.4 times (range 1 - 9). The mean number of eggs per oviposition and female was 129.2 +/- 2.4 and 587.4 +/- 92.1 respectively. and the time between egg-layings averaged 16.3 +/- 0.8 days.																	0034-7744					SEP-DEC	2001	49	3-4					1067	1071										WOS:000176106300026	12189788					
J	Wapstra, E; Swain, R; O'Reilly, JM				Wapstra, E; Swain, R; O'Reilly, JM			Geographic variation in age and size at maturity in a small Australian viviparous skink	COPEIA												Age and size at maturity are pivotal life-history traits through their effects on other key traits, such as annual and lifetime fecundity. We used skeletochronology to investigate the relationships among size (snout-vent length), age, and maturity in two populations of a small viviparous skink, Niveoscincus ocellatus, from Tasmania, Australia. The species occupies a wide geographic and climatic range within the temperate zone, and we chose populations from the climatic extremes of this range. Growth in N. ocellatus is rapid early in life but slows considerably after maturity in both sexes. Within sites, we found no difference in growth patterns or length at maturity between the sexes. However, there were large differences between sites. At our "warm" site, lizards were mature at three years of age at a relatively small size. Lizards from the "cold" site typically delayed maturity until their fourth year (although some males were mature at the end of their third year); as a result, they were significantly larger at maturity and thereafter remained larger for any age than did warm-site lizards. These patterns are consistent with predictions from models of the proximate influence of the thermal environment on growth and maturity patterns in squamate reptiles. Lizards from the cold site are born later in the season and have a shorter activity season prior to obligatory winter hibernation, and conditions for growth are less favorable in any particular month than at the warm site. Because delaying maturity is costly to current fecundity, we suggest that in N. ocellatus lifetime fecundity is enhanced at the cold site by additional growth and gains in future fecundity through the relationship between body length and reproductive output.

In bugs from the Kyoto population (35 degrees 00' N, 135 degrees 45' E), we studied (1) the effects of day-length on the nymphal and preoviposition periods under constant photoperiod at 20.5 degreesC, and (2) photoperiodic induction of adult diapause at 20.5 degreesC and under a combination of constant photoperiod and natural daily rhythm of temperature in the forest-steppe zone of Russia (50 degrees 38' N, 35 degrees 58' E). Then, we examined (3) the timing of diapause induction under quasi-natural conditions in the same region, far outside the species' natural geographical range. At 20.5 degreesC, the nymphal period in both males and females was significantly longer under regimes with shorter photophases than under those with longer photophases. The preoviposition period in females was significantly longer under the near-critical long-day regime L14:D10 than under typical long-day regimes (L15:D9, L16:D8, and L17:D7). The critical day-length for diapause induction was shorter under conditions of natural daily rhythm of temperature than those reported at constant 20, 25, and 30 degreesC. Under quasi-natural conditions in the forest-steppe zone, R. clavatus entered diapause in September, much later than the local populations of true bugs studied to date. This experiment showed that R. clavatus was maladapted to new environmental conditions: diapause was induced too late with the result that all or most nymphs hatched in late August or early September will die.

Developmental rate and lower development threshold were described by a linear function and compared among wasp colonies. The temperature thresholds for development from egg to adult for the Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Texas wasp colonies were estimated to be 5.64,6.61, and 6.42 degreesC, respectively; corresponding degree-day requirements for development were 181.2, 169.5, and 188.0 DD, respectively. No differences in developmental rate or lower development threshold estimates were observed among the wasp colonies. However, adult survival at 10 degreesC was greater in the Nebraska colony, suggesting that there may be variation in the ability of L. testaceipes populations to tolerate and survive cold temperatures.

J	Zhou, HZ				Zhou, HZ			Reproduction of Lagria hirta (Coleoptera : Lagriidae) and its life-history trait correlation	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												Life-history traits correlated to reproduction are important in deciding adaptability of insects. Lagria hirta L. has a short phytophagous adult phase in summer and a very long saprophagous larval phase extending from autumn until spring. This study revealed that its reproduction was modified by external factors and by complex interactions involving different life-history traits. Oviposition occurred only at 15-25 degreesC, LD (L16: D8) or SD (L8: D16). Within this temperature range, preoviposition time, fecundity and adult life span were affected (P less than or equal to 0.05). Photoperiod Was found significantly, to affect fecundity, viability of eggs and preoviposition time (P less than or equal to 0.04). Unmated females can lay eggs, but the eggs are sterile. The survival of eggs is also influenced by photoperiod (P < 0.001). In this study, the subtle variations were examined in the last instar's duration, pupal weight, fecundity and adult life span. In terms of reproduction, two correlations were apparent: larval short last instar durations result in heavier pupae and eclose to longer-lived adults; conversely, larvae with longer last instars produce lighter pupae which, if female, tend to lay fewer eggs. These correlations were statistically significant (P less than or equal to 0.05). These trends represent a trade-off in resource allocation: long final instar duration may consume more energy that would be invested in reproduction. This is heterogeneous (phenotypically or genotypically) among the individuals of L. hirta.																	0046-225X					AUG	2001	30	4					686	691		10.1603/0046-225X-30.4.686								WOS:000170602100009						
J	Salo, O; Rosengren, R				Salo, O; Rosengren, R			Memory of location and site recognition in the ant Formica uralensis (Hymenoptera : Formicidae)	ETHOLOGY												Spatial recognition cues used in site fidelity in the ant Formica uralensis Ruzsky were studied using outdoor and laboratory arenas. Ant workers visiting symmetrically spaced feeders were colour-marked corresponding to the initial feeder visited during sampling. The effect of manipulating environmental cues on the mean 'spatial specialization' of the population was measured. Site recognition appears to be based on visual landmark/canopy cues. However, ants maintained some fidelity when shielded from these cues, suggesting the involvement of additional cues. When ridding our experimental device of olfactory deposits and shielding Visual cues, site fidelity was lost. Idiothetic and/or geomagnetic cues are thought to provide spatial references to visual or olfactory landmarks. Altering nest position relative to the arena and changing the geomagnetic field within the arena in our study, however, did nothing to the site fidelity of visually deprived and non-deprived foragers. We conclude that site fidelity is developed in a visually structured environment but supplemented by an olfactory backup system that is probably based on discrete home range markings rather than radial odour trails. We demonstrate furthermore that the visual component involved in site location can be stored in the memory of individual F. uralensis foragers during a 6-month hibernation period.																	0179-1613					AUG	2001	107	8					737	752		10.1046/j.1439-0310.2001.00702.x								WOS:000171351400007

ABA and various abiotic stresses also activate the expression of numerous plant genes through undefined signaling pathways. To gain insight into ABA and stress signal transduction, we conducted a genetic screen based on ABA- and stress -inducible gene transcription. Here we report the identification of an Arabidopsis mutation, fiery1 (fry1), which results in super-induction of ABA- and stress-responsive genes. Seed germination and postembryonic development of fry1 are more sensitive to ABA or stress inhibition. The mutant plants are also compromised in tolerance to freezing, drought, and salt stresses. Map-based cloning revealed that FRY1 encodes an inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatase, which functions in the catabolism of inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate (IP3). Upon ABA treatment, fry1 mutant plants accumulated more IP3 than did the wild-type plants. These results provide the first genetic evidence indicating that phosphoinositols mediate ABA and stress signal transduction in plants and their turnover is critical for attenuating ABA and stress signaling.

J	Beaty, RM; Taylor, AH				Beaty, RM; Taylor, AH			Spatial and temporal variation of fire regimes in a mixed conifer forest landscape, Southern Cascades, California, USA	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim In this study, we evaluated the fire-forest mosaic of a mixed conifer forest landscape by testing the hypothesis that pre-fire suppression fire regime parameters vary with species composition (tree species), and environment (i.e. slope aspect, slope position, elevation). Location Our study was conducted in the 1587 ha Cub Creek Research Natural Area (CCRNA), Lassen National Forest, CA, USA. Methods We quantified the return interval, seasonal occurrence, size, rotation period, and severity of fires using dendroecology. Results Slope aspect, potential soil moisture, forest composition, and fire regime parameters in our study area co-vary. Median composite and point fire return intervals (FRI) were longest on higher, cooler, more mesic, north-facing (NF) slopes covered with white fir (Abies concolor), Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii)-white fir, and red fir (A. magnifica)-white fir forests, shortest on the dry, south-facing (SF) slopes covered with ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa)-white fir forests and intermediate on west-facing slopes dominated by white fir-sugar pine (P. lambertiana)-incense cedar (Libocedrus decurrens) forests. The spatial pattern for length of fire rotation (FR) was the same as that for FRI. Fires in CCRNA mixed conifer forests occurred mainly (90%) in the dormant season. Size of burns in CCRNA mixed conifer forests were generally small (mean = 106 ha), however, during certain drought years widespread fires burned across fuel breaks and spread throughout the watershed. Fire severity was mainly high on upper slopes, low on lower slopes and moderate and low severity on middle slopes. Patterns of fire severity also varied with slope aspect. Fire frequency decreased dramatically in CCRNA after 1905. Conclusions In CCRNA, fire regime parameters [e.g. FRI, fire extent, FR, fire severity] varied widely with species composition, slope aspect and slope position. There was also temporal variation in fire extent with the most widespread fires occurring during drought years. The important contributions of topography and climate to variation in the fire regime indicates that exogenous factors play a key role in shaping the fire-forest structure mosaic and that the fire-forest structure mosaic is more variable, less predictable and less stable than previously thought. Finally, some characteristics of the fire regime (i.e. fire severity, season of burn) in CCRNA are different than those described for other mixed conifer forests and this suggests that there are geographical differences in mixed conifer fire regimes along the Pacific slope.

J	Clarke, PJ; Kerrigan, RA; Westphal, CJ				Clarke, PJ; Kerrigan, RA; Westphal, CJ			Dispersal potential and early growth in 14 tropical mangroves: do early life history traits correlate with patterns of adult distribution?	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 We characterized the dispersal potential and early growth traits of 14 tropical mangrove species in experiments where diaspores were immersed in various solutions of seawater and subsequently stranded onto surfaces with the same salinity. 2 Viviparous and non-viviparous species had similar buoyancy, seed weight and rates of root and shoot initiation, as well as early growth and salinity tolerance. This trait convergence may be related to selection against small, dormant diaspores in the unstable regeneration niche. 3 Differences in dispersal potential and early growth of 12 species were compared with known patterns of distribution (across the shore, along estuaries, regional occurrence and continental range size) to test if tidal sorting of diaspores could account for adult spatial patterns. 4 Diaspore buoyancy, orientation, lateral root initiation, shoot initiation and early shoot extension differed among species but none correlated with adult zonation across the shore or along estuaries. However, some back-shore species had diaspores that were buoyant and were slow to initiate lateral roots and shoots. Patterns of early growth were partially related to the distribution along estuaries but salinity responses contributed to this zonation in only three species. 5 Regional distributions were unrelated to dispersal potential. However, the tendency of infrequent species to show slow growth in full seawater may account for the under-saturation of species in estuaries with appropriate habitats. The range size of the tropical mangroves appears unrelated to their dispersal potential and early growth traits. 6 Early life history traits of 12 mangroves showed poor correlation with patterns of adult distribution across all spatial scales. Traits related to establishment were., however, stronger predictors of distribution than those associated with dispersal.

J	Tasma, IM; Lorenzen, LL; Green, DE; Shoemaker, RC				Tasma, IM; Lorenzen, LL; Green, DE; Shoemaker, RC			Mapping genetic loci for flowering time, maturity, and photoperiod insensitivity in soybean	MOLECULAR BREEDING												Time of flowering and maturity in soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr) are important reproductive characters of agronomic interest. These traits are useful for developing soybean cultivars with a wider geographical adaptation. The objective of this research was to use molecular markers to identify chromosomal regions that control traits for flowering time, maturity and photoperiod insensitivity in soybean. Two single-cross populations, IX132 (PI 317.336 x `Corsoy') consisting of 101 progeny, and IX136 (PI 317.334B x `Corsoy') consisting of 100 progeny, were used. Days to R1 (the day when 50% of the plants in a plot have an open flower at one of the top nodes with a fully expanded leaf) was observed among F-6:7 RI lines in the field during 1991 and 1992 and in the growth chamber at 12 h and 20 h photoperiods using fluorescent and incandescent lamps. Days to R3 (the number of days after emergence when 50% of the plants in a plot had presented the first 5 mm pod at one of the top four nodes with a fully expanded leaf was observed in the field during 1991 and in the growth chamber with 12 h photoperiod. Days to R7 (the number of days after emergence when 50% of pods in a plot had mature pod color) was observed in the field in 1991. A total of 139 markers (88 RFLPs and 51 SSRs) in the IX132 population and 125 markers (73 RFLPs and 52 SSRs) in the IX136 population were used to map quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting these traits. Results show that a large-effect QTL for days to R1, R3, and R7, and photoperiod insensitivity was found at the same location on linkage group (LG) C2 in both populations. This result suggests that photoperiod insensitivity, flowering time, and maturity may be controlled by the same gene(s) or by tightly clustered genes in the same chromosomal region. In addition to the large effect QTL, minor QTL were also detected controlling the four traits in both populations. Minor QTL account for as much as 17.8% and 12.1% of phenotypic variance in populations IX132 and IX136, respectively. Thus, time of flowering, maturity, and photoperiod insensitivity in these soybean populations are proposed to be controlled by a major QTL with a large effect and modified by several minor QTL.																	1380-3743					AUG	2001	8	1					25	35		10.1023/A:1011998116037								WOS:000171296900003						
J	Charrier, M; Rouland, C				Charrier, M; Rouland, C			Mannan-degrading enzymes purified from the crop of the brown garden snail Helix aspersa Muller (Gastropoda pulmonata)	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL ZOOLOGY												Two mannan-degrading enzymes were purified from the crop of the terrestrial snail Helix aspersa Muller. The crude extracts were taken from dormant (for 4 months) snails. The enzymes were a betaD-mannanase of 37.4 +/- 0.3 kDa (EC 3.2.1.78) and a betaD-mannosidase of 77.8 +/- 1.9 kDa (EC 3.2.1.25). Both enzymes degraded insoluble mannan, releasing either mannose only (beta -mannosidase) or oligosaccharides, possibly mannotriose and mannopentaose (beta -mannanase). The beta -mannanase had a typical endo-activity pattern, while the beta -mannosidase was an exoenzyme. The incubation of both enzymes with mannan increased the catalysis by 83%. The best synergy was found with 75% mannosidase combined with 25% mannanase. The beta -mannanase also hydrolysed beta -linked heteromannans and its affinity for different galactomannans was studied. The Km values, varying from 2.89 +/- 0.47 mg x ml(-1) to 0.26 +/- 0.01 mg x ml(-1), revealed the inhibitory effect of the alphaD-galactosyl residues released. The beta -mannosidase was acidic (optimum pH = 3.3) and heat-sensitive (50% residual activity at 4.2 degreesC: after 5 min of pre-incubation), while the beta -mannanase remained stable until 48.5 degreesC (50% residual activity) and over a pH range of 4.3-7.5. The properties of these mannanolytic enzymes are discussed in this paper compared with those purified in other gastropods and in a bacterium, Enterococcus casseliflavus, a quite similar strain previously isolated from this snail intestine. The occurrence of thermostable enzymes in H aspersa digestive tract could be a zootechnic parameter of great importance for snail farming.

J	Broufas, GD; Koveos, DS				Broufas, GD; Koveos, DS			Rapid cold hardening in the predatory mite Euseius (Amblyseius) finlandicus (Acari : Phytoseiidae)	JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY												A rapid cold hardening response was studied in diapause and non-diapause females of the predatory mite Euseius finlandicus. When laboratory reared diapause and non-diapause females were transferred and maintained from the rearing temperature of 20 degreesC for 2 h to -11.5 degreesC and -10 degreesC, 10 to 20% survived respectively. However, conditioning of diapause females for 4 h at a range of temperatures from 0 to 10 degreesC before their exposure for 2 h to -11.5 degreesC, increased survival to approximately 90%. Similarly, conditioning of non-diapause females for 4 h at 5 degreesC before their exposure for 2 h to -10 degreesC increased survival to 90%. A similar rapid cold hardening response in both diapause and non-diapause females was also induced through gradual cooling of the mites, at a rate of approximately 0.4 degreesC per min. The rapid increase in cold tolerance after prior conditioning of the mites to low temperatures, was rapidly lost when they returned to a higher temperature of 20 degreesC. Rapid cold hardening extended the survival time of diapause and non-diapause females at sub-zero temperatures. The cost of rapid cold hardening in reproductive potential after diapause termination was negligible. In non-diapause females, however, the increase in cold tolerance gained through gradual cooling could not prevent cold shock injuries, as both fecundity and survival were reduced.

J	Sharbaugh, SM				Sharbaugh, SM			Seasonal acclimatization to extreme climatic conditions by black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapilla) in interior Alaska (64 degrees N)	PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL ZOOLOGY												Winters in interior Alaska (64 degreesN) are characterized by short photoperiod (5L : 19D) and chronic subfreezing temperatures. To determine if seasonal acclimatization of black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapilla) at high latitude differs from that of conspecifics at lower latitudes, standard metabolic rates (SMR), metabolic response to low temperature (-30 degreesC), nocturnal hypothermia, body mass, fat reserves, and conductance were measured over two winters and one summer in three groups of seasonally acclimatized birds. Body mass and conductance did not vary with season, although furcular fat levels were higher in winter. Birds used nocturnal hypothermia when exposed to -30 degreesC in summer or winter. Although SMR did not vary seasonally, winter SMRs differed between the two winters of the study. Nocturnal hypothermia in summer and decreased SMR in response to extreme conditions may either reflect plasticity inherent to all populations of black-capped chickadees or may result from individual variation within this northern population.																	1522-2152					JUL-AUG	2001	74	4					568	575		10.1086/322170								WOS:000169960700011	11436141					
J	Dowell, SF				Dowell, SF			Seasonal variation in host susceptibility and cycles of certain infectious diseases	EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES												Seasonal cycles of infectious diseases have been variously attributed to changes in atmospheric conditions, the prevalence or virulence of the pathogen, or the behavior of the host. Some observations about seasonality are difficult to reconcile with these explanations. These include the simultaneous appearance of outbreaks across widespread geographic regions of the same latitude; the detection of pathogens in the off-season without epidemic spread; and the consistency of seasonal changes, despite wide variations in weather and human behavior. In contrast, an increase in susceptibility of the host population, perhaps linked to the annual light/dark cycle and mediated by the pattern of melatonin secretion, might account for many heretofore unexplained features of infectious disease seasonality. Ample evidence indicates that photoperiod-driven physiologic changes are typical in mammalian species, including some in humans. If such physiologic changes underlie human resistance to infectious diseases for large portions of the year and the changes can be identified and modified, the therapeutic and preventive implications may be considerable.																	1080-6040					MAY-JUN	2001	7	3					369	374										WOS:000168952200001	11384511

We monitored body temperatures (T-b) of 5 black-tailed prairie dogs in the field for about 100 days during winter and spring 1998-1999. All animals entered torpor during this period. Major torpor bouts averaged 140.5 h +/- 2.4 SD (range = 77.6-214.4) with a minimum T-b of 19.0 +/- 3.6 degreesC. Minor torpor bouts averaged 46.2 +/- 20.9 h (9.5-98.5), with minimum T-b reaching 30.3 +/- 2.3 degreesC. There was no distinct relationship between ambient air temperature (T-a) and entry into torpor. All torpor bouts occurred following a sudden reduction in T-a, but not all sudden reductions in T-a induced torpor. Precipitation was not associated with entry into or arousal from torpor. Our study demonstrates that facultative torpor occurs in free-ranging black-tailed prairie dogs in the field.																	0022-2372					MAY	2001	82	2					551	557		10.1644/1545-1542(2001)082<0551:FTIFRB>2.0.CO;2								WOS:000168879100027						
J	Baskauf, SJ; McCauley, DE				Baskauf, SJ; McCauley, DE			Evaluation of low temperature mortality as a range-limiting factor for the southwestern corn borer (Lepidoptera : Crambidae)	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												Evolutionary and ecological factors were used to assess the likelihood that low winter temperatures limit the range of Diatraea grandiosella Dyar (southwestern corn borer) in the east central United States. In controlled low-temperature mortality trials, dry diapausing laboratory-reared larvae were exposed for 2 d to constant temperatures, ranging from -6.9 to - 10.0 degreesC. Mortality of larvae originating from Indiana at the northern range edge was not significantly different from mortality of larvae from Mississippi, over 500 km to the south. However, lan ae from these populations had significantly lower mortality than did those from Arizona, suggesting that selection for increased cold-hardiness may have occurred early in the species' northeastward invasion of the central United States. Temperatures inside intact maize root crowns, the overwintering location of D. grandiosella, were measured over three winters in fields near the species' northern range edge. Although air temperatures fell below -19 degreesC for up to five consecutive days, root crown temperatures only approached -8 degreesC for periods of a few hours, due primarily to an underappreciated mitigating effect of freezing soil water. Because larvae originating from the east central United States had >60% survival when exposed to -8.8 degreesC for 2 d in the laboratory trials, mortality at the range edge caused by low temperatures was unlikely to have been severe for dry larvae during the three winters during which temperatures were measured. These results suggest that in most years, low winter temperatures are probably not the most important limiting factor at the species' northern range edge in the east central United States.

J	Gemeno, C; Haynes, KF				Gemeno, C; Haynes, KF			Impact of photoperiod on the sexual behavior of the black cutworm moth (Lepidoptera : Noctuidae)	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												We tested the hypothesis that changes in photoperiod alone are responsible fur the delay in the onset of sexual maturity that has been previously observed in natural populations of the migratory black cutworm, Agrotis ipsilon (Hufnagel), moth. We hypothesized that under short days, which occur at the onset of the spring and fall migrations, the first age at which males and females engage in sexual communication would be later than under long days typical of nonmigratory periods. Individuals were kept at 25 degreesC from egg to adult under three photoregimes that they encounter in nature at different latitudes: 12:12 (L:D) h (late March and late September), li:Ib (L:D) h, and 16:8 (L:D) h. As predicted, the mean age at which females first called (i.e., released pheromone) was earlier under long-day than under short-day photoregimes, but this trend was not significant. The percentage of females that called over a 6-d-period a as similar among photoregimes but it varied with age. There was no interaction between photoperiod and age on the percentage of females calling. Pheromone production, measured as the quantity of Z7-12:Ac in pheromone gland extracts, was lower under long-day than under short-day photoregimes. On average, 1-d-old females produced less pheromone than older females. Photoperiod and age showed a significant interaction in their effect on the quantity of Z7-12:Ac, but not in the direction predicted by our hypothesis. Males reared under short days showed higher percentages of response than did males reared under long days. Age had a significant effect on male response but it was independent from the effect of photoperiod. We conclude that although photoperiod length can influence calling, pheromone production, and male response, it has little effect on the age at which A. ipsilon reach sexual maturity. Changes in photoperiod alone cannot explain the delayed maturity observed in the field. Other factors, alone or in combination with photoperiod, may be necessary to induce the reproductive diapause that A. ipsilon undergoes in its fall migration.				gemeno, cesar/H-5223-2011	gemeno, cesar/0000-0001-5543-6141												0046-225X					APR	2001	30	2					189	195		10.1603/0046-225X-30.2.189								WOS:000168437900005						
J	Mandak, B; Pysek, P				Mandak, B; Pysek, P			Fruit dispersal and seed banks in Atriplex sagittata: the role of heterocarpy	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 Atriplex sagittata, an arly succesional, annual species of disturbed habitats in Central Europe, produces three types of fruits. We studied the differences in dispersal between the fruit types in order to investigate their ecological roles. 2 The typical positive relationship between dispersal ability and germinability is not found in this species. Type A (ebracteate) fruits produced deeply dormant seeds and had the lowest dispersal potential, but of the two fruits with bracts, type B, with dormant seeds, was better dispersed by both water and wind than type C, which produces non-dormant seeds. 3 Wind, temperature and precipitation have significant effects on fruit release but their effects differ between fruit types. The release of fruit types with bracts was positively correlated with wind whereas all fruit types tended to be negatively correlated with precipitation and temperature range. 4 Type C fruit, which contains non-dormant seed, are absent from the soil in summer and have a Type II transient seed bank. Type A and B fruits, containing dormant seeds, form a persistent seed bank. 5 Heterocarpy, where fruit types show distinct ecological behaviour, enables colonizing species such as A. sagittata to survive both major disturbance (by ensuring that some seeds persist) and unfavourable conditions (by spreading germination over a long period). 6 In A. sagittata, seed dynamics can be explained by the germination behaviour of seeds produced by the three types of fruit. All fruit types mature in autumn, but few of Type A fall from the mother plant until spring, when germination is probably inhibited because of insufficient stratification. Type C fruit, however show peak dispersal in winter and the majority of these non-dormant seeds are able to germinate as soon as conditions become more suitable.

A latitudinal cline was found in the photoperiodic response controlling reproductive diapause: the lower the latitude, the lower the diapause incidence and the shorter the critical daylength. To examine the overwintering success, eight strains including four species derived from different latitudes (26-43 degrees N) were reared outdoors in Tsukuba (36 degrees N), central Japan from the autumn of 1998 to the summer of 1999, and their winter survival and spring fecundity were recorded. Most females of the northern strains entered diapause in the autumn when the temperature was still high, and died before winter without oviposition. In the southern strains including a nondiapause Okinawa (26 degrees N) strain of O. strigicollis, females overwintered as well as native strains in a state of quiescence. In all strains, the winter survival was significantly lower in males than in females, and eggs and nymphs failed to overwinter.																	0013-8703					MAR	2001	98	3					303	316		10.1046/j.1570-7458.2001.00787.x								WOS:000167852200007						
J	Henry, CJ; Day, KR				Henry, C. J.; Day, K. R.			Egg allocation by Bracon hylobii Ratz., the principal parasitoid of the large pine weevil (Hylobius abietis L.), and implications for host suppression	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST ENTOMOLOGY												1 The braconid parasitoid Bracon hylobii Ratz. is one of the few specialist natural enemies of the large pine weevil, Hylobius abietis L., a destructive pest of conifer transplants. An assessment of its role as an agent of biological control requires a detailed knowledge of the allocation of its reproductive effort. 2 Parasitoid females were continuously observed in laboratory culture with individually reared host larvae in bark discs. The outcome of sequential parasitoid-host encounters was recorded by subsequent examination of hosts and by rearing all parasitoids. 3 Parasitoids avoided ovipositing on host larvae < 100 mg fresh weight, even though such larvae represented sufficient biomass for complete parasitoid development. All larger larvae were vulnerable to attack, which leaves a window of vulnerability for parasitoids of about 90% of weevil larval life. 4 Parasitoids presented with a range of host sizes showed no preference above 100 mg for the size of host first attacked, but allocated more eggs and a greater total handling time to larger hosts. 5 Most eggs were deposited on the first host attacked, with progressively fewer allocated to subsequent hosts. However, oviposition experience did not affect the time spent on the next host. 6 From these results it is anticipated that when weevil larval size is reduced by less favourable feeding substrates, fewer parasitoid eggs will be allocated to each but more host larvae will ultimately be attacked. 7 Generation time, host finding, oviposition rate, clutch size, life expectancy and diapause induction are strongly affected by temperature. Life expectancy is substantially shorter for parasitoids deprived of non-host food supplement. At 15 and 20 degrees C the number of hosts attacked and the number of eggs deposited decreased with female age. 8 Bracon hylobii is inevitably poorly synchronized with a variable life-cycle host; it is egg-limited and can enter diapause at a relatively high field temperature. None of these characteristics suggest that it could stabilize the abundance of its host below an economically acceptable threshold density. However, the reproductive potential of the parasitoid suggests that it could make a significant contribution to larval mortality and suppress adult recruitment, thus complementing other control strategies.																	1461-9555	1461-9563				FEB	2001	3	1					11	18		10.1046/j.1461-9563.2001.00080.x								WOS:000208951800003						
J	Litchman, E; Klausmeier, CA				Litchman, E; Klausmeier, CA			Competition of phytoplankton under fluctuating light	AMERICAN NATURALIST												Light is an essential resource for phytoplankton and fluctuates on a wide range of timescales. To understand how light fluctuations affect phytoplankton community structure and diversity, we have studied a set of simple models using a combination of analytical and numerical techniques. Light fluctuations can affect community structure when species exhibit the gleaner-opportunist trade-off between competitive ability and ability to reach carrying capacity quickly. Fast fluctuations can switch the competitive dominant from a gleaner to an opportunist; slow fluctuations can cause this switch and also lead to stable coexistence. Coexistence is easiest between species that are highly differentiated along the gleaner-opportunist trade-off. Our results remain qualitatively unchanged when more realistic light fluctuations such as daily and seasonal changes in irradiance and the presence of a spatial gradient in light are considered. Seasonal change in day length may be one of the factors driving the seasonal succession of phytoplankton, from opportunist species dominant under shorter day lengths (spring and autumn) to gleaner species dominant under longer day length (summer). These results illustrate how resource fluctuations can have an important role in structuring ecological communities.

Most populations on the four main islands of Japan, irrespective of the host species on which they occurred expressed more than 90% diapause at 15 degreesC, whereas populations on the Okinawa islands exhibited a very low incidence or no diapause. The incidence of diapause decreased when temperature was increased from 18 to 20 degreesC in populations from warmer areas such as southern Kyushu and Honshu. This temperature-dependent decline in diapause incidence was most conspicuous in populations from Tanegashima and Yakushima Islands. The incidence of diapause at 20 degreesC tended to be lower in populations derived from tea than those from deciduous hosts in the same, warmer areas, showing that the former have a lower capacity for diapause. The present results, together with previously published data for T. urticae, showed that the lower temperature threshold for diapause induction was higher in T: kanzawai than in T. urticae and thus the clinal decrease in diapause percentage occurred at much lower latitudes in the former at 20 degreesC.

Seeds were sampled before dispersal from dry shoots (in autumn and winter), separately from 3 or 5 randomly selected plants at each locality. Germinability was tested 40 60 d after haar vest, at constant 25 degreesC and light. The incidence of innate seed dormancy was generally high. Average proportion of germinable seeds was below ten percent at 64% of localities of R. crispus and 49% of localities of R. obtusifolius. in both species, there was a significant variation of germinability between localities within geographic regions but differences between regions were small. Significant geographic differences were found in R. crispus where there was a trend for increasing germination percentage as one moves from southern to northern regions and from low to high altitudes (established at localities of Spain). The trends may indicate a selection fbr late flowering ecotypes with a decreased incidence of innate seed dormancy.

The relationship between the developmental rate (1/d) and the temperature (degreesC) was determined using both linear and nonlinear (Logan type III) models. The fit of the linear regression in the temperature range 15-27.5 degreesC and Logan type III equation was good (R-2 > 0.97). The lower developmental threshold, calculated using the linear model, was t(b) = 12 degreesC. The nonlinear model gave a higher threshold of T-max = 36 degreesC, and an optimal developmental temperature of T-max = 30 degreesC. The nights of S. nonagrioides were studied in Lleida, Spain, from 1984 to 1997, and the number of degree-days required for their occurrence was calculated. A relationship between the degree-days required for the first night calculated ly the averaging method and the degree-days required for estimated diapause termination was obtained (R-2 = 0.84). This relationship allowed the prediction of the first night occurrence in the field.

J	Kojola, I; Laitala, HM				Kojola, I; Laitala, HM			Body size variation of brown bear in Finland	ANNALES ZOOLOGICI FENNICI												Brown bear (Ursus arctos) can be predicted to have larger autumn body mass in the north than south because the duration of winter dormancy lengthens towards the north. We examined variation of body size among hunter-killed female and male brown bears within a latitudal range of 60 and 68 degreesN in Finland. The body size of males (mass, contour length) decreased towards the north while our data did not indicate such a trend in females. Our results do not coincide with Bergmann's rule suggesting increasing body size with decreasing ambient temperature, probably owing to energy-saving winter dormancy during which brown bear is not overtly exposed to weather conditions. Secondly, possible differences in the quality of green forage might not largely influence the nutrition of an omnivorous mammal.																	0003-455X						2001	38	2					173	178										WOS:000169811400009

One population was from Lexington, KY (N38 degrees 04', W84 degrees 29'), and the other from Tifton, GA (N31 degrees 28',W83 degrees 31'). Six photoperiods were used in the experiment tall at 24 +/- 1 degreesC): 10:14, 11:13, 12:12, 13:11, 14:10, and 15:9 (L:D) h. Photoperiod and population had significant effects on the developmental times of embryos and nymphs. However, the developmental differences had no apparent relationship with photoperiod, and those between populations were slight (<1 d). The incidence of diapause increased for both populations as photoperiod decreased, but at daylengths shorter than 14:10 (L:D) h, the frequency of diapause increased much more steeply in the Kentucky population than in the Georgia one. At its peak, the incidence of diapause in the Georgia population (40.9%; 10:14 [L:D] h) was about half that of the peak of the Kentucky population (81.8%; 12:12 [L:D] h). Also, the critical photoperiod for diapause induction was <approximate to>1 h longer in the Kentucky population than in the Georgia population. The preoviposition period was notably affected by photoperiod, and this effect differed between populations Short daylengths prolonged the preoviposition period in both populations, but the contraction of the preoviposition period in response to longer daylength was more pronounced in the Georgia population. The considerable difference in diapause incidence between the two populations may reflect the relative predictability of inclement conditions in the respective locations.

J	Jones, RE				Jones, RE			Mechanisms for locating resources in space and time: Impacts on the abundance of insect herbivores	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY					Symposium on Insect-Eucalypt Interactions	FEB 07-08, 2000	CANBERRA, AUSTRALIA					Herbivorous insects have the problem both of locating appropriate host plants and ensuring that the plant-feeding stages of their life cycles are synchronized with the times when those hosts provide a high-quality food resource. Because the taxonomic range of potential hosts is generally narrow, and the temporal window when those hosts are suitable is often relatively short, developmental (especially diapause) and dispersal mechanisms may be critical factors in determining whether or not a species population is successful in a particular plant community. The present paper considers the impact of diapause and dispersal mechanisms on the ability of insect herbivores to cope with two attributes of their host plants: (i) the diversity of the plant community within which the hosts are located; and (ii) the seasonal predictability of host suitability. Some common dispersal mechanisms used by insect herbivores are much more appropriate to low-diversity than to high-diversity plant communities and, similarly, some diapause cues are appropriate only to highly predictable plant phenology. Both agriculture and silviculture characteristically manipulate both these attributes of plant communities, that is, in order to make the human use of plants more efficient, cultivation strategies normally both reduce plant species diversity (often to a condition approaching monoculture) and increase the predictability of plant developmental patterns. Consequently, major pest species in managed systems may not be those that are most common in natural systems, and may be difficult to predict in advance.

Several bio-assays were performed using either direct exposure of the host beetle to the pathogens, or pots containing soil inoculated with M. anisopliae conidia at a rate of 2 x 10(8) per ml soil. Parasitised and unparasitised M. aeneus larvae were collected in the field and were placed for pupation in the test soil. The effect of treatment on M. aeneus and D. capito was estimated after adult emergence, and the effect on P. morionellus was estimated by dissecting hibernating pupae. While both of the M. anisopliae strains were highly pathogenic to M. aeneus adults and larvae upon direct exposure, soil treatment resulted in no significant difference between the number of insects emerging (or found) from the treated and untreated pots. However, the treated insects appeared to be latently infected and the actual infection rate had to be estimated after their death and incubation in a moist chamber. The mortality of the beetles caused by direct exposure to the fungus was 85% (range 70-88%). The rate of latent infection following indirect exposure via treated soil in deep pots in laboratory was 80% (range 49-100%), while that in P. morionellus was only 17% (range 0-85%), and in D. capito significantly higher, 76% (range 72-100%). The results indicate that M. anisopliae is a potentially useful candidate to be used as a bio-insecticide to control the pollen beetle, and that at least the most abundant parasitoid, Phradis morionellus, is less affected than the target pest itself. The possible ecological role of latent infections in the host as well as in some of the parasitoids needs to be clarified.																	1386-6141						2001	46	3					261	273		10.1023/A:1011479616787								WOS:000169736700001						
J	Kemp, DJ; Jones, RE				Kemp, DJ; Jones, RE			Phenotypic plasticity in field populations of the tropical butterfly Hypolimnas bolina (L.) (Nymphalidae)	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY												Phenotypic plasticity may enable organisms to maximize their fitness in seasonally variable environments. However, in butterflies, seasonal polyphenism is often striking but functionally obscure. This paper addresses the possible adaptive significance of phenotypic variation in the tropical butterfly Hypolimnas bolina (L.) (Nymphalidae). Plasticity in body size and wing coloration can be elicited in this species under laboratory conditions, however it is not known how this plasticity is expressed in the wild. Moreover, adult H. bolina spend the winter dry season in a reproductive diapause, which allows certain predictions regarding the occurrence of seasonal plasticity. Based on consideration of the requirements of diapausing and directly developing individuals, we predicted that if seasonal plasticity in phenotype were adaptive, then overwintering individuals should be larger and darker than their directly developing counterparts. This prediction was largely - although not entirely - fulfilled. Dry season butterflies were duller and darker than their wet season counterparts (this plasticity was superimposed on a genetic colour polymorphism), however size plasticity varied geographically. Dry season adults were consistently larger than wet season adults in the tropical north, but not in the south. We use these findings to discuss the possible adaptive significance of seasonal variation in the colour and size of this tropical butterfly. (C) 2001 The Linnean Society of London.

J	Shefferson, RP; Sandercock, BK; Proper, J; Beissinger, SR				Shefferson, RP; Sandercock, BK; Proper, J; Beissinger, SR			Estimating dormancy and survival of a rare herbaceous perennial using mark-recapture models	ECOLOGY												Mark-recapture statistics have rarely been applied to plants, yet they can be useful for estimating plant demographic traits where individuals may be missed or unobservable. We applied mark-recapture statistics based on an information theory approach to estimate annual probabilities of dormancy in a five-year study of a threatened, perennial plant, the small yellow lady's slipper orchid (Cypripedium calceolus ssp. parviflorum (Salisb.) Fernald). The aboveground states of 548 genets in eight patches were monitored over five years. Apparent survival probabilities (phi), corrected for dormancy, were calculated. The best-fit model suggested that apparent survival was constant throughout the study for all patches, while dormancy varied additively with time among patches. The mean probability of dormancy was 0.320 +/- 0.024, with a mean maximum overestimation of 0.067 as calculated using an estimate of the probability of detection. Dormancy typically lasted for no longer than two consecutive years, although dormancy as long as four years was observed. Dormancy displayed a strong covariate relationship with spring frost days, although effects of precipitation and mean spring temperature were almost equally strong. Mean apparent survival probabilities were high in each patch (phi = 0.878), but dormancy probabilities varied considerably among patches (d = 0.188-0.672). Conventional resprouting probabilities underestimated apparent survival by a mean difference of 0.288 (range: 0.150-0.589). This novel application of mark-recapture statistics to plant demography allowed robust survival estimates that accounted for uncertainty due to an unobservable, dormant life stage.

(Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) collected while hidden in grass tussocks in hibernation sites (HID) and in beetles collected on plants (PLA). The duration of tethered flight of HID beetles measured in the laboratory in late August and September 1995 (range of geometric means 190-440 s) was slightly longer than the flight of PLA beetles (80-310 s), both being much longer than trivial flight recorded in beetles foraging for prey during the breeding season (35 s). In general, the flight performance had a tendency to increase in September and to decrease in October. The oxygen consumption in HID beetles increased throughout September 1994 from 430 to 780 mul g(-1) h(-1) and throughout October 1995 from 710 to 1060 mul g(-1) h(-1). This increase is ascribed to a concomitant decrease in diapause intensity. A similar increase was observed also in PLA beetles in 1994 and oxygen consumption was always higher than in HID beetles, most probably due to feeding and digestion in PLA beetles. Laboratory feeding of HID beetles on aphids induced maturation of ovaries and increased oxygen uptake (from 680 to 1110 mul g(-1) h(-1)). Feeding on honey and pollen left their oxygen uptake unchanged. Effect of feeding on the flight parameters was mostly not significant. In agreement with its less suitable body shape and usually less distant dormancy sites, C. septempunctata was found a less apt flier than long-distance migrating coccinellid species.

J	Arendt, MD; Lucy, JA; Evans, DA				Arendt, MD; Lucy, JA; Evans, DA			Diel and seasonal activity patterns of adult tautog, Tautoga onitis, in lower Chesapeake Bay, inferred from ultrasonic telemetry	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Recent advances in ultrasonic telemetry have enabled researchers to simultaneously collect telemetry data on numerous tagged individuals without remaining in direct contact with them. We present a low cost, commercially available automated acoustic receiver system from which presence/absence data can be used to infer diel activity patterns. We monitored a large, temperate labrid, Tautoga onitis, but the methods and analyses presented here have direct application to other marine species. Data were analyzed using graphical analysis, harmonic analysis, and empirical eigenfunction analysis. Diel activity patterns were expressed in the context of photoperiod, water temperature, and tidal flow. Detection periodicity was strongly diel (24-h cycle), with detection predominantly during daylight hours only (diurnal). Diurnal detection persisted throughout the study. Daily detection was greatest in the morning or afternoon during slack tide. Daily detection varied seasonally with ambient water temperature and was greatest between 13-20 degreesC, corresponding to the primary fishing seasons for Tautoga onitis in spring and fall. This study represented the first use of automated acoustic receivers to investigate seasonal changes in diel activity patterns of adult tautog and only the second application of ultrasonic telemetry to study this species. This study was also the first to address diel activity patterns of adult tautog in the southern range of this species' distribution.																	0378-1909						2001	62	4					379	391		10.1023/A:1012266214143								WOS:000171802400002

For this purpose individuals from three geographical populations (Israel, Spain and Czech Republic) were reared under different photoperiods and the wing length of the adults analyzed. The highest percentage of long-winged (macropterous) specimens was found in the population from Israel (35.3%), whereas percentages of macroptery were lower in the cultures from Spain (9.5%) and Czech Republic (8.6%). A higher proportion of macropterous specimens was recorded in the northern population of P. apterus kept under long daylengths (Czech Republic, 16 h) than in the southern populations (Spain, 14-15 h; Israel, 12 h). The results indicate that there is a latitudinal gradient in the critical photoperiod determining wing length in P. apterus.																	1210-5759						2001	98	2					167	169		10.14411/eje.2001.030								WOS:000169837800005						
J	Bruelheide, H; Lieberum, K				Bruelheide, H; Lieberum, K			Experimental tests for determining the causes of the altitudinal distribution of Meum athamanticum Jacq. in the Harz Mountains	FLORA												The objective of this study is to identify possible causes for the altitudinal limitation of a plant species with montane distribution, i.e. Meum athamanticum. The response of its growth to altitude was measured along an elevational gradient from 170 m to 1130 m a.s.l. in the Hart Mountains, Germany. Naturally occurring Meum plants and different age classes that had been transplanted to 7 sites along this gradient were monitored for several growth parameters. The growth rates differed only slightly among altitudes, a sign of a low phenotypical plasticity The germination requirements were analyzed in growth chambers using different pre-treatments and temperatures. The seeds had a secondary dormancy that was effectively broken by a pre-treatment of alternating temperatures; whereas the temperature at germination time exerted almost no effect on germination rates. No specific requirements related to montane climate were detected. The plant's frost tolerance directly after sprouting in spring was examined in freeze chamber experiments. Since significant frost damage detected by electrolyte leakage was observed only at -9 degrees C or below, frost sensitivity was excluded as a cause for the altitudinal distribution limit. The acclimation of net photosynthesis was measured by comparing the temperature optimum of autochthonous individuals and transplants. The optima differed only by 0.5 K between plants grown at 170 m or 600 m a.s.l. which indicates a low adaptive capability. The reduction of starch concentration as the main storage carbohydrate in Meum roots was monitored in natural populations and in transplants. The loss of starch during the winter was substantial at all sites but was highest at the lowest elevation. The general conclusion from our study is that Meum athamanticum is restricted to montane sites because its low phenotypical plasticity does not allow the exploitation of more favourable climatic conditions in the lowlands. In addition, the ability of Meum plants to thrive at higher temperatures is probably reduced by the carbon loss in winter.

Genetic parameters and geographic variation in adaptive traits were studied to tailor breeding populations to specific climatic environments. Orthogonal clines were identified in bud break and growth cessation with spatial statistical analysis, implying that it is not possible to cope with effects of climatic warming by simply shifting provenances to new locations. Instead climatic warming may require the development of genotypes with novel combinations in adaptive traits. Selection targets for bud break and leaf abscission for six breeding populations were derived that cover current and possible future climatic conditions. Genetic parameters for adaptive traits were estimated, and it was confirmed that selection targets for the proposed breeding populations could be met in one generation. Heritabilities for the date of bud break and leaf abscission were moderately high (0.41 to 0.54) and genetic correlations implied that selection for advanced bud break and delayed growth cessation will positively influence growth traits.																			1-4020-0236-X				2001	70						321	330										WOS:000175261600026

Research conducted in a tropically sited, controlled-environment photoperiodic facility (PF) from 1991 to 1997 explored the interaction of environmental and management variables with the initiation process. Potted plants, primarily of nine selected cultivars, raised under controlled conditions, were subjected to a broad range of management and PF-imposed photoperiodic treatments. Most of the 17 experiments providing data were conducted sequentially. The commencement of initiation within three months from I April resulted in a high probability of obtaining excellent initiation ((x) over bar = 86%), largely a consequence of avoiding days with maxima >32degreesC. Initiation of plants directly from maintenance in long days was highly successful without use of pre-treatment regimes. Use of artificial sunsets and sunrises was superior to natural sunsets and artificial sunrises, a consequence of photoperiodic precision and accuracy. A photoperiodic regime using an 11 h 05 min commencing night length, increasing by either 30 or 45 s/night, was near optimal. The role of plant nutrition requires further clarification. Research in a tropical-based PF has defined a minimalist PF regime that will have broad application in tropical and non-tropical programs.																			0-949678-10-4				2001							482	487										WOS:000189401900109

Melatonin, a daylength information conveyor, shows the same plasma levels in female lambs as in male lambs. We therefore tested the hypothesis that the predominant melatonin binding sites, located in the pars tuberalis (PT) of the pituitary, might display sexual dimorphism. Here, in two independent experiments, we report no difference in quantity, density or dissociation constant between female and male peripubertal lambs' PT melatonin binding sites, measured by individual saturation curves. In October, Bmax values were 19.5 +/- 1.8 and 19.6 +/- 1.2, whereas in June. they were 94.1 +/- 8.6 and 96.4 +/- 12.1 fmol/mg protein (mean +/- S.E.M.) for females and males, respectively. The Kd values were in the range of 10-20 pmol. The sexual parameters measured, i.e. presence of corpus luteum in female ovaries or testis weight in male lambs, were not linked with PT melatonin binding numbers.																	0742-3098	1600-079X				JAN	2001	30	1					50	55		10.1034/j.1600-079X.2001.300107.x								WOS:000166362900007	11168907

These populations were compared with two populations, Fr1 and Fr4 from southern and northen France, respectively, which represent two ecotypes with respect to hatching cycles in response to temperature. The two Algerian populations hatched over a wide range of constant temperatures (3 to 25 degreesC) but differed in the times at which juveniles emerged from the cysts. Simulation of seasonal temperature variations (from summer to autumn or winter and, conversely, from winter to spring or summer) demonstrated diapause in these two populations, induced by higher temperature (20 and 25 degreesC) treatments and broken subsequently by lower temperatures (3 and 7 degreesC). Both Algerian populations of H. avenae represent the Mediterranean ecotype, with biological variations that may represent regional adaptations to more or less severe climatic conditions.																	1388-5545						2001	3		2				171	178		10.1163/156854101750236303								WOS:000169656800008

Early laboratory studies identified potential limitations for their successful establishment in northern California where these parasitoids were extensively colonized and evaluated against Russian wheat aphid. Specifically, those studies showed that A. albipodus was particularly susceptible to moderately low temperatures (10 degrees C). These results for A. albipodus were in contradiction with seasonal field temperatures prevalent in its collection site (Tahcheng, People's Republic of China) where field temperatures are below freezing for several months each year. This study sought to reconcile these apparently contradictory results. We examined whether short daylength-induced diapause, i.e, winter diapause, occurs in A. albipodus and D. rapae, and thus could be used as an overwintering strategy by these parasitoids. Under laboratory conditions, > 2/3 of A. albipodus individuals entered diapause when daylength was reduced from 14 h to 12 h. In contrast, diapause was not detected in D. rapae under the same conditions. However, we suggested that diapause may occur in D, rapae under shorter daylengths because (i) this parasitoid's development and survivorship are not affected by temperatures associated with 12 h daylengths at its collection site (Wuqia, PRC), and (ii) other studies have demonstrated diapause in this parasitoid at daylengths < 12 h. We discuss our results in light of A. albipodus' rapid establishment in northern California, and the use of our analytical procedure as a component of a process for screening natural enemies in importation biological control programs.																	0031-0603					JAN	2001	77	1					28	36										WOS:000166369000004

The relatively short (2.14 cm) K-u-band of the space-borne NASA scatterometer (NSCAT) is sensitive to changes in dielectric properties, associated with large-scale shifts in the relative abundance and phase (frozen or thawed) of canopy and surface water. We used a temporal change detection analysis of NSCAT daily radar backscatter measurements to classify surface freeze/thaw state across a 1.4 million km(2) region of Alaska from January to June 1997. In the spring, radar backscatter measurements showed pronounced decreases (1.6-4.9 dB) relative to reference frozen state conditions, which corresponded with sustained maximum daily air temperature measurements above 0.0 degreesC and total decreases in measured snow depths from 28% to 61% of seasonal maximum values. We classified the daily frozen and nonfrozen area for the region based on the sign (+/-) of the radar backscatter temporal difference relative to frozen and nonfrozen reference conditions. These results compared favorably (e.g., r(2) = 0.881; p less than or equal to 0.0001) with frozen area estimates derived from the regional weather station network. NSCAT-derived estimates of the timing and spatial variation in regional thaw during spring were also generally consistent with seasonal increases in river discharge for five major Alaska basins. The NSCAT sensor appears to be responsive to changes in dielectric properties associated with surface freeze/thaw transitions over broad boreal and arctic landscapes. Further study involving longer time-series information, alternative radar wavelengths, and finer spatial scales is needed, however, to resolve the various components (i.e., soil, vegetation, snow) of the regional radar freeze/thaw signature for improved monitoring of the circumpolar high latitudes.

We tested prescribed burning and root trenching treatments as proxies for the surface fires and reduced tree densities characteristic of historic ponderosa pine ecosystems in a study area at O'Leary Peak, part of the Sunset Crater volcanic field (Coconino National Forest, AZ). Prescribed burning killed many mature P. clutei plants and negatively affected density for at least 3 years post-bum. In contrast, trenching to cut root competition of over-story trees led to a 1200 percent increase in P. clutei plants. Precipitation influenced the response. Seed germination experiments showed that P. clutei does not have innate dormancy. Germination rates in the lab ranged from 5 to 70 percent under a range of environmental and fire-related conditions (i.e., cold stratification, light, exposure to ash, NH4), but these factors were not statistically significant. Tested seedling establishment rates in situ were very low (0.4%). These experiments suggest that the observed P. clutei population increase following severe wildfires (1973 Burnt fire, 1996 Hochderffer fire) may have been due primarily to the removal of tree competition rather than to direct fire effects. Further experimentation is suggested to develop ecological information for thoughtful integration of ecosystem restoration with the habitat needs of rare plants.																							2001		23					139	152										WOS:000175529000019

Autogenous larvae become abundant mainly in enclosed sites and anautogenous larvae in sites that provide free access and egress. Both populations begin to proliferate when the water temperature exceeds 15degreesC during June. Larval anautogenous mosquitoes increase in abundance 10-fold in two weeks and autogenous in three weeks. Although anautogenous larvae rapidly disappear after mid-August when winter diapause commences, the abundance of autogenous larvae continues to increase until mid-October. The forms generally are reproductively isolated In nature but occasionally hybridize during August and thereafter. Anautogenous females feed mainly on birds; autogenous females generally never feed on blood; and hybrid females appear to feed indiscriminately on avian or mammalian hosts. Such northern C. p. pipiens mosquitoes range as far south as 33degreesN. Taken together, these observations suggest that C. p. pipiens-borne pathogens may proliferate in the northern United States until mid-August and affect human hosts thereafter. Intensity of transmission decreases toward the south.																	0077-8923		1-57331-374-2				2001	951						220	234										WOS:000173778000020	11797779					
J	Hagen, W; Auel, H				Hagen, W; Auel, H			Seasonal adaptations and the role of lipids in oceanic zooplankton	ZOOLOGY-ANALYSIS OF COMPLEX SYSTEMS					94th Annual Meeting of the German-Zoological-Society	JUN 04-08, 2001	UNIV OSNABRUCK, OSNABRUCK, GERMANY	German Zoolog Soc	UNIV OSNABRUCK			Oceanic zooplankton species exhibit quite diverse life history traits. A major driving force determining their life strategies is the seasonal variability in food supply, which is most pronounced in polar oceans where fluctuations in primary production are extreme. Seasonal adaptations are closely related to the trophic level of zooplankters, with strongest pressures occurring on herbivorous organisms. The dominant grazers, calanoid copepods and krill (Euphausiacea), have developed fascinating solutions for successful overwintering at higher latitudes. They usually exhibit a very efficient storage and utilization of energy reserves to reduce the effect of a highly seasonal primary production. The predominant larger Calanus species from the Arctic and Calanoides acutus from the Antarctic biosynthesize large amounts of high-energy wax esters with Iong-chain monounsaturated fatty acids and alcohols (20:1 and 22:1 isomers) as major components. They survive the dark season at depth in a stage of dormancy called diapause. In contrast, the Antarctic Calanus propinquus, a winter-active species, synthesizes primarily triacylglycerols, which are dominated by long-chain monounsaturated fatty acids with 22 carbon atoms (2 isomers) and yield even higher calorific contents. The omnivorous and carnivorous species, which are less subjected to seasonal food shortage, usually do not exhibit such an elaborate lipid biosynthesis. Herbivores usually do not utilize much of their enormous lipid reserves for overwintering, but channel this energy towards reproductive processes in late winter/early spring. Timing of reproduction is critical especially at high latitudes due to the short production period, and lipid reserves ensure early spawning independent of external resources. These energetic adaptations (dormancy, lipid storage) are supplemented by other life strategies such as extensive vertical migrations, change in the mode of life, and trophic flexibility.																	0944-2006						2001	104	3-4					313	326		10.1078/0944-2006-00037								WOS:000174431600017	16351846					
J	Butturini, A; Sabater, F				Butturini, A; Sabater, F			Seasonal variability of dissolved organic carbon in a Mediterranean stream	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												The seasonal variability of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) flux in a Mediterranean stream subjected to discharges of wide range of intensities and variable dry period was studied as a function of the hydrologic conditions, and the relationship between surface and subsurface (hyporheic and groundwater) DOC concentration. DOC concentration in stream water (2.6 mg l(-1) +/- 1.5 SD) was higher than groundwater (1.3 mg l(-1) +/- 1.2 SD) and lower than hyporheic water (3.8 mg l(-1) +/- 1.7 SD), suggesting that, at baseflow, stream DOC concentration increases when groundwater discharges through the hyporheic zone. Storms contributed to 39% of annual water export and to 52% of the total annual DOC export (220 kg km(-2)). A positive relationship was observed between Discharge (Q) and stream DOC concentration. Discharge explained only 40% of the annual variance in stream DOC, but explained up to 93% of the variance within floods. The rate of stream DOC changes with discharge change during storms (dDOC/dQ), ranged between 0 and 0.0045 C mg l(-1) s l(-1), with minimum values during Spring and Summer, and maxima values in Fall and Winter. These dynamics suggest that storm inputs of terrigenous DOC vary between seasons. During floods in the dormant season, DOC recession curves were always steeper than discharge decline, suggesting short flushing of DOC from the leaching of fresh detritus stored in the riparian zone.

J	Foley, JA; Levis, S; Costa, MH; Cramer, W; Pollard, D				Foley, JA; Levis, S; Costa, MH; Cramer, W; Pollard, D			Incorporating dynamic vegetation cover within global climate models	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Numerical models of Earth's climate system must consider the atmosphere and terrestrial biosphere as a coupled system, with biogeophysical and biogeochemical processes occurring across a range of timescales. On short timescales (i.e., seconds to hours), the coupled system is dominated by the rapid biophysical and biogeochemical processes that exchange energy, water, carbon dioxide, and momentum between the atmosphere and the land surface. Intermediate-timescale (i.e., days to months) processes include changes in the store of soil moisture, changes in carbon allocation, and vegetation phenology (e.g., budburst, leaf-out, senescence, dormancy). On longer timescales (i.e., seasons, years, and decades), there can be fundamental changes in the vegetation structure itself (disturbance, land use, stand growth). In order to consider the full range of coupled atmosphere-biosphere processes, we must extend climate models to include intermediate and long-term ecological phenomena. This paper reviews early attempts at linking climate and equilibrium vegetation models through iterative coupling techniques, and some important insights gained through this procedure. We then summarize recent developments in coupling global vegetation and climate models, and some of the applications of these tools to modeling climate change. Furthermore, we discuss more recent developments in vegetation models (including a new class of models called "dynamic global vegetation models"), and how these models are incorporated with atmospheric general circulation models. Fully coupled climate-vegetation models are still in the very early stages of development. Nevertheless, these prototype models have already indicated the importance of considering vegetation cover as an interactive part of the climate system.

Locations ranged from Winnipeg, Manitoba (49 degrees 49' N), to Rosemount in east central Minnesota (44 degrees 44' N). Newly emerged first summer generation adults were held in field cages at each location for 7-14 d, then observed for 7 d in the laboratory for frequency of oviposition and frequency of burrowing behavior associated with diapause. Females from the Red River Valley seldom oviposited and although frequency of burrowing varied among locations it was independent of field and laboratory conditions. Under long-day laboratory conditions, 9-15% of females from east central Minnesota oviposited with frequency dependent on photoperiod experienced in the field, the critical photoperiod was 15.8 h. Under long-day laboratory conditions, 18-52% of beetles fi om east central Minnesota burrowed with frequency dependent on cumulative temperatures experienced in the field. Cool conditions were associated with higher frequencies of burrowing. Beetles front Rosemount exhibited identical responses under short-day and long-day laboratory conditions. In contrast, under short-day conditions, beetles from Big Lake did not oviposit and frequency of burrowing was not dependent on field conditions. We concluded that there is local geographic variation in Colorado potato beetle populations not only between the Red River Valley and east central Minnesota, but also among the different locations within these two areas.																	0046-225X					DEC	2000	29	6					1123	1132		10.1603/0046-225X-29.6.1123								WOS:000166389300005

Also, a forecasting model of its spring emergence was constructed based on degree-days. The development time from overwintering larva to adult emergence was not significantly different among soil moistures in the range of 10-20%, but it was different according to the timing of larval-cocoon formation in the previous year. The Height of cocoons containing an overwintering larva was less for cocoons formed after 6 October than cocoons formed before 15 September. There was a positive correlation (r = 0.47) between the overwintering larval-cocoon weight and its development time to adult. Approximately 3-4% of C, sasakii showed a prolonged diapause spending 2 yr as larval-cocoons in the soil. A greater proportion (18.4%) of heavier cocoons (>0.040 g) remained in diapause in the current year compared with normal weighed cocoons (0.022-0.040 g) (1.6%) or lighter cocoons (<0.022 g) (0%). The adult spring emergence showed a two-peak emergence pattern in which the first major peak occurred in late June and the second smaller peak in late July. A bimodal distribution model was developed to describe this emergence pattern. The bimodal model predicted more accurately C. sasakii spring emergence times than the Weibull model.																	0046-225X					DEC	2000	29	6					1188	1198		10.1603/0046-225X-29.6.1188								WOS:000166389300013						
J	Todd, TC; Long, JH; Oakley, TR				Todd, TC; Long, JH; Oakley, TR			Effects of maturity and determinacy in soybean on host-parasite relationships of Heterodera glycines	JOURNAL OF NEMATOLOGY												The effects of soybean maturity and determinacy on the host-parasite relationships of Heterodera glycines were investigated in a field microplot study over 2 years. Determinate and indeterminate isolines on the maturity group (MG) III cultivar Williams 82 and the MG V cultivar Essex were grown in microplots artificially infested with a race 3 isolate of H. glycines at three initial population (Pi) densities (0, 300, and 3,000 eggs/100 cm(3) soil). Soybean seed yields, nematode final population (Pf) densities and reproductive index (Pf/Pi), and root colonization by Macrophomina phaseolina, the causal agent of charcoal rots, were monitored in each year. Seed yields were reduced (P less than or equal to 0.05) in the presence of H. glycines in both years, but losses were greater in 1996 in the absence of drought stress. Yield loss was lower (P less than or equal to 0.06) for the determinate isoline of Essex than for the other cultivar-isoline treatments across years. Nematode reproduction was density-dependent in the more conductive environment of 1996 but was unaffected by soybean maturity of determinacy traits. Root colonization by M. phaseolina increased (P less than or equal to 0.05) in the presence of high H. glycines densities on determinate, but not indeterminate, isolines. Differences in H. glycines-induced yield loss among cultivar-isoline treatments were not related to nematode reproduction, M. phaseolina colonization, or environmental stresses. These results indicate that the effects of soybean maturity and determinacy of H. glycines-soybean interactions are not independent and that their combined effects must be considered in geographic regions where both traits vary.																	0022-300X					DEC	2000	32	4		S			584	590										WOS:000168603500017	19271013					
J	Nunes, MV; Hardie, J				Nunes, MV; Hardie, J			On critical night lengths and temperature compensation in the photoperiodic response of two geographical clones of the black bean aphid, Aphis fabae	PHYSIOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												Photoperiodic response curves were determined for two clones of the black bean aphid, Aphis fabae Scopoli, at three temperatures, 12.5, 15 and 17.5 degreesC. Critical night lengths for the induction of winged females in an English clone (52 degrees N) were 10.5, 11 and 11.5 h, respectively, and 10, 10.5 and 11 h in a Scottish clone (57 degrees N). Critical night lengths for male induction were 10.5, 11 and 11 h at 12.5, 15 and 17.5 degreesC in the English clone, and 10, 10.5 and 10.5 h, respectively, in the Scottish clone. High incidences of winged females and males were observed at all scotophases longer than the critical night length in both clones. In addition, in the English clone, the incidences of winged female and male producers in continuous darkness were 0% at 15 and 17.5 degreesC, and 6% at 12.5 degreesC. In the Scottish clone, however, continuous darkness resulted in high incidences of both winged female and male producers at 12.5 and 15 degreesC, but 0% winged female producers and 6% male producers at 17.5 degreesC. In scotophases shorter than the critical night length, including continuous light, no males or winged females were observed in either clone under the non-crowded rearing conditions used. The results are discussed in terms of the 'double circadian oscillator model' for photoperiodic induction.																	0307-6962					DEC	2000	25	4					303	308		10.1046/j.1365-3032.2000.00196.x								WOS:000165934500001

Obligate use of maternity dens for pregnancy, birth, and lactation varied little with latitude or area. In contrast, timing of facultative use of shelter dens switched from autumn in the southern area (<70<degrees>N) to winter in the northern area (>75 degreesN). For the southern area, 13 of 16 female polar bears used shelter dens in autumn versus winter (median dates of entry and exit, 11 September and 2 November; total = 56 days), whereas in the northern area, 11 of 17 bears used shelter dens in winter versus autumn (median dates, 24 December and 2 March; total = 65 days). Difference in facultative use of shelter dens was associated with conditions of sea ice, Southern regions had no sea ice when polar bears used shelter dens. In contrast, northern areas had more constant ice conditions that included presence of ice throughout the year. Southern regions seem to have greater primary productivity and more seals as a result of a pronounced seasonal cycle of annual ice. Polar bears in northern areas responded to the more constant ice conditions and less productive environment with use of shelter dens during the period with lowest seal accessibility.																	0022-2372					NOV	2000	81	4					1118	1127		10.1644/1545-1542(2000)081<1118:RBDOPB>2.0.CO;2								WOS:000165637900020						
J	Brandstatter, R; Kumar, V; Abraham, U; Gwinner, E				Brandstatter, R; Kumar, V; Abraham, U; Gwinner, E			Photoperiodic information acquired and stored in vivo is retained in vitro by a circadian oscillator, the avian pineal gland	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Endogenous circadian rhythms have been described in a wide range of organisms from prokaryotes to man. Although basic circadian mechanisms at the molecular level are genetically fixed, certain properties of circadian rhythms at the organismic level can be; modified by environmental conditions and subsequently retained for some time, even in organisms shielded from 24-hr environmental variations. To investigate the capacity of animals to acquire and store photoperiodic information, we examined activity and melatonin rhythms in house sparrows during synchronization to two different photoperiods and during subsequent prolonged darkness. Under constant environmental conditions, intact animals continued to have long feeding activity times when previously exposed to long days and short feeding activity times when previously exposed to short days. Correspondingly, significantly different durations of elevated melatonin in the plasma directly reflected the differences in night length during synchronization as well as during prolonged darkness. Additionally, we found a significant difference in the amplitude of the nocturnal melatonin signal, which also was conserved in prolonged darkness. To investigate whether the photoperiodic experience of an intact animal can be "memorized" by an isolated component of its circadian pacemaking system, we have investigated in vitro melatonin release during continuous darkness from explanted pineal glands of house sparrows after in vivo synchronization to two distinct photoperiods. Differences in the durations of elevated melatonin occurred during the first two cycles in culture and a difference in melatonin: amplitude was detectable during the first night in culture. Our data indicate that photoperiodic patterns imposed on sparrows during in vivo synchronization can be maintained as an internal representation of time within the isolated pineal gland. Hence, the pineal gland, as one of the most significant components of the songbird circadian pacemaker, not only has the capacity to autonomously produce circadian rhythms of melatonin release but also is capable of storing biologically meaningful information experienced during previous cycles.																	0027-8424					OCT 24	2000	97	22					12324	12328		10.1073/pnas.200354997								WOS:000090071000111	11005840					
J	Pratt, PD; Croft, BA				Pratt, PD; Croft, BA			Overwintering and comparative sampling of Neoseiulus fallacis (Acari : Phytoseiidae) on ornamental nursery plants	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												The predatory mite Neoseiulus fallacis (Garman) is an important biological control agent of spider mites in many agroecosystems, including ornamental nurseries. In this study, sampling methods, tendencies to overwinter among a range of plant types, and the effect of winter protective practices were assessed for N. fallacis females. Ten spider mite-infested plant species representing a range of five plant types (conifer, shade tree, evergreen shrub, deciduous shrub, herbaceous perennial) were inoculated with 100 adult female N. fallacis in late autumn. Early the following spring, N. fallacis was extracted from each plant species by either washing plant parts (leaves, branches, trunks-crowns) in 70% ethanol and filtering contents or placing plant parts into separate Berlese funnels for 5 d. The washing method extracted more N. fallacis than the funnel method. When comparing overwintering among a range of plant types, higher densities of N. fallacis were extracted from conifers > evergreen shrubs > herbaceous perennials = deciduous shrubs = shade trees. With respect to overwintering location of N. fallacis within plants, higher densities of N. fallacis were recovered on leaves than trunks-crowns; branches were intermediate. Densities of N. fallacis were positively correlated with those of their spider mite prey. Higher densities of N. fallacis were collected from plants that were held in a greenhouse versus those left unprotected or under a sheet of polyethylene plastic. Manipulating overwintering sites for the conservation of phytoseiid natural enemies is discussed.																	0046-225X					OCT	2000	29	5					1034	1040		10.1603/0046-225X-29.5.1034								WOS:000090034700021

Our study was designed to assess the use of torpor by free-ranging Australian owlet-nightjars (Aegotheles cristatus). We selected this species for study because of their relatively small body size (50 g), arthropod diet, nocturnal sedentary nature, taxonomic affiliation with Other birds for whom the use of torpor is well documented, use of cavity roosts, and because of the cold winter (mean July minimum ambient temperature [T(a)] of approximately 0 degreesC) in the study area. We tracked 12 owlet-nightjars carrying temperature-sensitive transmitters for a total of 906 bird-days (range of 15-115 d per individual). Five different individuals entered torpor on 96 d in total. Torpor bouts occurred only between May 8 and September 8, the coldest period of the year. The lowest skin temperature (T(skin)) recorded for any bird was 19.6 degreesC, and the lowest core temperature was 22.4 degreesC. Surprisingly, torpor was rarely used at night because birds usually foraged then. Instead, torpor typically began near dawn, even on cold nights. Torpor bouts beginning at dawn lasted approximately 4 h. On 36% of days when torpor was used at dawn, birds reentered torpor later in the day. Torpor was not used during the breeding season, but this period also corresponds to the warm part of the year. There were no distinct daily minimum, maximum, or mean T(a) thresholds that could be used to reliably distinguish days when dawn torpor was used from those when it was not, although torpor was commonly employed when daily minimum T(a) fell below 3.9 degreesC. Our results show that even though Australia is typically thought of as a warm continent, at least some of the avifauna use torpor as a regular means of saving energy We hypothesise that the reasons for this species' use of torpor include its ability to remain active all night foraging, either for terrestrial arthropods while walking or for flying insects taken on the tying, and/or its habit of roosting in cavities, which allows them to remain hidden in the daytime.

Mouflons express ovarian cycles significantly later than Manchega ewes (October vs. July, P < 0.001); however, they ended cycling one month later than Manchegas (April vs. March, P < 0.05). While prolactin concentrations were high when Manchega ewes started to cycle, they were at their lowest concentrations when Mouflons started cycling. Overall, mean prolactin concentrations were higher (P < 0.001) in Mouflons than Manchegas throughout most of the year. Within the limits of sampling frequency, the duration of melatonin secretion was similar in both groups during the solstice and equinox periods: however, the amplitude was lower (P < 0.01) in Mouflons than Manchegas during the solstice periods. The significant breed differences in the seasonal hormonal changes may he attributed to a genetic influence in the endocrine responses to the same photoperiodic cues.																	0926-5287					SEP-OCT	2000	40	5					421	430		10.1051/rnd:2000109								WOS:000166315500001	11140814

The critical daylength for pupal diapause induction among the three populations was between 12L:12D and 14L:10D in the larval stage. No clinal latitudinal variation in the critical daylength was found among the three populations. Most of the diapausing pupae emerged when they were continuously maintained at 20 degrees C under 12L:12D, suggesting that cold exposure (chilling) is not necessary to break the pupal diapause. Furthermore, the time required for diapause termination of the Okayama population was the longest (214 days), followed by the Ishigaki (149 days) and Kanazawa (73 days) populations at 20 degrees C (without chilling) under the 12L:12D photoperiod. These results showed no clinal latitudinal variation in diapause termination.																	0003-6862					AUG	2000	35	3					357	360		10.1303/aez.2000.357								WOS:000089075400011						
J	Weeks, AR; Hoffmann, AA				Weeks, AR; Hoffmann, AA			Competitive interactions between two pest species of earth mites, Halotydeus destructor and Penthaleus major (Acarina : Penthaleidae)	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY												Competition was investigated between two pest earth mite species, Penthaleus major Duges and Halotydeus destructor Tucker, which occur sympatrically and are major pests of southern Australian pastures and crops. Three geographically separate pasture sites within Victoria were sampled monthly. Abundance patterns were similar across sites in that there was a marked increase in numbers of H. destructor in spring. Field competition plots were set up on pasture. In the first season, H. destructor had a negative effect on P. major but not vice versa. During the summer, diapause and ensuing generation, density-dependent (intraspecific) competition was evident in P. major hut not in H. destructor. The interspecific asymmetry was switched in the following season, with P. major dominating most plots and having a negative effect on the reproductive output of H. destructor. These findings indicate that suppression or eradication of one species of earth mite from pastures may result in another species increasing in relative abundance.

J	Buck, CL; Barnes, BM				Buck, CL; Barnes, BM			Effects of ambient temperature on metabolic rate, respiratory quotient, and torpor in an arctic hibernator	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-REGULATORY INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY												Arctic ground squirrels (Spermophilus parryii) overwinter in hibernaculum conditions that are substantially below freezing. During torpor, captive arctic ground squirrels displayed ambient temperature (T-a)-dependent patterns of core body temperature (T-b), metabolic rate (TMR), and metabolic fuel use, as determined by respiratory quotient (RQ). At T-a 0 to -16 degrees C. T-b remained relatively constant, and TMR rose proportionally with the expanding gradient between T-b and T-a, increasing > 15-fold from a minimum of 0.0115 +/- 0.0012 ml O-2 . g(-1) . h(-1). At T-a 0-20 degrees C, T-b increased with T-a; however, TMR did not change significantly from T-b 0 to 12 degrees C, indicating temperature-independent inhibition of metabolic rate. The overall change in TMR from T-b 4 to 20 degrees equates to a Q(10) of 2.4, but within this range of T-b, Q(10) changed from 1.0 to 14.1. During steady-state torpor at T-a 4 and 8 degrees C, RQ averaged 0.70 +/- 0.013, indicating exclusive lipid catabolism. At T-a -16 and 20 degrees C, RQ increased significantly to >0.85, consistent with recruitment of nonlipid fuels. RQ was negatively correlated with maximum torpor bout length. For T-a values >0 degrees C, this relationship supports the hypothesis that availability of nonlipid metabolic fuels limits torpor duration in hibernating mammals; for T-a values >0 degrees C, hypotheses linked to body temperature are supported. Because anterior body temperatures differ from core, overall, the duration torpor can be extended in hibernating mammals may be dependent on brain temperature.																	0363-6119					JUL	2000	279	1					R255	R262										WOS:000088171400033	10896889					
J	Wang, Q; Millar, JG				Wang, Q; Millar, JG			Mating behavior and evidence for male-produced sex pheromones in Leptoglossus clypealis (Heteroptera : Coreidae)	ANNALS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												Mating behavior of the leaffooted but Leptoglossus clypcalis Heidemann was studied in the laboratory (27 +/- 1 degrees C, 60 +/- 10% RH, photoperiod 16:8 [L:D] h). The mean premating period was 16.42 +/- 0.42, d (mean +/- SE). Males initiated courtship displays to females 8.13 +/- 0.12 d after emergence. Paired adults mated 17.63 +/- 2.02 times during their lifespan. The mean copulation duration was 3.85 +/- 0.49 h. Copulations occurred throughout the day, but the majority (55%) took place during the 8 h scotophase. Mating behavior began with a male attracting a female from a distance, followed by the male approaching and. courting the female at close range. Observations of mating behavior and bioassays indicated that the male produces a pheromone blend with both sex attractant and aphrodisiac functions. The male abdominal stretching behavior (stretching the ninth and part of the eighth abdominal segments frequently, and stroking them with the hind legs) during calling and courtship may aid in release and dispersal of male sex pheromone from the ses-specific ventral abdominal gland.																	0013-8746					JUL	2000	93	4					972	976		10.1603/0013-8746(2000)093[0972:MBAEFM]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000089632100032						
J	Ishihara, M				Ishihara, M			Effect of variation in photoperiodic response on diapause induction and developmental time in the willow leaf beetle, Plagiodera versicolora	ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA												The willow leaf beetle, Plagiodera versicolora (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) overwinters in adult diapause. In this study, the photoperiodic responses for diapause induction and developmental time were examined in the Ishikari (Hokkaido, Japan) population of P. versicolora. All females entered reproductive diapause under short daylength (L10:D14), but 31.7% of females did not enter diapause under long daylength (L16:D8). The developmental time from oviposition to adult emergence was significantly longer at L10:D14 than that at L16:D8. Norm of reaction curves illustrated variation among families in the photoperiodic responses for diapause induction and for developmental time. ANOVA indicated significant family x photoperiod interactions in the developmental time. At L16:D8, developmental time was positively correlated with the incidence of diapause in females. This means that a female having a longer developmental time tends to have a longer critical photoperiod. Such variation may be maintained by differences in selection pressures on the growth rate and the critical photoperiod for diapause induction between univoltine and bivoltine genotypes because Ishikari is located in a transitional area between populations with univoltine and bivoltine life cycles.																	0013-8703	1570-7458				JUL	2000	96	1					27	32		10.1046/j.1570-7458.2000.00675.x								WOS:000087808200003

The emerging resistance during encystation to short-term exposure to the minimum amoebicidal concentrations of each biocide tested was recorded during the first 36 h of the differentiation process. Hydrochloric acid and moist heat were tested as possible resistance markers. Development of the acid-insoluble, protein-containing, ectocyst wall and the cellulase endocyst wall was followed by quantification of the acid- and alkali-insoluble residues of cell samples removed from synchronous encystment cultures up to 36 h. Resistance to chemical agents (polyhexamethylene biguanide, benzalkonium chloride, propamidine isethionate, pentamidine isethionate, dibromopropamidine isethionate, hydrogen peroxide) and to moist heat was seen to develop between 14 and 24 h after trophozoites were inoculated into the encystment media. Resistance to hydrochloric acid developed between 0 and 2 h and to chlorhexidine diacetate between 24 and 36 h. Levels of acid-insoluble residues began to increase after 8 h and alkali-insoluble residues (cellulose) were detected after 16 h and coincided with the emergence of resistance to all the agents tested except hydrochloric acid. The results suggest that resistance to the biocides tested probably results largely from the physical barrier of the cyst walls rather than as a consequence of a metabolically dormant cyst.																	0305-7453					JUL	2000	46	1					27	34		10.1093/jac/46.1.27								WOS:000089125100005	10882685

Using morpho-agronomical and passport data	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS												A large collection, such as the sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] landrace collection held at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), represents a challenge for the maintenance of both the accessions of and the information documented for the germplasm collection. The accessibility and knowledge of the landrace collection are the essential factors for an efficient utilization of the genetic resources by both breeders and farmers. Different sampling strategies, either random or non-random, were proposed to obtain subsets of reduced size (core collection). Three subsets were established; a random sampling within a stratified collection (logarithmic strategy: L); a sample based upon morpho-agronomic diversity (principal component score strategy: PCS); and a sample based upon an empirical knowledge of sorghum (taxonomic strategy: T). Comparisons of these three samples for morpho-agronomic characterization and passport information were assessed to determine their impact on phenotypic diversity. For their overall diversity, the three subsets did not differ, as shown with the two-dimensional representation of the morpho-agronomic diversity and the Shannon-Weaver diversity indices. When comparisons for morpho-agronomic and passport data were considered, the PCS subset looked similar to the the landrace collection. The L subset showed differences fur characters associated with the photoperiod reaction that was considered in the stratification of the collection. The T subset was the most distinct from the entire landrace collection as it overrepresented the landraces selected by farmers for specific uses and covered the widest range of geographical adaptation and morpho-agronomic characteristics.

J	Menu, F; Roebuck, JP; Viala, M				Menu, F; Roebuck, JP; Viala, M			Bet-hedging diapause strategies in stochastic environments	AMERICAN NATURALIST												In many insect species, adult emergence spreads over several years because of the existence of prolonged diapause in certain individuals. From stochastic models, we show that diversified bethedging strategies (mixed strategies with emergence after 1 or 2 yr) are more fit than simple diapause strategy (emergence after 1 yr) or fixed prolonged diapause strategy (emergence after 2 yr) in isolated chestnut weevil populations. This conclusion applies to a large range of survival rates in prolonged diapause and is insensitive;to initial conditions, magnitude of temporal autocorrelation, distribution of demographic parameters, and quoted values of population size limitation. However, the shape of the fitness distribution as a function of prolonged diapause frequency changes greatly in the absence of population size limitation. Whatever the survival rate during prolonged diapause, we find that there is no genotypic advantage to extending diapause for all chestnut weevil larvae to more than 1 yr. Our models predict selection of bet-hedging strategies over a large range of prolonged diapause frequencies. This result is consistent with the existence of several mixed strategies in a population. Emergences after 3 yr are not crucial for selection or for the dynamics of mixed strategies in the chestnut weevil.

Non-diapause adults from the carnea biotype varied significantly in only one aspect of reproduction, viz., the preoviposition period, whereas the duration and rate of oviposition, as well as fecundity, did not vary significantly. Relative to the carnea populations, the mohave population typically had delayed oviposition and a lower rate of oviposition; however, its oviposition period was long, and thus its fecundity differed only from that of the most productive carnea populations. The shelf-life (= survival during storage, and subsequent survival and reproduction after storage) was evaluated for four populations of the carnea biotype. Survival of diapausing adults during the first 18 weeks of storage was high among all four populations; adults from three populations also showed high survival after 35 weeks of storage. A high incidence of females from all four populations laid some fertile eggs after being stored for up to 31 weeks or longer. After six or more weeks of storage, average fecundity was high and ranged from similar to 400-900 eggs/female. Duration of storage (up to 39 weeks) was a significant determinant of fecundity in two of the four populations. In practice, diverse populations of C. carnea can be efficiently mass-produced (with or without storage) under uniform conditions in the insectary. Thus, the choice of which populations to mass-produce and use in augmentation can be based primarily on the characteristics (e.g., climate, habitat, crop) of the intended area of release, rather than on considerations concerning mass-rearing.																	0013-8703					JUN	2000	95	3					293	302		10.1046/j.1570-7458.2000.00668.x								WOS:000087169200008						
J	Quesada-Moraga, E; Santiago-Alvarez, C				Quesada-Moraga, E; Santiago-Alvarez, C			Temperature related effects on embryonic development of the Mediterranean locust, Dociostaurus maroccanus	PHYSIOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												Laboratory studies were conducted to assess the effect of temperature on the development of the eggs of Dociostaurus maroccanus (Thunberg) (Orthoptera, Acrididae) during anatrepsis (stages I-XIV) and during catatrepsis (stages XV-XX). The developmental rates of anatrepsis were studied at five constant temperatures ranging from 10 to 30 degrees C. Egg development occurred over the entire range but at 10 degrees C the embryos were unable to complete anatrepsis. The relationship between temperature and developmental times for completing anatrepsis was analysed by the non-linear Logan type III model. The optimal temperature estimated for the development of eggs during anatrepsis was 24.7 degrees C; the lower and upper thermal thresholds were 9 degrees C and 31 degrees C, respectively. Once the embryos completed anatrepsis, only those incubated at 15 degrees C continued morphogenesis beyond stage XIV (diapause stage) without a low-temperature exposure period. The developmental rate of catatrepsis was studied at four constant temperatures ranging from 15 degrees C to 30 degrees C after exposure to low-temperature, 10 degrees C, for 30, 60 or 90 days. For catatrepsis, temperature and developmental time were linearly and inversely related. Linear regression was used to estimate the lower developmental threshold and the degree days requirements for catatrepsis. Both decreased with longer exposure to the low temperature; the former from 13.8 degrees C to 10.5 degrees C and the latter from 212.8 to 171.5 degree days, following 30 and 90 days at 10 degrees C, respectively. Our results improve the ability of decision support systems for Mediterranean locust pest management by providing better forecasts to land managers and pest advisors.

The development process was divided into different phases based on a distinct events observed during L1 development: hatching of L1, construction of hibernacula, excretion of green pellets, and molt. The green substance in newly hatched L1 was found to be proteinaceous. The proportion of L1 that successfully completed development at various temperatures indicated that the optimal temperature range for L1 development was between 18 and 27 degrees C. Larval mortality, particularly at low temperatures, occurred mainly before construction of hibernacula and excretion of green pellets. Low temperatures had a weak effect on development time from larval hatching to construction of hibernacula, but the duration of subsequent development periods were substantially increased under these temperatures. Temperature threshold (TT approximate to 6 degrees C), degree-day requirement (DD approximate to 87), and other developmental parameters were estimated.																	0013-8746					MAY	2000	93	3					536	540		10.1603/0013-8746(2000)093[0536:DOTFIS]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000089631900027						
J	Bradshaw, WE; Fujiyama, S; Holzapfel, CM				Bradshaw, WE; Fujiyama, S; Holzapfel, CM			Adaptation to the thermal climate of North America by the pitcher-plant mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii	ECOLOGY												We are concerned with the climatic factors that affect the adaptive radiation of species into and within the temperate zone. As one progresses northward, there is a decrease in summer temperatures and a concomitant increase in the duration and intensity of winter cold. For the pitcher-plant mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii, it has been shown previously that (1) range expansion and evolution has proceeded from south to north, and (2) either realistically hot summer temperatures or a simulated 7-mo winter reduce fitness by 60% or more in two New Jersey (40 degrees N) populations. Herein, we compare the relative fitness of nine populations of W. smithii from 30 degrees to 50 degrees N when exposed to these same stressful summer temperatures and simulated winter. We determined the survivorship, fecundity, and fertility of five cohorts from each population at each temperature in both environments, and we calculated the cohort replacement rate (R(0)) as the product of these three component traits. Survivorship declined with increasing latitude in the summer, but not the winter, environment. Fecundity was not correlated with latitude in either environment. Fertility declined with increasing latitude in both environments. R(0) was not correlated with latitude in either environment. Hence, the interpretation of the adaptive responses to climate can depend critically on the trait being examined. Because R(0) is a composite index of fitness that includes any trade-offs among its constituent traits, we place greater reliance on its noncorrelation with latitude. Therefore, we conclude that, despite their clear impact on fitness, summer heat and winter cold have had little impact on the adaptive evolution of W. smithii to the climatic gradient of North America. The decline in summer heat and increase in the duration and intensity of winter cold as one moves north also impose a latitudinal gradient in the length of the favorable growing season. Many plants and animals use daylength to cue the seasonal events in their life cycles. We then argue that the timing of seasonal development mediated by photoperiodic response constitutes the most immediate adaptation of populations to novel temperate climates, and that adaptation of thermal responsiveness to summer heat or winter cold takes place over a longer time scale or taxonomic distance.																	0012-9658					MAY	2000	81	5					1262	1272										WOS:000086795100007						
J	Mitchell, SE; Lampert, W				Mitchell, SE; Lampert, W			Temperature adaptation in a geographically widespread zooplankter, Daphnia magna	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY												Evidence for temperature adaptation in Daphnia magna was inferred from variation in the shape of temperature reaction norms for somatic growth rate, a fitness-related trait. Ex-ephippial clones from eight populations across Europe were grown under standardized conditions after preacclimation at five temperatures (17-29 degrees C). Significant variation for grand mean growth rates occurred both within populations (among clones) and between populations. Genetic variation for reaction norm shape was found within populations, with temperature-dependent trade-offs in clone relative fitness. However, the population average responses to temperature were similar, following approximately parallel reaction norms. The among-population variation is not evidence for temperature adaptation. Lack of temperature adaptation at the population level may be a feature of intermittent populations where environmentally terminated diapause can entrain the planktonic stage of the life-history within a similar range of temperatures.																	1010-061X	1420-9101				MAY	2000	13	3					371	382										WOS:000087030000002						
J	Irwin, JT; Lee, RE				Irwin, JT; Lee, RE			Mild winter temperatures reduce survival and potential fecundity of the goldenrod gall fly, Eurosta solidaginis (Diptera : Tephritidae)	JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY												We tested the hypothesis that mild winter temperatures are detrimental to the survival and reproductive potential of insects. We measured survival, body size, and potential fecundity of a freeze tolerant insect, the goldenrod gall fly (Eurosta solidaginis), after overwintering in the laboratory for similar to 3 mo, frozen at -22 degrees C, unfrozen at 0 degrees C, or unfrozen at 12 degrees C. Larvae held at 12 degrees C suffered high mortality (70%) and relatively low potential fecundity as adults (mean+/-SEM=199+/-11 eggs/female), while those held at 0 degrees C had both low mortality (11%) and high potential fecundity (256+/-15 eggs/female). Freezing (-22 degrees C) increased mortality (30% overall) but did not significantly reduce fecundity (245+/-13 eggs/female). Egg length and width were constant regardless of treatment group or female body size. Analysis of covariance indicated that reduced fecundity in the 12 degrees C group was related to reduced larval body weight following treatment. Patterns of larval weight loss in the experimental treatments were generally correlated with previous reports of latitudinal trends in weight loss through the winter. We conclude that mild winter temperatures may be detrimental to some overwintering insects, particularly species that do not feed following winter diapause. Low temperature and even freezing are beneficial, allowing conservation of energy reserves to maintain high survival and potential fecundity. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Nunes, MV; Hardie, J				Nunes, MV; Hardie, J			The effect of temperature on the photoperiodic 'clock' and 'counter' of a Scottish clone of the vetch aphid, Megoura viciae	JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY												Photoperiodic response curves were determined for a Scottish clone of the vetch aphid, Megoura viciae Buckton, at three temperatures: 12.5, 15, and 17.5 degrees C. Critical night lengths (CNLs) for ovipara (sexual female) induction were 6 h, 7 h and 8 h, respectively. High incidences of ovipara production were observed in all night lengths longer than the CNL including continuous darkness (DD), as well as in continuous light (LL) at 12.5 and 15 degrees C. At the same three temperatures, the number of long- or short-night cycles required for half of the experimental aphids to be ovipara producers (i.e. the required day number, RDN) was determined. The RDN for long-night cycles (LD12:12) could not be determined at 12.5 degrees C, but was temperature compensated between 15 and 17.5 degrees C. The RDN for short-night cycles (LD20:4) could not be determined at any temperature. However, as induction of oviparae was always 100% in 12.5 degrees C, 94-100% in 15 degrees C and dropped from 100% to between 47 and 71% in 17.5 degrees C, it seems that short-night accumulation was temperature dependent. When fourth-stadium larvae were transferred from LD20:4 at 20 degrees C to the same light-dark cycle at 15 degrees C, the aphids, when adult, switched to the production of oviparae after about 4 weeks. First-born progeny kept in LD20:4 and 15 degrees C switched to the production of oviparae about 7 days after the moult to adult. Thus, the photoperiodic response can be directly affected by temperature, irrespective of photoperiod. Model-generated response curves using the 'double circadian oscillator model' for photoperiodic time measurement (Vaz Nunes, M., 1998. A double circadian oscillator model for quantitative photoperiodic time measurement in insects and mites. Journal of Theoretical Biology 194, 299-311) closely resembled the observations. Differences between these data and the results of previous experiments with an English clone of M. viciae could be accounted for by differences in the photoperiodic clocks (damping rate and period) as well as the photoperiodic counters.

J	Trillmich, F				Trillmich, F			Effects of low temperature and photoperiod on reproduction in the female wild guinea pig (Cavia aperea)	JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY												Small mammals in the tropics and subtropics usually rely opportunistically on favorable environmental conditions for breeding rather than base their breeding decision on prediction from photoperiodic cues as most high-latitude species do. Species producing precocial young may be more likely to reproduce aseasonally than species with altricial young. For female wild guinea pigs (Cavia aperea) from Argentina (35 degrees S) that produce extremely precocial young, these hypotheses would predict moderate responsiveness of female reproduction to photoperiod. These predictions were tested in a series of laboratory experiments. Guinea pigs reproduced aseasonally when kept under natural photoperiod and temperatures at Bielefeld (52 degrees 01'N, 8 degrees 32'E). When given short days (9L:15D) and long days (14L:10D) under indoor temperature conditions (20-23 degrees C), no effect of photoperiod on female reproduction was noted. A shift from long day length (14L:10D) to short day length (9L:15D) did not stop reproduction. Increasing energy expenditure for thermoregulation at low temperature (5 degrees C) under long-day (14L:10D) conditions also did not inhibit reproduction.

In a field survey (Kato, 1999), it was found that individuals with different fringe color of the forewing (brown or yellow type) inhabit Okinawa-jima Island located in north of the subtropical region, and that fringe-color is linked with seasonal morph expression. In the present study, rearing experiments were done to investigate whether these sympatric individuals are different forms within one species or belong to different species. The results show that each population of brown- and yellow-types maintained its own seasonal morph response to photoperiod and temperature through three generations. Host-plant utilization by the larvae and the fringe-color also differed between them and was maintained. These findings strongly suggest that E. hecabe of Okinawa-jima Island is divided into two distinct populations, and that one belongs to the temperate and the other to the subtropical group.																	0289-0003					MAY	2000	17	4					539	547		10.2108/0289-0003(2000)17[539:ODOTGO]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000088164700017						
J	Anella, LB; Whitlow, TH				Anella, LB; Whitlow, TH			Photosynthetic response to flooding of Acer rubrum seedlings from wet and dry sites	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												Seeds were collected from three red maple swamps (wet sites) and three uplands (dry sites) near Ithaca, New York, and the resulting seedlings were used in flood tolerance studies to investigate if red maple's broad habitat range is due to ecotypic differentiation. One-year-old seedlings were flooded while still dormant (spring flooding study) and net photosynthesis, growth and chlorophyll levels vi-ere measured at 1 mo intervals for 3 mo. Flooding reduced net photosynthesis, growth and chlorophyll levels in seedlings from both sites, but survival of both wet and dry site seedlings was near 100%. After 1 mo of flooding net photosynthesis of wet and dry site seedlings were similar, but after 3 mo, flooded wet site seedlings had higher photosynthetic rates than did dry site seedlings. Control wet rite seedlings were significantly larger than dry site seedlings and had significantly higher photosynthetic rates and chlorophyll levels. These differences suggest either genetic variation between seedlings from the two habitats in response to the growing conditions or the influence of seed size differences and confound the spring flooding study results. Flooded wet site seedlings had higher, final, net photosynthetic rates than did dry site seedlings, but the response to flooding was greater for wet site seedlings than it was for dry site seedlings. In a second study (summer flooding study), 1-y-old seedlings in full leaf were flooded for 22 d and then drained to determine if recovery from flooding stress differed for wet and dry site seedlings. Again, flooding decreased net photosynthesis for seedlings from both habitats but, when the trees were drained, net photosynthesis for wet site seedlings recovered more quickly and to a higher level than it did for dry site seedlings. Flooding also caused a drop in chlorophyll level for seedlings from both habitats, but chlorophyll levels of seedlings from neither habitat recovered when the seedlings were drained. There were no significant differences between wet site and dry site control seedlings for net photosynthesis; therefore, the quicker and larger recovery of photosynthetic potential in wet site seedlings in the summer flooding study suggests that ecotypic differentiation has occurred and that genetic differences, in part, account for red maple's occurrence on contrasting edaphic sites.																	0003-0031					APR	2000	143	2					330	341		10.1674/0003-0031(2000)143[0330:PRTFOA]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000086254100005

Blood samples from all birds belonging to the control, sham-control (administered only with the vehicle of hormone, i.e., ethanol-saline 1:9 v/v), and melatonin treated groups were collected at four time points, i.e. 06.00 h, 12.00 h, 18.00 h, and 24.00 h, in a 24 hour cycle. The blood glucose levels in control and sham-control birds showed marked variation with regard to the time of sampling, with a mid-day peak and morning nadir. Exogenous melatonin induced a significant alteration in this diurnal pattern of blood glucose with a marked variation in relation to the time of administration of melatonin. While morning administration of melatonin resulted in hypoglycemia at 12.00 h and 24.00 h and hyperglycemia at 18.00 h, the response to evening injection of melatonin was only hypoglycemic at 24.00 h leaving the glycemic values at other time-points almost unaltered compared to the blood glucose levels in control and sham-control munias. The results of this investigation demonstrate for the first time that a schedule of morning administration of melatonin induces a more broad range of variations in the blood glucose levels than a schedule of evening administration does.																	0929-1016					APR	2000	31	2					220	229										WOS:000086644200008						
J	Moriuchi, KS; Venable, DL; Pake, CE; Lange, T				Moriuchi, KS; Venable, DL; Pake, CE; Lange, T			Direct measurement of the seed bank age structure of a Sonoran Desert annual plant	ECOLOGY												We describe a new approach to determining the age structure of seed banks of natural plant populations and apply it to a natural population of the Sonoran Desert winter annual, Pectocarya recurvata (Boraginaceae). Unlike other C-14 techniques, tandem accelerator mass spectrometry (TAMS) counts the number of carbon isotope atoms, permitting high precision with small samples. Aboveground nuclear bomb tests caused atmospheric C-14 levels to peak in 1963. Their subsequent gradual decline provides a signal for aging seed banks with TAMS. We constructed a calibration curve using seeds with known dates of production during 1980-1995, then used it to age 53 seeds sampled from a natural seed bank in 1993, at the Desert Laboratory in Tucson, Arizona. Seed number declined with age at an approximately exponential rate, with the oldest recovered seed having an estimated age of 5 yr (95% cr = +/-2.3 yr). The seed bank age structure was judged more than adequate to buffer this population from typical fluctuations, based on an examination of 15 yr of population dynamic data. The TAMS technique has strong potential for answering a broad range of ecological and evolutionary questions requiring post-1963 age determinations and for which a several-year confidence interval is acceptable.																	0012-9658					APR	2000	81	4					1133	1138		10.2307/177184								WOS:000086351500022						
J	Lam, WKF; Pedigo, LP				Lam, WKF; Pedigo, LP			Cold tolerance of overwintering bean leaf beetles (Coleoptera : Chrysomelidae)	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												Laboratory studies were conducted during the winters of 1996 and 1997 to determine the cold tolerance of overwintering adult bean leaf beetles, Cerotoma trifurcata (Forster). Second-generation adults were collected during early September from soybean fields near Ames, IA. The collected beetles were reared at eec with a photoperiod of 10:14 (L:D) h in the laboratory for 3 wk. The beetles were transferred to a chamber with high relative humidity at 5 degrees C and photoperiod of 9:15 (L:D) h for evacuation of gut contents dangling. After 2 wk at 5 degrees C, the beetles were selected randomly and subjected to cold baths maintained at temperatures, including -15, -10, -5, 0, and 5 degrees C. At certain time intervals, beetles were retrieved from the cold baths for the observation of mortality. More than 50% of the adult beetles survived over hundreds of hours at -5, 0, and 5 degrees C, whereas most of the beetles died after 15 min at -10 and -15 degrees C. The results indicated that the critical temperature range causing significant mortality of the overwintering beetles would be between -5 and -10 degrees C. Moreover, during the two-winter study the daily leaf litter mean temperature recorded in woodland mainly stayed at above -5 degrees C. The results showed that hibernating in the leaf litter of woodland allowed the beetles to avoid extreme temperature fluctuations during winter.																	0046-225X					APR	2000	29	2					157	163		10.1603/0046-225X(2000)029[0157:CTOOBL]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000089623200004						
J	Kostal, V; Shimada, K; Hayakawa, Y				Kostal, V; Shimada, K; Hayakawa, Y			Induction and development of winter larval diapause in a drosophilid fly, Chymomyza costata	JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY												Photoperiodic response during induction of larval hibernal diapause of Chymomyza costata was characterized and the course of diapause development was analyzed in the laboratory. C. costata becomes sensitive to photoperiodic stimuli during an unspecified stage of its early development (embryo, Ist larval instar); the sensitivity gradually increases during the 2nd and early 3rd larval instars and reaches its maximum just before the moment when it abruptly ceases at the age of 15-19 days after oviposition. Diapause intensifies during a period of 2-3 weeks after induction and, later, is maintained without apparent development until death (between 150 and 250 days) under 18 degrees C and a short-day photoperiod (L10:D14, SD). Diapause may be terminated in a horotelic process by exposure to a low temperature (2 degrees C) during which larvae subsequently (1) synchronize their post-diapause development (requires up to 14 days of chilling), (2) lose photoperiodic sensitivity (2 months), and finally (3) terminate diapause (5 months). Alternatively, diapause may be terminated in a tachytelic process by exposure to a high temperature (18 degrees C) and long-day photoperiod (L16:D8, LD) during which no synchronization occurs and pupariation takes place after a mean of 25.2 days (with a broad range from 8 to more than 50 days). Larvae that are transferred from LD to SD during their sensitive period switch their developmental programming from pupariation to diapause. Proliferation of adult primordial structures (imaginal discs, neuroblasts) slows down within 1 day after transfer. In contrast, whole body growth continues for at least 3 days before its rate slows down and matches the rate characteristic for SD conditions. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Saunders, DS				Saunders, DS			Larval diapause duration and fat metabolism in three geographical strains of the blow fly, Calliphora vicina	JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY												Diapausing larvae of the blow fly, Calliphora vicina, from three geographical strains exposed, as adults, to short days, were maintained under identical conditions (darkness, 11-12 degrees C) and examined for changes in wet weight, dry weight, water and fat content during diapause development to the emergence of post-diapause adults. Larvae produced by flies originating from northern Finland (Nallikari, 65 degrees N) showed a longer, more intense, diapause than those from localities further south (Edinburgh, Scotland, 55 degrees N and Barga, Italy, 44 degrees N), but all three strains showed similar rates of loss of the parameters measured. This was also the case for post-diapause adults, flies of the Barga strain with its relatively short diapause emerging with greater residual fat reserves than flies from the Edinburgh or Nallikari strains with their more protracted diapause. It was concluded that the rates of water and fat loss were functions of the conditions used for diapause larval maintenance (probably temperature) rather than the maternally programmed degree of diapause incidence, or of its 'depth' or 'intensity'.

J	Lambrechts, MM; Perret, P				Lambrechts, MM; Perret, P			A long photoperiod overrides non-photoperiodic factors in blue tits' timing of reproduction	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Endocrinological studies have contributed considerably to the development of theory concerning the proximate aspects of the timing of reproduction. In non-domesticated, avian species, the relative importance of the photoperiodic and non-photoperiodic factors influencing later stages of the breeding cycle, such as the onset of egg laying, remains unclear because egg laying is difficult to obtain with captive populations and laboratory experiments of breeding are rarely carried out in the framework of long-term field studies. We set up a special experimental design such that captive Mediterranean blue tits (Parus caeruleus) can breed with success in large outdoor aviaries at similar latitudes and altitudes to their wild counterparts. Here we demonstrate experimentally that the non-photoperiodic factors responsible for large and consistent differences in the expression of natural breeding responses between three captive outdoor blue tit populations are ignored during long-day treatment. Based on these findings, an evolutionary explanation is provided for why the relative importance of the non-photoperiodic factors decreases with the progress of the season. The hypothesis can explain observed maladapted breeding dates in free-living populations and could possibly be used to increase the success of breeding programmes with some endangered, captive, non-domesticated, photoperiodic species.																	0962-8452					MAR 22	2000	267	1443					585	588		10.1098/rspb.2000.1041								WOS:000086140900010	10787162

Studies were conducted at constant temperatures across a range from 14-30 degrees C and with a 16L:8D photoperiod. During a preliminary trial with a 12L:12D photoperiod, diapause was induced at 14 degrees C. The thermal requirements for the egg to mummy, mummy to adult and egg to adult development periods were estimated respectively as t = 6.59, 8.03 and 7.53 degrees C, and K = 96.71, 111.12 and 212.77 degree-days. The upper developmental threshold was considered to be above 30 degrees C because development did not cease and was not prolonged at this temperature.																	1021-3589					MAR	2000	8	1					75	79										WOS:000088828700008						
J	Pophof, B				Pophof, B			Octopamine modulates the sensitivity of silkmoth pheromone receptor neurons	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY A-SENSORY NEURAL AND BEHAVIORAL PHYSIOLOGY												Effects of octopamine and its antagonist epinastine on electrophysiological responses of receptor neurons of Antheraea polyphemus specialised to the pheromone components (E,Z)-6,11-hexadecadienyl acetate and (E,Z)-6,11-hexadecadienal were investigated. Injections of octopamine and epinastine into the moths had no effect on the transepithelial potential of the antennal-branch preparation nor on the spontaneous nerve impulse frequency in either type of receptor neuron. However, in the presence of continuous low-intensity pheromone stimulation, octopamine significantly increased the nerve impulse frequency in the acetate receptor neuron, but not in the aldehyde receptor neuron. Octopamine and epinastine had no significant effect on the receptor potential amplitudes elicited in both receptor neuron types by pheromone stimulation. However, the peak nerve impulse frequency in the response of both receptor neuron types to pheromone was significantly affected: decreased by epinastine and increased by octopamine over a broad range of pheromone concentrations. In control experiments, injection of physiological saline did not significantly alter the peak nerve impulse frequency. The effect of octopamine was established within Ih after injection and persisted for about 4 h. The possibility of a direct action of octopamine on the nerve impulse generation by the receptor neurons is discussed.

J	Cepeda-Palacios, R; Scholl, PJ				Cepeda-Palacios, R; Scholl, PJ			Intra-puparial development in Oestrus ovis (Diptera : Oestridae)	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY												The phenology of intrapuparial development in Oestrus ovis L. is described, based on 302 specimens collected from the head cavities of goats and reared in the laboratory at a photoperiod of 12:12 (L:D) h and 32 and 16 degrees C. Dissection and histology of puparia at pupariation and at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 66, and 72 h after pupariation and every day of the intra-puparial period showed that pupariation was achieved in approximate to 12 h in heavily pigmented larvae (range, 2-46 h in postfeeding period). Larval-pupal apolysis began immediately after pupariation and was completed by 18-36 h after pupariation (prepupal period). The cryptocephalic pupa was found from this time to the 5th d, when head eversion occurred. Pupal-adult apolysis was initiated before head eversion and completed by day 7. The pharate adult presented progressive coloration in compound eyes (transparent, white, yellow, orange, red, brown, silver) while integumental pigmentation and sclerotization were in progress. Adult emergence occurred at 22 and 23 d in males and females, respectively. Changes in the weekly puparial weight of specimens reared under both field and laboratory conditions was described. It was concluded that although the intra-puparial development of O. ovis displayed some unique characteristics, it was essentially similar to other cyclorraphous flies. The actual pupal period of O. ovis lasted from the 2-7 d postpupariation, whereas approximately two-thirds of the intrapuparial period was used for the maturation of the pharate adult.																	0022-2585					MAR	2000	37	2					239	245		10.1603/0022-2585-37.2.239								WOS:000089625000009	10730494

The insect displayed a preference for Baccharis ill the field, with 76% of adults and nymphs found on Baccharis, 15% of asteraceous plants, and 9% oil plants outside the tribe. in 1993; similar patterns were observed in 1997. When ovipositing in dichotomous choice experiments, O. mimulus females laid 81% of their eggs in Baccharis inflorescences and 19% in non-Baccharis inflorescences. Adult O. mimulus populations on 2 to 6 year-old Baccharis were estimated to range from 64 to 165 individuals during the mating season. A significant interaction (P = 0.017) occurs between the effects of photoperiod and food availability on O. mimulus oviposition, with the most eggs being laid tinder short photoperiod and in the presence of seeds. We believe that Baccharis is the principal host of O. mimulus, and that the insect's phenology is closely tied to that of the plant such that it maximizes its access to good quality Baccharis seeds and ovules.
