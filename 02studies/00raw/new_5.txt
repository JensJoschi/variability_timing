J	Ito, K; Nakata, T				Ito, K; Nakata, T			Geographical variation of photoperiodic response in the females of a predatory bug, Orius sauteri (Poppius) (Heteroptera : Anthocoridae) from northern Japan	APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY												The critical photoperiod for short-day induced diapause was examined in eight different populations of Orius sauteri collected from northern Japan (36.0 degrees N-45.4 degrees N). Five out of six populations from Hokkaido had steep long-day type photoperiodic responses, i.e., almost all females grown under 14L-10D or shorter photoregime entered reproductive diapause and as little as a 1 h transition of photoperiod around the critical photoperiod drastically changed the diapause response. The curves of the photoperiodic response were relatively gentle in the most southern population of the Hokkaido and two northern Honshu populations. In particular, some females of the Tsukuba population (36.0 degrees N) even laid eggs under such short daylengths as 11L-13D or 12L-12D. The critical photoperiod was longer in the populations from higher latitudes and shorter in those from lower latitudes, i.e., a clinal relationship was observed. The benefit of introduction of the southern populations to Hokkaido was discussed from the viewpoint of diapause. The advantages of the use of non-diapause strains selected from southern populations such as the Tsukuba population were also considered.																	0003-6862					FEB	2000	35	1					101	105		10.1303/aez.2000.101								WOS:000085732500016						
J	Jacobs, JD; Wingfield, JC				Jacobs, JD; Wingfield, JC			Endocrine control of life-cycle stages: A constraint on response to the environment?	CONDOR					Meeting of the North-American-Ornithological-Societies	APR, 1998	ST LOUIS, MO	N Amer Ornithol Soc				Most organisms live in seasonal environments that fluctuate on a predictable schedule and sometimes unpredictably. Individuals must, therefore, adjust so as to maximize their survival and reproductive success over a wide range of environmental conditions. In birds, as in other vertebrates, endocrine secretions regulate morphological, physiological, and behavioral changes in anticipation of future events. The individual thus prepares for predictable fluctuations in its environment by changing life-cycle stages. We have applied finite-stale machine theory to define and compare different life-history cycles. The ability of birds to respond to predictable and unpredictable regimes of environmental variation may be constrained by the adaptability of their endocrine control systems. We have applied several theoretical approaches to natural history data of birds to compare the complexity of life cycles, the degree of plasticity of timing of stages within the cycle, and to determine whether endocrine control mechanisms influence the way birds respond to their environments. The interactions of environmental cues on the timing of life-history stages are not uniform in all populations. Taking the reproductive life-history stage as an example, arctic birds that have short breeding seasons in severe environments appear to use one reliable environmental cue to time reproduction and they ignore other factors. Birds having longer breeding seasons exhibit greater plasticity of onset and termination and appear to integrate several environmental cues. Theoretical approaches may allow us to predict how individuals respond to their environment at the proximate level and, conversely, predict how constraints imposed by endocrine control systems may limit the complexity of life cycles.																	0010-5422					FEB	2000	102	1					35	51		10.1650/0010-5422(2000)102[0035:ECOLCS]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000085195300005

Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis revealed that two QTL, one on chromosome 3, designated Hd6, and another on chromosome 2, designated Hd7 were involved in this variation; and Hd6 was precisely mapped as a single Mendelian factor by using progeny testing (BC4F8). The nearly isogenic line with QTL (QTL-NIL) that carries the chromosomal segment from Kasalath for the Hd6 region in Nipponhare's genetic background was developed by marker-assisted selection. In a day-length treatment test, the QTL-NIL for Hd6 prominently increased days to heading under a 13.5-hr day length compared with the recurrent parent, Nipponbare, suggesting that Hd6 controls photoperiod sensitivity. QTL analysis of the F-2 population derived from a cross between the QTL-NILs revealed existence of an epistatic interaction between Hd2, which is one of the photoperiod sensitivity genes detected in a previous analysis, and Hd6. The day-length treatment tests of these QTL-NILs, including the line introgressing both Hd2 and Hd6, also indicated an epistatic interaction for photoperiod sensitivity between them.																	0016-6731					FEB	2000	154	2					885	891										WOS:000085178700034	10655238

JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY A-SENSORY NEURAL AND BEHAVIORAL PHYSIOLOGY												The importance of circadian timing was evaluated for 18 months from late-April 1997 through October 1998 in a high-density population of free-living eastern chipmunks, Tamias striatus, at a 4-ha forest site in the Allegheny Mountains. Included in the radio-collared field group were 30 chipmunks with suprachiasmatic nucleus-targeted lesions, 24 surgical controls, and 20 intact controls. An additional 17 chipmunks were used in a laboratory study as lesion-calibration controls to correlate degree of circadian arrhythmicity with extent of supra-chiasmatic nucleus deletion. Survival was documented in the field by daily radio tracking and by regular trapping censuses except during winter hibernation. A significantly higher proportion of suprachiasmatic nucleus-lesioned than surgical control chipmunks or intact controls were killed by weasel predation during the first 80 days after repatriation. A 28-h continuous census found no surface activity of any chipmunks during hours of darkness. However, episodes of nocturnal movement were detected within the permanent dens by radio telemetric data logging, especially in supra-chiasmatic nucleus-lesioned animals. Excavation and mapping of six chipmunk burrow systems aided in the interpretation of the telemetric activity data. Nighttime restlessness of supra-chiasmatic nucleus-lesioned animals may have acted as a clue to the predator for locating its prey.

J	Smith, SE; Riley, E; Tiss, JL; Fendenheim, DM				Smith, SE; Riley, E; Tiss, JL; Fendenheim, DM			Geographical variation in predictive seedling emergence in a perennial desert grass	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 Mechanisms that link germination and emergence to environmental cues associated with seedling success (predictive germination) would be expected to evolve when seedlings have a greater mortality risk than seeds, but may be less important in perennial plants than in annual plants. 2 We investigated variation in predictive seedling emergence among divergent populations of a short-lived perennial desert grass, Digitaria californica, from sites that differed in climatic and edaphic factors. This species is native to environments in which the amount and duration of adequate soil moisture may control germination and seedling establishment success. 3 We utilized a special irrigation system that permits application of a range of amounts of water within a single experiment in a glasshouse. Emergence data were subjected to probit and survival analyses to describe differences among the populations in response to applied water. 4 Significant variation in predictive emergence was shown to exist among populations of D. californica when measured as amount of water required for 50% emergence following 3 days of water application, or as time required to achieve this level of emergence. Both climatic and soil characteristics were important with populations that originated from sites with less summer precipitation, and soils with higher water-holding capacity tended to have lower water requirements for emergence. 5 The report demonstrates the existence of subtle variation in predictive emergence among populations of a perennial grass representing a relatively narrow range of ecological amplitude. It also establishes the usefulness of line-source irrigation and probit analysis procedures in studying seedling emergence behaviour.																	0022-0477					FEB	2000	88	1					139	149		10.1046/j.1365-2745.2000.00436.x								WOS:000085946700011

Temperature was the primary factor for the induction of summer diapause in this species. The critical temperature for diapause induction was approximately 24 degrees C, regardless of the photoperiod. At 23 degrees C, the development of the diapausing pupae was arrested the day after pupariation, when about 7% of the total pupal development had occurred in terms of total effective temperature (degree-days). The most sensitive period for temperature with regard to diapause induction was estimated to be between pupariation and "pupation" (i.e., evagination of the head in cyclorrhaphous flies). Completion of diapause occurred at a wide range of temperatures (4-25 degrees C): The optimal temperature was approximately 16 degrees C, at which temperature only five days were required for diapause completion. The characteristics of summer diapause in D. antiqua are discussed in comparison with those of summer dormancy in a congener D. radicum and those of winter diapause in D. antiqua.

J	Sanz, JJ; Tinbergen, JM; Moreno, J; Orell, M; Verhulst, S				Sanz, JJ; Tinbergen, JM; Moreno, J; Orell, M; Verhulst, S			Latitudinal variation in parental energy expenditure during brood rearing in the great tit	OECOLOGIA												The variation in time and energy allocation of female great tits, Pants major, was studied in five different European populations across a latitudinal gradient. Daily energy expenditure (DEE) was measured in fe males tending 12-day-old broods. The number of daylight hours used by the parents to collect food for the brood increased with latitude, while DEE and feeding rate per brood tended to level off with latitude. Individual variation in DEE could be explained by variation in ambient temperature (-), the duration of activity period (+) and area, but not by brood size, female body mass, brood mass or feeding rate. When the effect of ambient temperature and the duration of the activity period on the day of energy expenditure measurements were controlled for, female DEE still tended to level off with latitude. Temperature and activity alone can thus not explain the observed pattern. The present study suggests that parents at southern latitudes may be under a time constraint and do not increase energy expenditure because they have no more daylight hours available for foraging, while birds at northern latitudes may be under an energy constraint because they do not make full use of the long daylight period available.

J	Townsend, GD; Pritchard, G				Townsend, GD; Pritchard, G			Egg development in the stonefly Pteronarcys californica Newport (Plecoptera : Pteronarcyidae)	AQUATIC INSECTS												Eggs of Pteronarcys californica Newport were incubated at fixed temperatures between 5 and 20 degrees C in the laboratory and at field temperatures in the Crowsnest River, Alberta. The regression of rate of development on temperature between 5-15 degrees C gave a developmental zero of 3.125 degrees C. Within the range 10-20 degrees C, highest hatching success and fewest days to median hatch occurred at 15.0 or 17.5 degrees C, but physiological time (day-degrees) for egg hatching increased with temperature throughout, markedly so above 15 degrees C. A minimum of 182 days was required for 50% hatch in the laboratory, with no observable development for approximately 80 days. Eggs placed in the river on 25 May 1993 started to hatch on 17 October 1993, and the pulse of larval recruitment in the field population occurred between April and August, 11 to 15 months after oviposition. Eggs hatched over periods of 130-322 days at different temperatures in the laboratory, and over an 11-month period in the field. The placement of diapause early in embryonic development is suggested as a cause of extended recruitment. The variety of embryonic development in Plecoptera is briefly reviewed.																	0165-0424					JAN	2000	22	1					19	26		10.1076/0165-0424(200001)22:1;1-Z;FT019								WOS:000085483700003						
J	Leloup, JC; Goldbeter, A				Leloup, JC; Goldbeter, A			Modeling the molecular regulatory mechanism of circadian rhythms in Drosophila	BIOESSAYS												Thanks to genetic and biochemical advances on the molecular mechanism of circadian rhythms in Drosophila, theoretical models closely related to experimental observations can be considered for the regulatory mechanism of the circadian clock in this organism. Modeling is based on the autoregulatory negative feedback exerted by a complex between PER and TIM proteins on the expression of per and tim genes. The model predicts the occurrence of sustained circadian oscillations in continuous darkness. When incorporating light-induced TIM degradation, the model accounts for damping of oscillations in constant light, entrainment of the rhythm by light-dark cycles of varying period or photoperiod, and phase shifting by light pulses. The model further provides a molecular dynamical explanation for the permanent or transient suppression of circadian rhythmicity triggered in a variety of organisms by a critical pulse of light. Finally, the model shows that to produce a robust rhythm the various clock genes must be expressed at the appropriate levels since sustained oscillations only occur in a precise range of parameter values.

(Cucurbitaceae) in various combinations were studied. The effect of temperature on the development and mortality of M. pygmaeus nymphs was also studied. Experiments were conducted in temperature cabinets maintained at 65 +/- 5% RH, 16L:8D h photoperiod, and constant temperatures, depending on the experiment. Results demonstrated that M. pygmaeus can successfully complete its development on tomato, eggplant, cucumber, pepper, and green beans in the absence of insect prey. In the presence of insect prey, IM. pygmaeus had the shortest period of nymphal development on eggplant with Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Westwood) followed by Myzus persicae (Sulzer), Macrosiphum euphorbiae (Thomas), Aphis gossypii Glover, and Tetranychus urticae Koch. Mortality of M. pygmaeus nymphs was relatively higher in the absence than in the presence of prey on various host plants but was not considered a factor restricting predator establishment. M; pygmaeus completed its development, even in the absence of prey, under a range of temperatures from 15 to 30 degrees C on tomato, with optimum development at 30 degrees C. Bee pollen and pollen from E. elaterium, when offered separately, were sufficient to support successful predator nymphal development and survival. Bee pollen contributed considerably to the development and survival of the nymphs when it was included in diets containing other food sources, like eggplant leaves and M. persicae.

J	Madec, L; Desbuquois, C; Coutellec-Vreto, MA				Madec, L; Desbuquois, C; Coutellec-Vreto, MA			Phenotypic plasticity in reproductive traits: importance in the life history of Helix aspersa (Mollusca : Helicidae) in a recently colonized habitat	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY												Reproductive traits of the land snail Helix aspersa Muller were investigated under artificial conditions from two samples, one collected from a population exposed to unpredictable human pressures in its natural environment, i.e. a recently created polder area with intensive agriculture, and the other from a snail farm in which animals were reared under constant conditions defined as 'optimal' for growth and reproduction. Results were compared with data collected from natural populations of the same region (Brittany) and from habitats spanning the environmental heterogeneity of the range of the species. A large part of the variation among populations could be explained by different phenotypic covariances between shell size, clutch size and egg size, but not by the number of clutches per snail. Thus, the higher egg production of snails from the polders was related to (i) a strong correlation between clutch size and shell size, shell size being in the upper limit of the overall range for the region concerned; (ii) an uncommonly low egg weight in comparison with the 'norm' of Helix aspersa, this trait seeming to be involved in a trade-off with clutch size. Second clutches were smaller than the first ones, but their eggs were significantly heavier. This difference may be linked to a size-dependent mortality of juveniles during winter which arises in all populations in which hibernation occurs as an adaptation to low temperatures. In addition to the selective regime usually involved for populations of helicid snails from Western Europe, several unpredictable mortality factors occurred in the polders area: herbicide and pesticide treatments (lethal for young snails), human predation (lethal for adults) and burning (lethal for all snails). Life-history patterns of Helix aspersa are discussed in relation to its ability to successfully colonize a large range of habitats modified by humans, to such an extent that it can become a pest.

B	Sullivan, MJ; Currin, CA		Weinstein, MP; Kreeger, DA		Sullivan, MJ; Currin, CA			Community structure and functional dynamics of benthic microalgae in salt marshes	CONCEPTS AND CONTROVERSIES IN TIDAL MARSH ECOLOGY					Meeting on Concepts and Controversies in Tidal Marsh Ecology	APR, 1998	VINELAND, NJ					Benthic microalgae are a ubiquitous feature in sediments directly exposed to full sunlight or shaded by a vascular plant canopy in coastal salt marshes. Diatoms, cyanobacteria, and green algae are the dominant groups. Of these, diatoms are universally present and abundant, exhibit migratory rhythms driven mainly by light, and are by far the taxonomically most diverse group. Dense mats of cyanobacteria and secondarily green algae frequently develop where light levels are high. The more abundant species of all three algal groups are widely distributed within and among salt marshes of the United States and Europe. Standing crops of benthic microalgae beneath various vascular plant canopies exhibit mean annual values of 60 to 160 mg chi a m(-2). Annual benthic microalgal production (BMP) has been shown to range from 28 g C m(-2) y(-1) beneath (-2) 1 beneath Jaumea carnosa. In general, BMP Juncus roemerianus to 314 g C m(-2) y(-1) increases in a southerly direction in Atlantic coast marshes but is lowest in Gulf Coast marshes. In Atlantic and southern California marshes a significant portion of benthic microalgal production occurs when the overstory vascular plants are dormant. Experimental manipulations have shown that BMP and biomass beneath Spartina alterniflora are limited by nitrogen supplies and grazing activities. Manipulation of light appears to primarily affect the relative dominance of diatoms and cyanobacteria in the benthic microalgal assemblage. The ratio of annual BMP to net aerial production of the overstory vascular plant canopy is 10 to 60% in Atlantic and Gulf Coast marshes and 75 to 140% in a southern California marsh. The benthic microalgal portion of this two component productivity system has been shown by multiple stable isotope studies to be a major component of salt marsh food webs. Diatoms, in particular, are the preferred food item of a diverse array of invertebrate and fish species.																			0-7923-6019-2				2000							81	106										WOS:000167496200006

NMR measurements showed that various organs could be seen and identified. It also showed that by changing the diet of the ladybird from aphids [Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris)] to a standard artificial diet, major changes took place in the insects' tissues. By using a combination of all three techniques it was concluded that on changing the diet of C. septempunctata a mass of nutrient was built up within the insect's abdomen possibly in the same manner as happens before diapause. Changes in the response to NMR measurements were also seen after infection of C. septempunctata by the parasitoid wasp (Dinocampus coccinellae). Most significantly an image of the parasitoid larva could be seen within the body mass of the ladybird. It was con eluded that NMR could become a major tool in the non-destructive study of insects not just as a means of studying anatomy but also to observe changes in the nature of body tissue.																	1210-5759						2000	97	4					457	461		10.14411/eje.2000.070								WOS:000166433200004

On a fringing coral reef at Eilat, Israel, northern Red Sea, we examined patterns of abundance and clonal replication in R. rhodostoma in order to understand the modes and rates of spread of polyps across the reef flat. Polyps were abundant on the inner reef flat (maximum 1510 polyps m(-2) and 69% cover), rare on the outer reef flat, and completely absent on the outer reef slope at >3 m depth. Individuals cloned throughout the year via 3 distinct modes: longitudinal fission, inverse budding, and marginal budding. Marginal budding is a replicative mode not previously described. Cloning mode varied significantly with polyp size. Approximately 9% of polyps cloned each month, leading to a clonal doubling time of about 1 year. The rate of cloning varied seasonally and depended on day length and seawater temperature, except for a brief reduction in cloning during midsummer when polyps spawned gametes. Polyps of R. rhodostoma appear to have replicated extensively following a catastrophic low-tide disturbance in 1970, and have become an alternate dominant to stony corals on parts of the reef flat.

J	Hind, A; Gurney, WSC; Heath, M; Bryant, AD				Hind, A; Gurney, WSC; Heath, M; Bryant, AD			Overwintering strategies in Calanus finmarchicus	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The marine copepod Calanus finmarchicus is known to overwinter at depth in a state analogous to diapause in terrestrial insects, but the cues which cause individuals to enter and leave this state are the subject of speculation. In this paper we use a simple demographic model, driven by environmental data from 4 distinct locations in the organism's eastern range, to test the plausibility of a number of candidate mechanisms. We start from Miller et al.'s (1991; Mar Ecol Frog Ser 72:79-91) hypothesis that diapause is controlled by photoperiod, and show that this leads to unrealistic patterns of reproductive activity in northern waters. We extend the model to include the recently reported phenomenon (Hirche 1996a; Ophelia 44:111-128) of delayed gonad maturation in females experiencing low food concentrations. This yields more plausible annual patterns, but fails to reproduce observed geographical variation in the timing of the yearly onset of reproductive activity. Our final model dispenses with photoperiodic control and assumes that diapause duration is controlled by the normal development processes operating at a reduced rate. This model reproduces all the qualitative features of the patterns of reproductive activity observed at our 4 test sites, thus demonstrating that photoperiod cueing is not a necessary prerequisite for the regular re-ascension of C. finmarchicus into surface waters.

Under laboratory conditions, S. monticolum infected a wide range of insect species but appeared best adapted to lepidopteran larvae as hosts. It uses an intermediate foraging strategy with a low attachment rate to mobile hosts on the soil surface and poor infection of sedentary hosts placed at greater than or equal to5 cm soil depth. S. monticolum infected hosts over a wide range of soil moisture ranging from -1500 kPa to -3 kPa. It has a wide thermal activity range with optimum infectivity from 12 to 25 degreesC. When stored in water over a 6 month period, S. monticolum persisted well from 5 to 25 degreesC. Its infectivity also remained high when stored from 5 to 15 degreesC but declined faster at 25 degreesC. Because of its foraging strategy and adaptation to cool temperatures, S. monticolum has potential for the control of pests, especially Lepidoptera, that hibernate in the upper soil layer or soil litter.																	1388-5545						2000	2		4				407	416		10.1163/156854100509268								WOS:000165417000004

The purpose of the study was to assess the influence of late season prescribed fire on the vigor of serviceberry, a key browse species on white-tailed deer (Odecoileus virginianus ochrourus) winter range in northeastern Washington. All plants displayed similar TAC cycles through the first growing season following treatment. TAC levels in stems were highest prior to bud activity and declined during the early stages of growth (March, April, May). The low levels of stem TAC coincided with periods of maximum stem growth. Roots had the highest TAC concentrations prior to dormancy, then declined as stem elongation progressed to mid-season. After maximum stem elongation, root TAC levels increased significantly through the remaining growing season. Late summer burned plants displayed immediate new growth following treatment, and advanced phenology during the first growing season in contrast to fall burned and control plants. The first year growth of fall burned shrubs was delayed until after control plants had initiated stem elongation. Neither burn treatment had major impacts on carbohydrate storage nor vigor of shrub growth.																							2000		21					302	305										WOS:000175696900041						
J	Eads, BD; Hand, SC				Eads, BD; Hand, SC			Regulatory features of transcription in isolated mitochondria from Artemia franciscana embryos	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-REGULATORY INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY												Optimal conditions were developed for an in organello transcriptional run-on assay using mitochondria isolated from Artemia franciscana embryos to investigate potential regulatory features of RNA synthesis under conditions of anoxia-induced quiescence. Transcription is not dependent on oxidative phosphorylation for maximal activity when exogenous ATP is available. Bona fide transcription products, as assessed by hybridization with specific mitochondrial cDNAs from A. franciscana, are produced in an inhibitor-sensitive manner. Transcription rate measured at pH 7.9 is reduced 80% when pH is lowered to 6.3, a pH range that mimics the in vivo change seen on exposure of embryos to anoxia. The proton sensitivity of mitochondrial RNA synthesis may provide a mechanism to depress this significant energy expenditure during quiescence. The influence of nucleotide concentration on kinetics is complicated by an interdependence among nucleotide species. ATP inhibition observed at subsaturating UTP concentrations is relieved when UTP is at saturating, physiologically relevant levels. Taken together, these data suggest that local (versus nuclear mediated) control is important in dictating mitochondrial transcription during rapid modulations in gene expression, such as those observed under anoxia-induced quiescence.																	0363-6119					DEC	1999	277	6					R1588	R1597										WOS:000084225100007	29598732

Calculations took into account the composition and age structure of forests as well as the temperature dependencies of VOC emission rate for the main European forest-forming tree species. In the case of isoprene, the dependence on illumination level and day length was also taken into account. Estimations were made for all 49 administrative regions of Poland. Depending on weather conditions in different years, the total VOC emission of Polish forests can be in the range 186-763 kt yr(-1). For instance, for a moderately warm year, 1992, it was estimated at 440.6 kt, which represents 25% of the total VOC emissions in Poland. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In Experiment I, IHR was determined for 1-h periods twice a day, in daytime and at night, to investigate development of heart rate fluctuations (variability and irregularities). Chick IHR was substantially more arrhythmic than embryonic HR and spontaneous accelerations dominated HR fluctuations. Chick HR fluctuations were categorized into three types, [1] Type I as a widespread baseline HR (20-50 bpm) due to respiratory arrhythmia, with a mean oscillatory frequency of 0.74 Hz (range 0.4-1.2 Hz); [2] Type II as low frequency oscillations of baseline HR, at a mean of 0.07 Hz (range 0.04-0.10 Hz), and [3] Type III as non-cyclic irregularities, dominated by frequent transient accelerations. In Experiment II, continuous measurements of HR were made under conditions of a natural photoperiod, thermoneutrality and with feed available throughout the first week after hatching and circadian rhythms of HR were ascertained. HR was very variable in the daytime (250-500 bpm), due in part to feeding and activity, and decreased to a diurnal low (200-350 bpm) at night when mean HR was relatively stable. HR fluctuations persisted throughout the diurnal cycle. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Heide, OM; Gauslaa, Y				Heide, OM; Gauslaa, Y			Developmental strategies of Koenigia islandica, a high-arctic annual plant	ECOGRAPHY												Seed germination, growth and flowering of the arctic-alpine annual Koenigia islandica were studied in controlled environment. Intact (unabraded) seeds germinated poorely at temperatures up to 18 degrees C, with an optimum at 24 degrees C (89% in 10 d). Scarified seeds germinated rapidly, and reached 100% germination in 3 d at 21 degrees C, but no > 40% germination occurred at 9 and 12 degrees C. Thr seeds had no light requirement For germination, nor did fluctuating temperatures improve germination. Dry matter production was optimal at 12 degrees C in both short day (SD) and long day (LD) conditions, but was markedly higher in LD than in SD at identical fluences at all temperatures except 21 degrees C where the plants showed symptoms of severe heat stress. The temperature compensation point for net productivity was estimated to 24 degrees C, and negative carbon balance at higher temperatures might be an important physiological mechanism limiting the distribution of K. islandica in Scandinavia. Flowering was extremely rapid and independent of daylength, even in a high-arctic population from 79 degrees N. In full summer daylight anthesis was reached 24 d after germination and seeds ripened after 36 d at 15 degrees C. Days to anthesis varied little across the temperature range from 6 to 21 degrees C, giving a linear decrease in the heat-sum requirement for the attainment of flowering with decreasing temperature. It is concluded that conservative seed germination strategy, tininess and rapid development. low temperature optima for growth and reproduction, and daylength indifference of flowering are important adaptations For success of an annual plant in high-arctic and high-alpine environments. Daylength neutrality has facilitated the wide-latitudinal distribution of K. islandica, including the penetration of the species to the southern hemisphere.																	0906-7590					DEC	1999	22	6					637	642		10.1111/j.1600-0587.1999.tb00512.x								WOS:000085437500004

Reproduction occurred during a marked season in the agropastoral reservoirs and in Lake Ayame, whereas it was continuous in Lake Kossou. Spawning season differed between reservoirs and among years within the same reservoir. Seasonal changes in temperature, rainfall, day length, chlorophyll a concentration and water level often corresponded with changes in the annual spawning cycle. However, annual periodicity of O. niloticus reproduction was more likely influenced by the ephemerides cycle.

J	Logan, JA; Bentz, BJ				Logan, JA; Bentz, BJ			Model analysis of mountain pine beetle (Coleoptera : Scolytidae) seasonality	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												The mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins, is a natural disturbance agent of considerable consequence in western pine forests. This economically and ecologically important insect has a strong requisite for maintaining a strict seasonality. Given this ecological requirement, it is somewhat surprising that no evidence for diapause or other physiological tinting mechanism has been found. Seasonality and phenological timing for this species are apparently under direct temperature control. We investigate the consequences of direct temperature control by first constructing a computationally efficient phenology model based on previously published temperature dependent developmental data. We explored the dynamic properties of this model when subjected to observed microhabitat temperatures representing a range of thermal habitats from one region of the mountain pine beetle distribution. We also investigated the consequences of global climate change on phenology and seasonality. Our results indicate that an adaptive seasonality is a natural consequence of the interaction between developmental parameters and seasonal temperatures. Although this adaptive phenology appears to be resilient to temperature fluctuations, changes in climate within the magnitude of predicted climate change under a CO(2) doubling scenario are capable of shifting a thermally hostile environment to a thermally benign environment. Similarly, increasing temperature by the same amount resulted in phenological disruption of a previously favorable thermal habitat. We discuss the implications of these results for restricting the current distribution of mountain pine beetle, and the potential for shifting distribution caused by global climate change.																	0046-225X					DEC	1999	28	6					924	934		10.1093/ee/28.6.924								WOS:000084592500002

This study compared the norms of reaction in three life-history traits between the univoltine Aomori and multivoltine Mitsuma populations. The directions of response in the norms of reaction were similar in both populations, although their response curves differed between populations. This result indicated a potential for variation in seasonal phenotypic plasticity in the univoltine population. However, the variation in the norms of reaction was small in both populations, suggesting strong selection pressure on the plasticity in the multivoltine population. These results also suggest that the univoltine Aomori population may have originated from a multivoltine population.																	0014-3820					DEC	1999	53	6					1979	1986		10.1111/j.1558-5646.1999.tb04579.x								WOS:000084703100030	28565466

The typical habitat was maquis terrain with small and large bushes on gravel or rocky ground. Telemetric studies showed that cryptic basking behaviour was used during 23.5% of the localisations, and a preference for large bushes (77.7%). The mean distance moved between two succeeding days was 28.5 m (with s((x) over bar) of 47.9), and in general, the male home range covered an area of 10 to 20 ha, while the female home range was smaller. Hibernacula were south facing and situated in the middle of the home ranges. Population density was 50 adult vipers per km(2) in the optimal habitats. The total population for western Miles was estimated to be around 2,500 adult vipers during the study period (1993-98). The present total population on Miles seems to be below 3,000 adult animals. The species has been isolated since the Pliocene, and adapted to a diet of passerine birds. A pattern of twice-a-year foraging during spring and autumn bird migrations was highlighted. During spring, the vipers tend to be concentrated around water pools; in the dry autumn nights they climb up trees for resting birds. In years with a cold spring or autumn, critical situations may occur with starvation, resulting in cyclic population patterns. Mid-May is the mating period. The female reproductive cycle is biennial. The sex ratio is nearly equal. Around 600 specimens reach adulthood and participate in the reproductive activities each year. Mining and fires destroy habitat. The yearly estimated removal by man and road killing of vipers is up to 500-600 adult specimens. Thus, the input and out-take of adult specimens is of the same magnitude, and equal to a yearly 25% turnover. This indicates a very delicate balance, and even a small change that increases the removed number can lead towards a rapid extinction. A conservation program is urgently needed and should include the establishment of protected areas, the closing of roads for night-time driving, and prohibition of increased mining activities.																	0173-5373					NOV	1999	20	4					355	375		10.1163/156853899507121								WOS:000084551500001						
J	van Klinken, RD				van Klinken, RD			Developmental host-specificity of Mozena obtusa (Heteroptera : Coreidae), a potential biocontrol agent for Prosopis species (Mesquite) in Australia	BIOLOGICAL CONTROL												Mozena obtusa Uhler (Heteroptera: Coreidae) was examined in quarantine for its potential as a biological control agent of Prosopis species (mesquite) in Australia. Trials were conducted on 16 nontarget plant species to estimate its developmental host range. Complete development occurred on all Prosopis species that have become naturalized in Australia as web as on four Australian native species (Neptunia species and Paraserianthes lophantha), although reproductive diapause prevented assessment of subsequent fecundity. Development through the first feeding nymphal instar also occurred on other plant species representing two subfamilies. Nymphal performance was highly variable on both target and nontarget species, possibly because variation in plant nitrogen composition affected plant quality. The correlation between environment, plant nitrogen, and plant quality is likely to be sufficiently strong to determine whether a plant species can support development. Plant quality should therefore be considered when predicting the field host range of M. obtusa and of sap-sucking coreids generally. Nonetheless, our preliminary results suggest that M. obtusa may not be sufficiently specific for release in Australia, although insufficient understanding of its oviposition behavior in the held and the effect of plant quality on development means that its rejection would be premature.

J	Armbruster, P; Bradshaw, WE; Steiner, AL; Holzapfel, CM				Armbruster, P; Bradshaw, WE; Steiner, AL; Holzapfel, CM			Evolutionary responses to environmental stress by the pitcher-plant mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii	HEREDITY												We performed truncation selection for increased fitness (r(c)) under conditions of chronic stress from the combined effects of low nutrients and high temperature, representative of extremes likely to be encountered in nature by the pitcher-plant mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii. We performed selection on geographical parental populations and their hybrids to determine whether hybridization would facilitate or constrain adaptation under our selection protocol. The stressful environment decreased fitness (r(c)) by 54% averaged across all populations relative to near-optimal conditions. After approximate to 10 generations of selection under chronically stressful conditions, exactly one-half of the parental and one-half of the hybrid populations had gone extinct. Thus hybridization had no effect on the likelihood of population persistence. Fitness (r(c)) of the surviving populations did not show any response to selection. Despite initial hybrid vigour under stressful conditions, the fitness (r(c)) of surviving hybrid populations was either equal to, or worse than, the fitness (r(c)) of surviving parental populations after approximate to 10 generations of selection. These results suggest that outcrossing populations to augment genetic variation and facilitate adaptation to a rapidly changing environment may not be useful over longer time scales, even in cases where hybridization does initially increase fitness. Although we detected no direct response to selection for increased fitness (r(c)) under lifetime chronic stress, selected populations showed a strong correlated response for survivorship through transient, acute heat and desiccation shock. In evaluating how organisms might respond to future climate change, biologists must maintain a clear distinction between lifelong performance in chronically stressful environments and short-term survivorship through transient, acute stress.																	0018-067X					NOV	1999	83		5				509	519		10.1038/sj.hdy.6886040								WOS:000084472200002						
J	Noonan, GR				Noonan, GR			GIS analysis of the biogeography of beetles of the subgenus Anisodactylus (Insecta : Coleoptera : Carabidae : genus Anisodactylus)	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												The advent of GIS technology and the World Wide Web, respectively, facilitate analysing geographical relationships and electronically storing and exchanging biogeographic data. This paper illustrates GIS technology with a study of the subgenus Anisodactylus Dejean (Insecta: Coleoptera: Carabidae: genus Anisodactylus). Species are concentrated in three centres of biodiversity in North America and in four in lands near the western Mediterranean. These centres largely correspond to current areas of wetlands. Eurasia has fewer species than expected based on its area, probably because large portions have habitats unfavourable for the subgenus and/or are poorly collected for Carabidae. Members of the subgenus are primarily adapted to areas with January temperatures between -10 and 10 degrees C, July temperatures from 10 to 30 degrees C and mean annual precipitation from 20 to 200 mm. Cold is apparently a major limiting factor because it typically occurs during several consecutive months of winter and is difficult to escape except by hibernation. Heat is less of a stress when moisture is sufficient. The size of geographical ranges is often larger in the North than in the South and correlates with the latitude of the centre of ranges at r =0.42 (level of significance =0.05). Geographic ranges are often smaller in western North America and in the western Mediterranean than elsewhere in the Northern Hemisphere. Explanations for the smaller sizes include portions of western North America having unfavourable desert or montane habitats, the Rocky Mountains and deserts barring eastward dispersal of species, and the smaller size and more patchy distribution of climatic zones and habitats. In North America geographical ranges west of the Rocky Mountains are north-south elongated because they track primarily north-south orientated climatic zones and because mountains and deserts bar eastward extension. Ranges in north-eastern and north-central North America tend to extend east-west along temperature isotherms. In Eurasia many ranges are stretched east-west because of the shape of the continent and because many northern and southern areas lack suitable habitats. Species with relatively high numbers of apomorphic character states cluster in western Eurasia and to a lesser extent in western North America. The North American centres of biodiversity are post-Wisconsin phenomena while those near the western Mediterranean probably dale from the Oligocene or Miocene.																	0305-0270					NOV	1999	26	6					1147	1160		10.1046/j.1365-2699.1999.00362.x								WOS:000085366500002						
J	Heideman, PD; Bruno, TA; Singley, JW; Smedley, JV				Heideman, PD; Bruno, TA; Singley, JW; Smedley, JV			Genetic variation in photoperiodism in Peromyscus leucopus: Geographic variation in an alternative life-history strategy	JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY												Phenotypic variation in reproductive response to photoperiod is typical of many temperate-zone populations of rodents. This variation could be due either to genetic variation in photoresponsiveness or phenotypic plasticity within populations genetically homogeneous for photoresponsiveness. At least some of this variation has been shown to be genetic in single populations of three species of rodents and in one laboratory population of another species of rodent. Neither the latitudinal range over which this genetic variation occurs nor the frequency with which populations contain this kind of genetic variation is known. To test for genetic variation in reproductive photoresponsiveness in a population of Peromyscus from a mid-temperate latitude, a population of P. leucopus from Williamsburg, Virginia (37degrees16'N, 76degrees42'W), was subjected to artificial selection either for reproductive response or lack of reproductive response to photoperiod, with a control line that was not subject to selection. Reproductive photoresponsiveness was significantly heritable (narrow sense h(2) ranging from 0.54 to 0.74 in the first laboratory generation). Three generations of selective breeding yielded one line of mice with 80% of individuals responding strongly to photoperiod (regression of gonads under short day length, 8L:16D) and a nonresponsive line with only 16% strongly responsive individuals. There were significant responses to selection in each generation in one or both selected lines, while a control line changed significantly only in one sex in a single generation. These results are similar to those from a population from Michigan (43degreesN) but are different from a population from Georgia (34degreesN). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that genetic variation in photoresponsiveness is present in a mosaic pattern rather than a latitudinal cline. Presence of genetic variation in reproductive photoresponsiveness in two widely separated populations of P. leucopus provides support for the hypothesis that genetic variation in reproductive photoresponsiveness is likely to be a common life-history feature of populations of this species between 37 and 45degreesN, and probably further north as well.

The National Agricultural Research Council hill research institutes at Hattiban, Lumle, and Pakhribas were selected for study. In addition, the temperature regimes of a typical span of elevations (600-2,400 m) were constructed to examine the range of environmental variability associated with cropping in this region. Models predicting rates of crop development were used to determine the feasibility of six legume cover species to reach maturity prior to the sowing period for the principal summer cereal crops. Model outputs indicate substantial variability in maturity dates resulting from genotype, site, elevation, and sowing date effects. Vicia faba, Vicia villosa ssp. dasycarpa, and Lupinus mutabilis grown as autumn-sown crops across most of the mid-hills would be feasible where early sowing is possible. More caution would be needed if Vida saliva or Trifolium resupinatum were chosen because they are only likely to mature early enough to permit unhindered summer cereal sowing at lower elevations.																	0276-4741					NOV	1999	19	4					325	332										WOS:000083892400008

Sites in southwestern Uganda, covering a range in elevations from 1,600 to 2,500 m and having a bi-modal rainfall distribution, were used as an exemplar. In such locations, it was evident that several of the short-day "tropical" species tested were ill-adapted and would be unlikely to reach pod maturity within the time available in either of the two growing seasons, particularly at higher elevations. More temperate species, particularly Vicia spp., were better adapted but delays in sowing and increasing elevation severely restricted the potential choice of an appropriate species. The flexibility of the models as potential tools for scaling-up location-specific agronomic research trials is discussed.																	0276-4741					NOV	1999	19	4					345	353										WOS:000083892400010						
J	Liedtke, AJ; Lynch, ML				Liedtke, AJ; Lynch, ML			Alteration of gene expression for glycolytic enzymes in aerobic and ischemic myocardium	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-HEART AND CIRCULATORY PHYSIOLOGY												The purpose of this report was to describe mRNA abundance for the glycolytic enzymes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), pyruvate kinase, and pyruvate dehydrogenase in ischemic and adjacent aerobic myocardium. Mechanical, metabolic, and mRNA data were acquired in a pig model of regulated coronary flow using extracorporeal perfusion. Trials of coronary hypoperfusion included sustained and intermittent exposures of acute ischemia with or without reperfusion. These were compared with a chronic 4-day model of partial coronary stenosis. In ischemic tissues, levels of mRNA, normalized by mRNA for beta-actin, were increased over control values for GAPDH (range 2.7- to 4.6-fold), pyruvate kinase (2.9-fold), and pyruvate dehydrogenase (2.1-fold). It is of interest that increases in mRNA levels over control values were also observed in adjacent aerobic heart muscle from intervention hearts, including 3.6- to 4.5-fold elevations in message for GAPDH and a 2.1-fold increase in signal for pyruvate dehydrogenase. Augmentation in mRNA abundance occurred in as short a time as 40 min of ischemia and was maintained for as long as 4 days in partial coronary stenosis. Whether the former time was of an interval sufficient to affect protein production is problematic, but the latter time was ample to influence enzyme concentration, which may in turn have regulated glycolysis in this condition.																	0363-6135					OCT	1999	277	4					H1435	H1440										WOS:000083919400021	29598520

ARCHIVES OF INSECT BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY												Developmental profiles of dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) in the larval CNS of Chymomyza costata were measured by HPLC using electrochemical detection. Larvae of two strains, wild-type (W) and nondiapause mutant (M), were maintained either under long-day (LD, inducing pupariation) or short-day (SD, inducing diapause in W-strain) photoperiods. The levels of DA ranged from 10 fmol/CNS (early 3rd instar larvae) to 60 fmol/CNS (150-day-old diapausing larvae); the range for 5-HT was from 10 fmol/CNS to 75 fmol/CNS in the same larvae. During the 3rd larval instar, which is the decisive stage for photoperiodic induction of diapause, no differences were found in DA developmental profiles between different strains or conditions. Some differences were found in 5-HT developmental profiles, but only after the end of sensitive stage, and were therefore regarded as insignificant for regulation of developmental mode. Similarly, no clear correlations between the developmental profiles of DA and 5-HT and the course of developmental changes during the maintenance and termination of a few-month-long larval diapause were observed. Furthermore, the DA and 5-HT levels in the CNS were pharmacologically manipulated by feeding the larvae with either precursors or enzyme inhibitors of DA and 5-HT biosynthesis. Although retardations of growth and development were observed, the treated larvae retained full capacity for the photoperiodic response, irrespective of the level of DA or 5-HT in their CNS. Larvae with their 5-HT depleted to trace levels survived and were capable of diapause induction, maintenance, and termination. Depletion of DA to trace levels resulted in 100% mortality. Collectively, the present study indicates that 5-HT in the CNS is dispensable for the photoperiodic response in C. costata. More information is needed to elucidate the potential role of DA.

J	Handy, RD; Depledge, MH				Handy, RD; Depledge, MH			Physiological responses: Their measurement and use as environmental biomarkers in ecotoxicology	ECOTOXICOLOGY												This paper briefly reviews the utility of physiological measurements as biomarkers of pollutant exposure and biological effect, and then gives a step by step description of methodologies used to measure physiological parameters in mostly fish and invertebrates, but also higher vertebrates where appropriate. The effects of pollutants on respiratory, cardiovascular, osmoregulatory, and neuro-endocrine processes are relatively well described in laboratory experiments and some of these responses (particularly ventilation, heart rate, and also body ion fluxes) have been evaluated as biomonitors or potential biomarkers in the field. Physiological assays are especially useful for monitoring fluctuating or complex exposures, or acting as "early warning" systems for acute events. Some biomarkers rely on a change in physiological response, and a prerequisite of such assay must be to establish the normal resting response in defined environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, pH, photoperiod, etc.). Biomarkers that rely on variability of response, rather than absolute values, may not require this "laboratory calibration." Methods are described for on line cardiovascular monitoring with shore crabs, field applications of closed respirometry and ion flux measurements with fish; and a range of blood parameters for animals including haemoglobin, haematocrit, cell counts, glucose, triglycerides, and protein from blood and organ perfusates. Each method includes a short critic of the approach.																	0963-9292					OCT	1999	8	5					329	349		10.1023/A:1008930404461								WOS:000085619700002

The authors undertook studies of the circadian and photoperiodic system of Japanese quail to try to identify a role for the circadian system in photoperiodic time measurement. The circadian studies showed that the circadian system acts like a low-amplitude oscillator: It is readily reset by Light without significant transients, has a Type 0 phase response curve (PRC), and has a large range of entrainment. In fact, a cycle length that is often used in resonance protocols (LD 6:30) is within the range of entrainment. The authors employed T-cycle experiments; that is, LD cycles with 6- and 14-h photoperiods and period lengths ranging from 18 to 36 h to test for circadian involvement in photoperiodic time measurement. The results did not give evidence for circadian involvement in photoperiodic time measurement: T-cycles utilizing 6-h photoperiods were uniformly noninductive (that is, did not stimulate the reproductive system), whereas T-cycles utilizing 14-h photoperiods were inductive (stimulatory). A good match was observed between the phase-angles exhibited on the T-cycles employing 6-h photoperiods and the predicted phase-angles calculated from a FRC generated from 6-h light pulses.																	0748-7304					OCT	1999	14	5					378	390		10.1177/074873099129000786								WOS:000086871400004	10511005					
J	Noddegaard, F; Kennaway, DJ				Noddegaard, F; Kennaway, DJ			A method of achieving physiological plasma levels of melatonin in the chicken by oral administration	JOURNAL OF PINEAL RESEARCH												In avian species it has been difficult to elucidate the precise role of melatonin in the control of reproductive cycles. We have investigated ways of administering melatonin to immature chickens and laying hens to achieve physiological levels and patterns in blood simulating either short or long photoperiods. Melatonin was administered orally using different doses and various ways of applying melatonin to the feed. For subcutaneous injections, melatonin was suspended in propylene glycol or grape seed oil. Melatonin always appeared in the first blood samples taken within an hour of administration. When melatonin was absorbed into feed pellets or whole wheat. a high initial plasma concentration was reached, followed by a rapid decrease over the ensuing 2-3 hr, but was still detectable as long as 24 hr after administration. For example, doses of 300 mu g/kg produced 15 nM, which is more than ten times higher than the nocturnal peak concentration. When melatonin was absorbed into cracked wheat grains that were subsequently washed with ethanol, the initial transitory peak was eliminated, levels in plasma were sustained for at least 12 hr in the normal nocturnal range (750 pM), and no melatonin ( < 60 pM) was present 18 hr later. When injected (2 mu g/bird), concentrations peaked (610 pM) within 30 min and decreased rapidly over the next 2-3 hr. It was concluded that melatonin-treated, ethanol-rinsed cracked wheat grains can be used to experimentally mimic long-night plasma melatonin patterns. Injections mag be useful for mimicking the melatonin patterns of very short nights in chickens experiencing constant light.

J	Krafsur, ES; Moon, RD; Kim, Y; Rosales, AL				Krafsur, ES; Moon, RD; Kim, Y; Rosales, AL			Dynamics of diapause recruitment in populations of the face fly, Musca autumnalis	MEDICAL AND VETERINARY ENTOMOLOGY												Field populations of face flies, Musca autumnalis DeGeer (Diptera: Muscidae) were sampled serially in the late summers and autumns of 1985-96, in order to measure the dynamics of diapause development in Iowa, U.S.A. Fat body hypertrophy and ovarian development were assessed through dissection, and pteridine quantities in the fly heads were measured spectrofluorometrically to estimate their physiological and chronological ages. Published laboratory studies of diapause induction established the expectation that diapause incidence would vary over successive years with prevailing temperatures. The expectation was not met by field data. Patterns in the frequencies of hypertrophied fat body and of vitellogenic nullipars indicated that about 50% of recruited adults began developing into diapause in the second week of September in each year. Degree-day summations for each year from 1985 to 1996 suggested that the hypothetical mean optimal time for switching into diapause would be in the second week of September, because a rapidly diminishing proportion of eggs laid later would result in viable, overwintering flies. It was concluded that face flies do not use daily temperatures in late summer, but instead cue on photoperiod for diapause.																	0269-283X	1365-2915				OCT	1999	13	4					337	348		10.1046/j.1365-2915.1999.00150.x								WOS:000084472400001	10608221					
J	Hagen, W				Hagen, W			Reproductive strategies and energetic adaptations of polar zooplankton	INVERTEBRATE REPRODUCTION & DEVELOPMENT					8th International Congress on Invertebrate Reproduction	AUG 10-14, 1998	AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS					Key factors governing polar ocean ecosystems are low temperatures and a pronounced seasonal variability of ice cover, light regime and primary production. Depending on their ecological niche and trophic position, zooplankton species at high latitudes have developed a variety of reproductive strategies and energetic adaptations to cope with these extreme environmental conditions. Life-cycle strategies of the herbivorous copepods and euphausiids, which make up the major portion of polar zooplankton biomass, include seasonal vertical migration, dormancy (diapause, quiescence) and the accumulation of energy reserves. These lipid stores help to buffer the pulsed seasonal food supply, and they play an important role in fueling reproduction independent of phytoplankton. Only a smaller fraction of the lipid reserves accumulated during spring and summer are usually catabolized for metabolic maintenance during the food-limited dark season. These deposits are retained until the end of winter and allow early egg production and spawning prior to - or coinciding with - the onset of vernal primary production. It enables the new generation to make full use of the short productive season for growth and development to reach viable overwintering stages. The Antarctic krill Euphausia superba is an exception since it uses its depot lipids for metabolic maintenance during the dark season. It therefore relies on external resources (primary production) for reproductive processes, resulting in a later spawning period as compared to the other euphausiids. Another important component of the herbivorous Antarctic zooplankton, the salps, have developed a very different reproductive strategy. They are able to switch from sexual reproduction to asexual budding (metagenesis), which allows extreme multiplication rates under favourable feeding conditions. Due to these successful adaptations, herbivores are able to build up huge stocks, in spite of the short productive period. Omnivorous and carnivorous zooplankton species, e.g., amphipods or chaetognaths, are not much constrained by the seasonality problem, but experience a more constant food supply. They show a tendency towards K strategies with a prolonged reproductive period, reduced egg numbers and increasing parental care. However, they do not exhibit such typical "polar adaptations" as developed by the herbivorous species.																	0168-8170					SEP	1999	36	1-3					25	34		10.1080/07924259.1999.9652674								WOS:000082280100004						
J	Biondini, ME; Steuter, AA; Hamilton, RG				Biondini, ME; Steuter, AA; Hamilton, RG			Bison use of fire-managed remnant prairies	JOURNAL OF RANGE MANAGEMENT												This study was designed to: 1) compare the landscape distribution patterns of bison on fire-managed prairie remnants in the tallgrass (Oklahoma), and mixed prairie (Nebraska); and 2) identify the extent to which fire and range site [topoedaphic classification of the landscape] affect bison distribution patterns. This research was conducted at 2 sites: the Niobrara Valley Preserve (1990-1996), and the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve (1993-1996). At both preserves, bison selected burned areas during the growing season for 1-3 years and mostly avoided old burns and unburned areas. There was an interaction between fire and range site in selection patterns. In the absence of fire, bison mostly avoided both the Choppy Sand range sites at the Niobrara Valley Preserve and Loamy Prairie range sites at the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve. When they were burned, however, these sites were highly selected. The main difference in bison selection patterns between the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve and the Niobrara Valley Preserve was observed during the dormant season. In the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve, burned sites continue to be preferred during the dormant period for an average of 2 years while in the Niobrara Valley Preserve selections mere random. These differences can be explained by 2 mechanisms: the fall and winter re-growth of forage at the more southern latitude and the significant physiognomic changes that fire can cause in tall grass prairies. Our study documents a continuing interaction between the ecological processes of the fire regime and bison distribution and abundance within 2 of the major prairie landscapes of the Great Plains, and provides critical details for understanding this relationship.																	0022-409X					SEP	1999	52	5					454	461		10.2307/4003772								WOS:000082837300008						
J	Pohl, H				Pohl, H			Spectral composition of light as a zeitgeber for birds living in the high arctic summer	PHYSIOLOGY & BEHAVIOR												The hypothesis was tested whether periodic changes in spectral composition of light are an effective zeitgeber for synchronization (entrainment) of circadian rhythms of birds breeding in the high arctic summer. Two palearctic pas serine birds, the brambling (Fringilla montifringilla) and the common redpoll (Carduelis f. flammea), which both breed during summer at latitudes above the Arctic Circle and migrate to temperate zone latitudes for wintering, were studied. To investigate the effect of daily alterations in light spectrum, bramblings were tested under 24-h cycles of fluorescent lights of different color temperatures (12 h at ca 5,000 K and 12 h at ca 2,500 K) and energy ratios varying between 16:1 and 0.3:1. Entrainment bf activity rhythms occurred at energy ratios of 1:1 (in all seven birds tested) and 0.8:1 (in three of seven birds tested) with activity mostly within the "blue" phase (ca 5,000 K). Light cycles alternating between narrow spectral ranges of blue (max. at 440 nm) and red (max. at 650 nm) and energy ratios of 1:1 and 1.1:1 (equivalent to ratios of photons flux of ca 0.67:1 and 0.73:1, respectively) were also effective in entraining the bramblings' activity rhythms (8 and 9 of 11 birds, respectively) with activity occurring primarily during the red phase. The activity rhythms of most common redpolls tested also entrained to blue:red light cycles (B:R 16.5:7.5 h) with equal energies during the blue and red phase (equivalent to a photons flux ratio of ca 0.67:1). The results support the hypothesis that passerine birds breeding in the arctic during summer may use the daily changes in spectal composition of sunlight as a zeitgeber for synchronizing physiological and behavioral rhythms, if changes in light intensity are not a reliable environmental cue.

J	Morgan, JW				Morgan, JW			Defining grassland fire events and the response of perennial plants to annual fire in temperate grasslands of south-eastern Australia	PLANT ECOLOGY												Many species-rich Themeda triandra grasslands in south-eastern Australia have been burnt annually in summer as a land management practice for decades. The characteristics of annual fires (maximum surface temperatures, maximum soil temperature changes at 10 mm depth, Byram fire intensity and duration of surface heating) were compared to fires that occur less frequently (2, 4 or 7-year inter-fire interval). The impacts of annual summer fires on seed survival, perennial plant dynamics and flowering were also documented at two sites over two years. Annual grassland fires differ principally from other grassland fire types in their duration of surface temperatures above 100 degrees C (i.e., < 1 min versus > 2-3 min in grasslands burnt at 4-7-year intervals). This was correlated to fuel load, but not rate of spread or Byram fire intensity. Maximum surface temperatures were variable within annual fire events (98-458 degrees C ) and did not differ significantly from those observed in other grassland fires. All sites experienced temperatures above 350 degrees C but no site had its soil temperature increase at 10 mm depth by > 10 degrees C during fire. Byram fire intensity was lower in annually burnt sites, but positively correlated with rate of spread moreso than fuel load. Many perennial species (34-55%) and most perennial individuals (70-83%) avoid the annual summer fire event by being dormant at the time of burning. All perennial species regenerated rapidly by vegetative means after fire and seedlings were absent or rare for most species. As a result, turnover of species at the small-scale was low. Annual burning permits high perennial species richness (mean 18 species/0.25 m(2)) and high numbers of individual perennial plants (range 189-1036 plants/0.25 m(2)) to co-exist at the small-scale. Seasonal plant density maxima peaked in spring, 6-8 months after fire, and the number of plants in a species' population each year following fire depended on their seasonal response more than their direct fire response. The direction and magnitude of population change from one year to the next was species and site specific and did not correlate with life form or a plant's ability for vegetative spread. All perennial species have a short secondary juvenile period (i.e., 6-11 months) but relatively few individual plants flower in any one year. Seed that has made its way into the soil is completely protected from the direct effects of fire and hence, occasional post-fire seedling recruitment may be possible for all species. Maintaining annual burning in grasslands as a management regime is unlikely to lead to a decline in richness and plant density in the short-term. Rather, delayed burning (i.e., > 3 year intervals), and the impact that this may have on interval dependent processes such as above-ground competition, are predicted to have more substantial long-term effects on the small-scale dynamic of this community.																	1385-0237					SEP	1999	144	1					127	144		10.1023/A:1009731815511								WOS:000082532400010

Moench] is an important cereal crop grown in a wide range of tropical and temperate environments. This study was conducted to characterise the photothermal flowering responses of sorghum genotypes and to examine relationships between photothermal characteristics and environment of origin in order to better understand the phenological basis of adaptation to environment in sorghum. Twenty-four germplasm accessions and one hybrid from 24 major sorghum-growing areas were grown in a wide range of environments varying in temperature and photoperiod in India, Kenya and Mall between 1992 and 1995. Times from sowing to flowering (f) were recorded, and the responsiveness of 1/f to temperature and photoperiod was quantified using photothermal models. Times from sowing to flowering were accurately predicted in a wide range of environments using a multiplicative rate photothermal model. Significant variation in the minimum time to flower (F-m) and photoperiod sensitivity (critical photoperiod, P-c, and photoperiod-sensitivity slope, P-s) was observed among the genotypes; in contrast there was little variation in base temperature (Tb) Adaptation of sorghum to the diverse environments in which it is grown was largely determined by photoperiod sensitivity and minimum time to flower; photoperiod sensitivity determines bread adaptation to latitude (daylength), while variation in the minimum time to flower determines specific adaptation within smaller ranges of latitude, e.g. within the humid and sub-humid tropics.

Many insects of the Osaka population entered diapause even under a long-day photoperiod at all temperatures used. Less than half of the insects showed a long-day photoperiodic response for the induction of diapause. In contrast, the higher the temperature, the greater the incidence of reproductive insects under a long-day photoperiod in the Hokkaido population. In Osaka where host plants of G. rubrolineatum produce seeds for only a limited period, an absence of suitable food is the primary factor which determines the timing of diapause induction. In contrast, temperature plays an important role in regulation of the life cycle of this species in Hokkaido.

J	Irwin, JT; Costanzo, JP; Lee, RE				Irwin, JT; Costanzo, JP; Lee, RE			Terrestrial hibernation in the northern cricket frog, Acris crepitans	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE												We used laboratory experiments and field observations to explore overwintering in the northern cricket frog, Acris crepitans, in southern Ohio and Indiana. Cricket frogs died within 24 h when submerged in simulated pond water that was anoxic or hypoxic, but lived 8-10 days when the water was oxygenated initially. Habitat selection experiments indicated that cricket frogs prefer a soil substrate to water as temperature decreases from 8 to 2C. These data suggested that cricket frogs hibernate terrestrially. However, unlike sympatric hylids, this species does not tolerate extensive freezing: only 2 of 15 individuals survived freezing in the -0.8 to -2.6C range (duration 24-96 h). Cricket frogs supercooled when dry (mean supercooling point -5.5C; range from -4.3 to -6.8C), but were easily inoculated by external ice at temperatures between -0.5 and -0.8C. Our data suggested that cricket frogs hibernate terrestrially but are notfreeze tolerant, are not fossorial, and are incapable of supercooling in the presence of external ice. Thus we hypothesized that cricket frogs must hibernate in terrestrial sites that adequately protect against freezing. Indeed, midwinter surveys revealed cricket frogs hibernating in crayfish burrows and cracksof the pond bank, where wet soils buffered against extensive freezing of the soil.																	0008-4301					AUG	1999	77	8					1240	1246		10.1139/cjz-77-8-1240								WOS:000083757200009						
J	Shintani, Y; Ishikawa, Y				Shintani, Y; Ishikawa, Y			Transition of diapause attributes in the hybrid zone of the two morphological types of Psacothea hilaris (Coleoptera : Cerambycidae)	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												Psacothea hilaris (Pascoe) is an important pest of mulberry trees in Japan. The subspecies P. hilaris hilaris, which is found in Kyushu, Shikoku, and Honshu, 3 of the 4 main islands of Japan, includes 2 different strains with clearly different seasonal prevalence and stripe patterns on the pronotum of the adult insect (i.e., the 'west Japan type' and 'east Japan type'). Hybridization between the 2 types occurs in nature, because stripe patterns and seasonal prevalence that are intermediate between the 2 types are found at the boundary of the distribution areas. In the current study, geographic variations in stripe pattern of the adults and diapause attribute of the larvae, an important determinant of seasonal prevalence, were examined using populations collected in Tokyo and the surrounding 10 prefectures. Hybridization between the 2 types was widely found in the areas where the east Japan type was once predominant, probably because of the eastward expansion of the west Japan type. The photoperiodic responses of the populations in the hybrid zone were ambiguous and intermediate between the clear long-day response and the nonphotoperiodic response, which characterize the west Japan and the east Japan types, respectively.																	0046-225X					AUG	1999	28	4					690	695		10.1093/ee/28.4.690								WOS:000082554100021						
J	Koveos, DS; Broufas, GD				Koveos, DS; Broufas, GD			Diapause induction and termination in eggs of the fruit tree red spider mite Panonychus ulmi in northern Greece	EXPERIMENTAL AND APPLIED ACAROLOGY												In apple orchards in northern Greece, females of Panonychus ulmi Koch were found to lay diapause eggs from late August to the beginning of October. The course of diapause termination in the field was determined by transferring diapause eggs during winter and early spring from apple orchards with the varieties 'Starkinson' and 'Firiki' to short days (LD 8:16) (1992-1996), and long days (LD 16:8) (1994-1995), both at 20 degrees C. Percentages of diapause termination were very low to zero from October to the beginning of January, then progressively increased throughout January and February. Diapause termination in 50% of the eggs occurred in the first half of February in lowland mite populations irrespective of the year and location from which the eggs originated, and about one month earlier in a population originating from an altitude of 300 m. For each sampling date throughout the winter, the mean number of days required for 50% egg hatch at 20 degrees C (T-50%) was similar under either a long (LD 16:8) or a short (LD 8:16) photoperiod. Diapause eggs collected in October 1995 from two orchards and maintained at 0, 5, 10 and 15 degrees C for various periods were subsequently transferred to 20 degrees C and LD 8:16, where TP50% was determined. It was shown that temperature, duration of maintenance at the different temperatures and the orchard from which the eggs originated had a significant effect on T(5)0% and therefore on diapause development. Additionally, in our strains diapause intensity was much weaker than in strains from more northern latitudes and was terminated even without any cold exposure. The variation in diapause intensity in different strains of P. ulmi may have an adaptive significance for this widespread species.

Eight Svalbard ptarmigan were caged outdoors at 70 degrees N and blood sampled throughout one day each month for 13 months. At this latitude, daylight is continuous between May and August, but there is a short period of civil twilight around noon from late November to mid January. There was no daily rhythm in plasma melatonin in May-July. Plasma melatonin levels varied significantly throughout the day in all other months of the year, with the nighttime increase reflecting the duration of darkness. The highest mean plasma concentration occurred at midnight in March (110.1 +/- 16.5 pg/ml) and represented the annual peak in estimated daily production. Around the winter solstice, melatonin levels were significantly reduced at noon and elevated during the nearly 18 h of consecutive darkness, and the estimated mean daily production of melatonin was significantly reduced. Thus, at the times of the year characterized by light-dark cycles, melatonin may convey information concerning the length of the day and, therefore, progression of season. The nearly undetectable low melatonin secretion in summer and the reduced amplitude and production in midwinter indicate a flexible circadian system that may reflect an important adaptation to life in the Arctic.																	0748-7304					AUG	1999	14	4					314	319		10.1177/074873099129000731								WOS:000083702900008	10447312					
J	Preston, KA				Preston, KA			Can plasticity compensate for architectural constraints on reproduction? Patterns of seed production and carbohydrate translocation in Perilla frutescens	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 The architecture of Perilla frutescens was manipulated by growing plants in a greenhouse under two photoperiodic regimes, representing conditions near the northern and southern ends of the species' range, to investigate its effect on patterns of seed production. Within each photoperiodic regime, plants were labelled with C-14 at one of three developmental stages at one of three leaf positions to assess the effects of architecture on carbohydrate translocation. 2 Perilla flowers in response to short days, i.e, southern-treatment plants flowered earlier and were smaller and more sparsely branched than northern-treatment plants. Branch number limits inflorescence number in Perilla, and southern-treatment plants therefore made fewer inflorescences. Inflorescences are, however, indeterminate, and the southern-treatment plants made more flowers per inflorescence than the northern-treatment plants, such that architecture did not constrain flower number. 3 As a result, plants in both treatments made a similar number of seeds and did not differ in total seed mass. 4 Increased seed production per inflorescence was associated with reduced carbohydrate movement between branches and more C-14-labelled assimilate per seed at the labelled node. 5 In summary, plasticity at the level of the inflorescence largely compensated for architectural constraints on inflorescence number, and was associated with differences in carbon translocation patterns between the photoperiod treatments.																	0022-0477					AUG	1999	87	4					697	712		10.1046/j.1365-2745.1999.00391.x								WOS:000082158400014						
J	Schmitt, J; Dudley, SA; Pigliucci, M				Schmitt, J; Dudley, SA; Pigliucci, M			Manipulative approaches to testing adaptive plasticity: Phytochrome-mediated shade-avoidance responses in plants	AMERICAN NATURALIST												Phenotypic plasticity is often assumed to be adaptive, but this hypothesis has rarely been tested. To support the hypothesis, it is necessary to demonstrate that the phenotype induced in each relevant environment confers high fitness in that environment, relative to alternative phenotypes. Unfortunately, such tests are difficult to perform because plasticity prevents the expression of "inappropriate" phenotypes within each environment. Genetic and physiological manipulation can be used very effectively to extend the range of phenotypes within environments and thus provide powerful tools for testing the adaptive plasticity hypothesis. The expression of specific genes involved in cue perception or signal transduction can be altered by mutation or the introduction of transgenes, thus altering the plastic response of an organism to environmental cues. It is also possible to alter the cue itself or to manipulate the developmental response physiologically so as to obtain alternative phenotypes. The relative fitness of these alternative phenotypes can then be measured in each relevant environment. However, these techniques will be most useful when combined with techniques such as phenotypic selection analysis to identify the specific traits under selection in natural populations. We illustrate these approaches using phytochrome-mediated "shade avoidance" responses in plants as a model system. We review the genetic and physiological mechanisms underlying these responses, illustrate how genetic manipulation can elucidate their adaptive value, and discuss the use of physiological manipulation to measure natural selection on plasticity in the wild.

The egg stage (duration 5-6 months) overwinters, larval development is brief (6-8 weeks) and adults undergo a protracted, prereproductive, summer diapause (up to 3 months) before mating and ovipositing in late September, about one week after the first appreciable fall of rain, but before surface water reappears in the streams after having been absent for about four months during the hot, dry summer. Comparison between this life cycle and those of more northerly populations reveals a latitude-correlated dine in phenology resembling that found in some other northern hemisphere odonates that, like L. viridis, maintain an obligatorily univoltine life cycle at different latitudes.																	0165-0424					JUL	1999	21	3					187	196		10.1076/aqin.21.3.187.4522								WOS:000082908400005						
J	Tammaru, T; Ruohomaki, K; Saloniemi, I				Tammaru, T; Ruohomaki, K; Saloniemi, I			Within-season variability of pupal period in the autumnal moth: A bet-hedging strategy?	ECOLOGY												Pupal period is highly variable in Epirrita autumnata (Lepidoptera, Geometridae) lasting from about one to over three months. We aimed to find proximate and ultimate explanations for the high variability, including the possibility that variation in eclosion time represents a diversified bet-hedging strategy, patterns of variation in pupal period, both among and within populations, were analyzed in several common environment experiments, including one with a half-sib design. We further assessed possible selective forces on eclosion date and its variance using an empirical simulation model. Latitudinal among-population differences in pupal period were shown to have a genetic basis. Within populations, there was a considerable among-sibship variance in this trait that suggests high heritabilities of pupal period. The environmental component of the variance was unlikely to result from a deterministic reaction norm, neither adaptive nor constraint-based, and may thus represent a type of variance on which a bet-hedging strategy can be based. Importantly, there were significant among-sibship differences in the variance itself, and a significant sire effect on offspring variability in the half-sib design. This suggests a possibility for the variance in pupal period to be selected for as such, and for increased random environmental variance (a bet-hedging strategy) to evolve via natural selection. We assumed that seasonal changes in night temperatures and predation rate determine the optimal timing of adult flight period in E. autumnata. Results of modeling suggested that there are apparently hat fitness profiles in relation to eclosion date, which is the probable reason for maintenance of high genetic diversity in pupal period. Unpredictable temperature during adult flight period has a potential to select for high variance in eclosion dates, although the selective pressure appears to be weak. Genetic variance in variance of pupal period may thus be largely selectively neutral in the studied system.

The aim here was to determine how accurate predictions of range change might be before entertaining global climatic change. Location Worldwide. Methods All the documented global biological control translocations of ladybirds (Coccinellidae: Chilocorus spp.) were analysed with the ecoclimatic program, CLIMEX. This program determines species distributions in relation to climate, and can be used to express the favourableness of different localities for a species. CLIMEX is also a useful exploratory tool for determining the likelihood of establishment of species introduced from one area to another. Results Predictive models were developed based on the likelihood of establishment of fifteen Chilocorus spp. relative to their physiological characteristics and climatic tolerances. This likelihood was compared with actual establishment with a resultant range of 0% accuracy to 100% accuracy. Only four (26.7%) species climatic tolerances could the predicted with 100% certainty. The general lack of accurate prediction was because climate is not always the overriding feature determining whether a species will establish or not. Other determinants, such as localized response to microclimate, phenology, host type and availability, presence of natural enemies and hibernation sites play a varying role over and above climate in determining whether a species will establish at a new locality. Main conclusions This study shows that even in the absence of climate change, range cannot always be determined, which means that most predictions of range change with climate change are likely to be wrong.

J	Roche, R; Jeuffroy, MH; Ney, B				Roche, R; Jeuffroy, MH; Ney, B			Comparison of different models predicting the date of beginning of flowering in pea (Pisum sativum L.)	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												In pea, the time of flowering is mainly related to the photoperiod (P) and mean temperature (T-m) during the vegetative period. In field conditions, both variables depend mainly on the latitude (LAT) and the date of sowing (RDS). On the basis of these four variables, several empirical models simulating the time to flowering either in days or in degree-days were calibrated (the parameters determined) and compared for pea (cv. Solara). Data were from trials in various locations throughout France over 8 years and with several sowing dates (from mid-November till mid-April). Surprisingly, the model with the more explicative variables (P and T-m) did not give the most reliable results in held conditions as assessed with a validation sample of situations including many years and locations. The best fit and MSEP (mean square error of prediction) were obtained by combining P, RDS and LAT in the model. Models can be constructed to use days or degree-days: models in days are very useful for crop management, whereas models in degree-days are well-adapted for crop modelling. The case of autumn sowings was analysed separately: models were recalibrated to give a good account of the whole range of sowing dates. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Iperti, G				Iperti, G			Biodiversity of predaceous coccinellidae in relation to bioindication and economic importance	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Their pioneering role in the development of biological pest control has rendered the Coccinellidae of great practical and scientific interest. About 90% of the approximately 4200 coccinellid species are considered beneficial because of their predatory activity, mainly against Homopterous insects and mites. Coccinellids live in all terrestrial ecosystems: tundra, forest, grassland, agrosystems, and from the plains to mountains. Knowledge of coccinellid life history requires investigation of their bio-ecology. Being holometabolous insects, coccinellids present all types of voltinism. They reproduce in different habitats and show a wide range of behaviours, from stenotropism to eurotropism. In spite of their polyphagy, adults tend to prefer certain types of food (or essential prey), which are eaten voraciously. Many aphidophagous and monovoltine coccinellid species migrate in response to unfavourable environmental conditions; however, in most cases adults endure hostile environmental changes by entering a temporary dormant state, i.e., hibernation, aestivation or aestivo-hibernation. Despite these adaptive behaviours, the coccinellids are very vulnerable to several Limiting factors, including natural enemies and anthropological influences. Therefore, many precautions must be taken throughout the year to protect them. Seasonal changes influence the occurrence of aphid outbreaks, the type of plant infested and the behaviour of coccinellids. Reciprocally, the species found in different geographic zones can be recruited as bioindicator insects owing to their climatic and trophic characteristics. In the context of biological control, the coccinellids represent an important cause of mortality of coccids, aphids and mites. The peculiar aggregation behaviour of coccinellids remains to be exploited for acclimatization of a new species in a new country. Their migratory abilities pose challenges and opportunities for the development of effective biological control programs against aphids. Future research on the genetics, physiology and behaviour of coccinellids combined with studies of their flight aerodynamics and interactions with agricultural ecosystems will undoubtedly lead to improvements in coccinellid-based aphid control programs.

The effect of temperature and P-O2 On the rate of oxygen consumption of T. brevicornis from a Scottish population was studied. As expected, V-O2 increased with increasing temperature over the range 5-30 degrees C. However, at 0 and 35 degrees C the rates of oxygen consumption were significantly lower than predicted. This was reflected in the very different values for Q(10) obtained over the temperature range 0-5 degrees C (due to T. brevicornis entering a dormant state at 0 degrees C) and 30-35 degrees C (due to high mortality at 35 degrees C), compared with the mean Q(10) of 2.9 for the temperature range 5-30 degrees C. Spectrophotometric studies of the body fluids of T. brevicornis failed to detect the presence of a respiratory pigment. Nevertheless, T. brevicornis was able to maintain its rates of oxygen consumption independent of P-O2 under conditions of declining oxygen tension. However, the ability of T. brevicornis to maintain respiratory independence under hypoxia was affected by temperature since the P-c was higher at 30 degrees C than at lower temperatures. T. brevicornis appears to be able to withstand exposure to low temperature and to severe hypoxia by entering a quiescent or dormant state during which its metabolic rate is significantly reduced.

J	Fielding, CA; Whittaker, JB; Butterfield, JEL; Coulson, JC				Fielding, CA; Whittaker, JB; Butterfield, JEL; Coulson, JC			Predicting responses to climate change: the effect of altitude and latitude on the phenology of the Spittlebug Neophilaenus lineatus	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												1. The phenology of Neophilaenus lineatus (Homoptera: Cercopidae) was studied along altitudinal and latitudinal transects in the UK. The response of the life cycle to these existing temperature gradients has been used to predict the likely effects of future climatic warming. 2. The date of spring egg hatch varied by a maximum of 4 weeks across the altitudinal gradient (440 m) and by 2 weeks in different years of the study. Autumn and winter temperatures do not determine hatching date because the eggs are in diapause during this period. It is only when the eggs terminate diapause in early spring that temperature differences between years and altitudes (or as a result of climatic warming) start to affect the date of egg hatch. 3. The delayed egg hatching with increasing altitude meant that the start of nymphal development was later at higher altitudes, The development rate of nymphs at higher altitudes was not significantly different from that at lower altitudes because the altitudinal lag in temperature was partially compensated for by the more advanced state of the season. Annual differences in spring and summer temperatures resulted in variations in nymphal development rate between years, with a 1 degrees C temperature rise shortening nymphal development by 3.5 days. 4, The appearance of adults was delayed by 5.6 days for every 100 m increase in altitude, largely as a consequence of the later egg hatch at higher altitudes. The later appearance of the adults at higher altitudes and in colder years, reduces the length of the potential oviposition period as females are killed by autumn frosts. Climatic warming would expand the length of the oviposition period and thus increase the upper altitude limits of N. lineatus. 5. A 4.5 degrees latitude difference within the UK appeared to have little effect on the timing of development in N. lineatus, possibly as a result of a geographical dine in temperature or photoperiod response. 6. Annual insects, such as N. lineatus, are likely to show a relatively small geographical displacement as a consequence of climatic warming. This is because of the temperature mitigating responses of diapause and the relative stability of the length of the development period over wide altitudinal and latitudinal ranges.																	0269-8463					JUN	1999	13			1			65	73		10.1046/j.1365-2435.1999.00009.x								WOS:000081662300009

In the Avignon population, the winter forms tested (diapausing generation) showed a greater tolerance to insecticide than the summer forms. High resistance rates, ranging from 25- to 180-fold, were observed for three organophosphorous insecticides. Resistance rates were seven limes lower for pyrethrinoids and amitraz and practically nil for carbamates. Inter-population resistance rates, for an identical period, were different for the three organo-phosphorous insecticides and for deltamethrin in two localities. However, it was difficult to make comparisons in time due to seasonal variations. Rates of synergism by S,S,S-tributyl phosphorotrithioate (DEF) and piperonyl butoxide (PBO) were low when applied 4 h before the insecticide (0.3- to 3.3-fold), except for deltamethrin with PBO (>60-fold).

In forced desynchrony, subjects are shielded from bright light and periodic time cues and are required to live on a day length outside the range of circadian entrainment. The work schedule used for most personnel aboard American submarines is 6 h on duty alternating with 12 h off duty. This imposed 18-h cycle is too short for human circadian synchronization, especially given that there is no bright-light exposure aboard submarines. However, crew members are exposed to 24-h stimuli that could mediate synchronization, such as clocks and social contacts with personnel who are living on a 24-h schedule. The authors investigated circadian rhythms of salivary melatonin in 20 crew members during a prolonged voyage on a Trident nuclear submarine. The authors found that in crew members living on the 18-h duty cycle, the endogenous rhythm of melatonin showed an average period of 24.35 h (n = 12, SD = 0.18 h). These data indicate that social contacts and knowledge of clock time are insufficient for entrainment to a 24-h period in personnel living by an 18-h rest-activity cycle aboard a submarine.

Net replacement rates and intrinsic rates of population increase were calculated fur resistant and susceptible populations. During the experiment, susceptible males on average copulated 13.3 +/- 1.5 times, whereas resistant males copulated only 8.0 +/- 1.0 times. Susceptible females produced an average of 824.2 +/- 68.1 eggs and 590.9 +/- 58.5 larvae, which was significantly >484.6 +/- 48.0 eggs and 334.9 +/- 39.7 larvae produced by an average resistant female. As a result, both net replacement rate and intrinsic rate of increase were reduced for the resistant population. Furthermore, twice as many susceptible beetles as resistant beetles survived overwintering diapause. Our results clearly indicate that relative fitness of resistant individuals is reduced in the absence of B. thurigiensis in the environment. Therefore, relaxation of selection pressure through region and insecticide rotation will favor decrease in the frequency of resistant alleles in beetle populations.																	0022-0493					JUN	1999	92	3					510	515		10.1093/jee/92.3.510								WOS:000081134100002						
J	Held, C; Spieth, HR				Held, C; Spieth, HR			First evidence of pupal summer diapause in Pieris brassicae L.: the evolution of local adaptedness	JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY												Pieris brassicae L. is adapted to a wide variety of local climates throughout the Palaeartic by means of geographic variation in daylengths and temperatures triggering winter diapause. We report for the first time a population from Sotogrande in southern Spain (strain S) that additionally exhibits a pronounced summer diapause in the pupal stage as a response to long daylengths. As well as having diapause triggered by long daylengths, this population develops directly at short, ecologically relevant daylengths. This unusual short-day type response is expressed at temperatures of 21 degrees C and above. The absence of cryptic summer diapause in a population from southern France indicates that this summer diapause evolved locally in Spain or Northern Africa in a population of P. brassicae which lacked this trait. The PPRs of strains S, H (Denmark) and B (France) and crosses between them suggest that summer diapause is inherited as a recessive allele which has a clinal decrease of frequency in populations northwards. The population from southern France shows that this simple pattern of inheritance is further modified by an unknown genetic mechanism controlling the expression of summer diapause near the border between aestivating and non-aestivating populations. On the basis of the photoperiodic response and climatic data we predict P. brassicae to have five or more generations each year in southern Spain. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Shintani, Y; Ishikawa, Y				Shintani, Y; Ishikawa, Y			Geographic variation in cold hardiness of eggs and neonate larvae of the yellow-spotted longicorn beetle Psacothea hilaris	PHYSIOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												Cold hardiness of eggs and neonate larvae of the yellow-spotted longicorn beetle, Psacothea hilaris (Pascoe) was examined using six geographical populations in Japan. Particular attention was paid to cold hardiness of eggs and neonate larvae of the subtropical population (Ishigaki), because the east Japan populations are considered to have been introduced from a subtropical area, and the overwintering stage in the east Japan populations is incidentally shifted from the original mature larval stage to the egg or neonate larval stages. When the eggs were exposed to low temperatures for Ih, the decrease in hatchability became significant at -12 degrees C in the southernmost two populations (Ishigaki and Naze), and at -16 degrees C in the northern populations. After Ih exposure to -20 degrees C, few eggs could hatch in the Ishigaki population, whereas 27-55% of the eggs survived in the northern populations. Pre-chilling of the eggs at 10 degrees C for 10 days enhanced the cold hardiness in all populations. This effect was particularly distinct in the subtropical population; the eggs of the Ishigaki population became as cold hardy as those of the northern populations after acclimation. These results suggest that the subtropical population is capable of establishing itself in east Japan, where the winter is cold.																	0307-6962					JUN	1999	24	2					158	164		10.1046/j.1365-3032.1999.00126.x								WOS:000080319100008

This braconid wasp may be a practical biological control factor for alfalfa and other seed crops, and further research is warranted. We found that P. howardi is a native species, is thelyotokous, has three generations per year, and produces some diapausing parasites in each generation. The geographic range of this species is not yet known. P howardi readily parasitized the eastern L. lineolaris in laboratory tests, so it is also a potential biocontrol agent for this related mirid species.																	0013-8746	1938-2901				MAY	1999	92	3					370	375		10.1093/aesa/92.3.370								WOS:000080577400008

The percentage of adults exhibiting prediapause increased seasonally, starting with the Ist generation in July and achieving a maximal rate of 98.7% late in the year. A greater proportion of males achieved diapause than females at any given time, except late in the season when convergence in the diapause response of both sexes occurred. These results suggest that individuals in a population have different thresholds of sensitivity to the environmental cues regulating the onset of diapause. Models described the percentage of males and females in prediapause as a function of Julian date of emergence and daylength on the day of emergence. The latter models have potential application over a wide region of the Cotton Belt.

Adults fed on growing tips, flowers, and pods of its host plant but oviposited only on seeds. Females avoided laying more than one or at most two eggs per seed even in the absence of other oviposition sites. One larva developed per seed and took approximately 14 days to completely consume the seed. They then changed to prepupae, which, in the field, stayed in their pod segments until the following wet season when they left the segment and pupated in the soil before emerging as adults. In the laboratory, few of these prepupae completed their development to adults despite having been provided with a range of environmental conditions to break diapause. Choice and no-choice tests on pods of 71 legume species showed that only M. pigra was acceptable for oviposition. Some adult feeding occurred on new growth of 10 species closely related to M. pigra but this does not diminish the safety of this insect for biological control as it will not oviposit and therefore complete its life cycle on these plants. Populations of C. serripes from Mexico, Venezuela, and Brazil all showed the same restriction to M. pigra. Permission to release this insect in Australia was obtained and it was first released in the Northern Territory during April 1996. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

Photoperiodic information is conveyed through several neural relays from the retina to the pineal gland where the light signal is translated into a daily cycle of melatonin secretion: high at night, low in the day. The length of the nocturnal secretion of melatonin reflects the duration of the night and it regulates the pulsatile secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus. Changes in GnRH release induce corresponding changes in luteinising hormone secretion which are responsible for the alternating presence or absence of ovulation in the female, and varying sperm production in the male. It is not yet known where and how this pineal indoleamine acts to exert this effect. Although melatonin binding sites are preferentially localised in the pars tuberalis (PT) of the adenohypophysis, the hypothalamus contains the physiological target sites of melatonin for its action on reproduction. Melatonin does not seem to act directly on GnRH neurons; rather it appears to involve a complex neural circuit of interneurons that includes at least dopaminergic, serotoninergic and excitatory aminoacidergic neurons.

The Zeitgeber period was stepwise reduced by 1 hr down to 22 hr or increased up to 26 hr. Within the range of entrainment, the phase angle Psi of a circadian rhythm with respect to light depends upon the period of Zeitgeber differently for the morning (M) and evening (E) peak: M is easier to advance, while E is easier to delay. Beyond the range of entrainment both peaks became free-running with some relative coordination. Masking (direct stimulation of activity by light) occurred only during the subjective night, and never in subjective day. In few cases one of two peaks became free-running while its counterpart remained entrained, suggesting that each of the two peaks has its own visual input and can be entrained by light. These results are in agreement with the difference in the PRC shape for the M and E peaks, and support the hypothesis that M and E peaks are controlled by two functionally separate oscillators that have polar different properties, and are extremely strongly mutually coupled with phases locked at about 180 degrees.																	0929-1016					APR	1999	30	2					113	122		10.1076/brhm.30.2.113.1425								WOS:000081620300001

Rhagoletis pomonella has been controversial since the 1860's when Benjamin Walsh cited the fly's shift from hawthorn (Crataegus spp.) to apple (Malus pumila) as an example of an incipient sympatric speciation event. Allozyme and mark-release-recapture studies have subsequently confirmed the status of apple and hawthorn flies as partially reproductively isolated and genetically differentiated 'host races', the hypothesized initial stage in sympatric divergence. Here, we review the ecological and genetic evidence for host-plant mediated selection in R. pomonella. We reach the following three major conclusions: First, although developmental timing is not everything, it is a good deal of the story. Differences in the fruiting phenologies of apple and hawthorn trees exert different selection pressures on the diapause and eclosion time characteristics of the host races. In particular, the similar to 3-week earlier mean fruiting phenology of apples in eastern North America appears to select for a slower rate of metabolism or deeper pupal diapause in apple than hawthorn flies. Second, host-related fitness trade-offs for R. pomonella may not be due to disruptive selection affecting any one specific life-history stage. Rather, it is the sum total of directional selection pressures acting across different life-stages that generates divergent selection on apple and hawthorn flies. For example, selection favors the alleles Me 100, Acon-2 95 and Mpi 37 (or linked genes) in the larval stage in both host races. However, these same alleles are disfavored in the pupal stage to follow, where they correlate with early adult eclosion, and by inference premature diapause termination. Because apple trees fruit an average of similar to 3 weeks earlier than hawthorn trees, this counter-balancing selection is stronger on apple-fly pupae. The net result is that the balance of selective forces is different between apple and hawthorn flies, helping to maintain the genetic integrity of the host races in sympatry in the face of gene flow. Finally, natural R. pomonella populations harbor a good deal of genetic variation for development-related traits. This variation allows fly populations to rapidly respond to temporal vagaries in local environmental conditions across years, as well as to broad-scale geographic differences that exist across the range of the species. Perhaps most importantly, this variation gives R. pomonella the flexibility to explore and adapt to novel plants. Taken together, our results underscore how difficult it can be to document host plant-related fitness trade-offs for phytophagous insects due to the need to consider details of the entire life-cycle of a phytophagous insect. Our findings also show how reproductive isolation can arise as a by-product of host-associated adaptation in insects, a central theme for models of sympatric speciation via host shifts.																	0013-8703					APR	1999	91	1					211	225		10.1046/j.1570-7458.1999.00486.x								WOS:000081679300029						
J	Ishihara, M; Shimada, M				Ishihara, M; Shimada, M			Geographical variation in photoperiodic response for diapause induction between univoltine and multivoltine populations of Kytorhinus sharpianus (Coleoptera : Bruchidae)	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												The northern Aomori (univoltine) and southern Mitsuma (multivoltine) populations of the bruchid beetle, Kytorhinus sharpianus (Bridwell), were reciprocally transplanted. The incidence of diapause was significantly different between the northern (88.9%) and southern populations (0%) at the southern location. The critical photoperiods for diapause induction at the late 4th instar were determined in 4 latitudinally separated populations at 24 degrees C. The critical photoperiod increased from 14.5:9.5 to 15.2:8.8 (L:D) h toward the north. The difference in the incidence of diapause between the Aomori and Mitsuma populations at the southern location can be explained by the difference in the critical photoperiod. However, the photoperiodic response curve in the northern univoltine population (Aomori) was shallower than that in the southern multivoltine populations (Obanazawa, Kujiranami, and Mitsuma). In addition, the variation in the photoperiodic response within the univoltine Aomori population was larger than within the multivoltine Mitsuma population. These large differences in the photoperiodic response curve and its variation may be explained by a large change in natural selection of the critical photoperiod between the univoltine and multivoltine populations.																	0046-225X	1938-2936				APR	1999	28	2					195	200		10.1093/ee/28.2.195								WOS:000080061800008

Theory suggests that the optimum temperature for development, the maximum development rate, and the range of temperatures over which development occurs, are adapted to local temperature regimes. To test this hypothesis, spruce budworm populations from locations spanning a 15 degrees range in latitude were reared on artificial diet, at 10 different constant temperatures ranging From 9.3 to 33 degrees C. However, these experiments yielded no evidence for adaptation in parameters controlling development rate. It is suggested that migration by egg laying moths undermines processes that might select for individuals adapted to local temperature regimes. Rapid development seen in northern populations of the spruce budworm is not apparently explained by thermal adaptations but might, instead, result from effects of photoperiod on feeding behavior.																	0046-225X					APR	1999	28	2					224	232		10.1093/ee/28.2.224								WOS:000080061800013						
J	Pavlostathis, SG; Jackson, GH				Pavlostathis, SG; Jackson, GH			Biotransformation of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene in Anabaena sp. cultures	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												The transformation of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) was investigated in cultures of the cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. by conducting a series of batch assays. 2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene was added to Anabaena sp. cultures in single and consecutive additions, at various initial concentrations, to determine its transformation kinetics, to identify products formed, to evaluate potential toxicity, and to determine the effect of light deprivation on the TNT transformation process. 2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene disappearance occurred only in the presence of Anabaena sp. cultures maintained under a normal 16-h photoperiod. Toxicity leading to culture chlorosis and death was observed in batch systems with an initial TNT concentration greater than 10 mg/L. A low rate and extent of TNT disappearance was observed in light-deprived cultures, which were inhibited even at low TNT concentrations (i.e., <4 mg/L). At pH values between 7.5 and 8.5, azoxy-tetranitrotoluene isomers were detected in both the culture medium and solvent extracts of biomass and accounted for only 20 and 4.4% of the initially added TNT moles, respectively. At a culture pH range between 5.6 and 5.9, achieved by aeration with a 5% CO2/air mixture, hydroxylaminodinitrotoluene equimolar to the TNT addition was produced and then depleted from the culture medium with prolonged incubation. Although TNT reduction in Anabaena sp. cultures occurred, yielding low levels of azoxy-tetranitrotoluene isomers or hydroxylaminodinitrotoluene (depending on the culture pH conditions), uptake and other transformation reactions of TNT and/or its transformation products by Anabaena sp. may have taken place. Based on a less than 15% observed increase of biomass concentration over the relatively short incubation periods (usually <6 h) and by considering the mean biomass concentration constant, the TNT disappearance rate followed pseudo-first-order kinetics. The biomass carbon-normalized TNT disappearance rates in Anabaena sp. cultures were about three orders of magnitude higher than previously reported TNT disappearance rates obtained in batch cultures of aquatic plants.																	0730-7268					MAR	1999	18	3					412	419										WOS:000078658100007

Location Collection sites were located in the central and eastern United States ranging from western Oklahoma to northern New York. Methods We collected 872 M. immaculatus is larvae from thirty-four collecting sites. At each site, we randomly sampled ant lion pits and collected between fifteen and fifty-two larvae in total. Larvae were preserved in 95% ETOH for morphological analysis and frozen in a -80 degrees C freezer for protein electrophoresis. We measured the body size of eighty-five preserved adult M. immaculatus obtained from museum collections using head width as an indicator of body size. Five enzymes [GPI (glucose phosphate isomerase), MDH (malate dehydrogenase), PEP (peptidase), DIA (diaphorase) and SOD (superoxide dismutase)] were used in the heterozygosity analyses. Results Larval and adult body size increased with latitude, bur decreased with elevation. Average heterozygosity, measured at five polymorphic loci, also increased significantly with latitude. Minimum temperature variance was the best predictor of body size, whereas precipitation and maximum temperature were the best predictors of heterozygosity. Populations were genetically differentiated from one another and showed a pattern of isolation by distance, as measured by Wright's F-st values and Nei's genetic distances. Main conclusions Sampling artifacts, heat conservation, character displacement, cell-size variation, density-dependent mortality, and differential dispersal probably cannot account for latitudinal variation in ant lion body size. Our results implicate the importance of diurnal photoperiod, which varies with latitude, but not with elevation. Because photoperiod often controls growth, diapause, and metamorphosis, it may be an important determinant of latitudinal dines in body size and life history of insects.																	0305-0270	1365-2699				MAR	1999	26	2					275	283		10.1046/j.1365-2699.1999.00271.x								WOS:000081618000007						
J	Reinert, HK; Rupert, RR				Reinert, HK; Rupert, RR			Impacts of translocation on behavior and survival of timber rattlesnakes, Crotalus horridus	JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY												The impact of translocation on timber rattlesnakes (Crotalus horridus) was assessed experimentally by moving 11 specimens distances of between 8 km and 172 km away from their native populations and releasing them into a study area having a resident rattlesnake population. All translocated snakes were equipped with radio transmitters, and their behavior, survival, and interaction with resident snakes were observed. Eighteen resident snakes were also telemetrically monitored during the four-year study. Six of the 11 (54.5%) translocated snakes are known to have died while only 2 of the 18 (11.1%) resident snakes experienced mortality during the period they were radiotracked. Of the six translocated specimens that died, three experienced overwinter mortality despite their location of resident hibernacula, two were killed by predators, and one died from disease. The mean daily survival rate of translocated snakes (0.9973) was significantly lower than that of resident snakes (0.9993). Translocated snakes selected habitats similar to that of residents, foraged successfully, and maintained body mass. However, translocated snakes exhibited atypical movement patterns consisting of extensive and long-distance traveling. The six translocated male rattlesnakes averaged 15,017 m (SE = 2184.3) in total distance traveled from release until hibernation with daily movements of 123.8 m (SE = 19.40) and convex polygon activity range areas of 600.6 ha (SE = 253.0). Comparatively, the total active season distance traveled by the seven resident male rattlesnakes averaged only 5575 m (SE = 936.5) with mean daily movements of 36.9 m (SE = 5.36) and convex polygon activity ranges of 59.9 ha (SE = 13.04). Mean activity parameters 3 to 5 times larger than those of resident snakes were also typical for translocated female rattlesnakes. Translocated snakes located active hibernacula apparently by following resident snakes; however, their overwintering mortality was higher than that of residents. Translocated snakes that successfully survived the first overwinter period continued to exhibit more extensive movements in their second active season than did residents. However, there was evidence of the establishment of a more resident-like pattern of movement among these specimens during the second year. Translocation of adult snakes is not recommended as a standard conservation practice because of its immediate and long-term negative impacts.																	0022-1511					MAR	1999	33	1					45	61		10.2307/1565542								WOS:000079103200008						
J	Lovett, GM; Thompson, AW; Anderson, JB; Bowser, JJ				Lovett, GM; Thompson, AW; Anderson, JB; Bowser, JJ			Elevational patterns of sulfur deposition at a site in the Catskill Mountains, New York	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												In this paper we report measurements of SO42- - fluxes in throughfall and bulk deposition across an elevational transect from 800 to 1275 m on Slide Mountain in the Catskill Mountains of southeastern New York State. The net throughfall flux of SO42- (throughfall-bulk deposition), which we attribute to cloud and dry deposition, increased by roughly a factor of 13 across this elevational range. Part of the observed increase results from the year-round exposure of evergreen foliage at the high-elevation sites, compared to the lack of foliage in the dormant season in the deciduous canopies at low elevations. Comparison of the net throughfall flux with estimates of cloud deposition suggests that both cloud deposition and dry deposition increased with elevation. Dry deposition estimates from a nearby monitoring site fall within the measured range of net throughfall flux for SO42-. The between-site variation in net throughfall flux was very high at the high-elevation sites, and less so at the lower sites, suggesting that studies of atmospheric deposition at high-elevations will be complicated by extreme spatial variability in deposition rates. Studies of atmospheric deposition in mountainous areas of the eastern U.S. have often emphasized cloud water deposition, but these results suggest that elevational increases in dry deposition may also be important.

Foraging behaviour and movement within and among host patches of the specialist parasitoid wasp Cotesia melitaearum (Braconidae) attacking the larvae of Melitaea cinxia (Nymphalidae) were studied in the field and in the laboratory. 2. In the field, female wasps aggregated in large host groups in the autumn and caused positive spatial density-dependent parasitism in the field. Wasps stayed longer with groups of pre-diapause caterpillars than with post-diapause caterpillars, but attacked them less frequently. 3. In the laboratory, wasps attacked larger larvae more readily than smaller larvae. Also in the laboratory, wasps exposed to larvae outside their protective webs showed differences in the rates at which they attacked larvae fed different diets, implicating host plant-derived chemicals as proximate cues for foraging wasps. 4. Mark-recapture studies indicated that there was a low rate of successful movement of wasps among groups of young larvae within a habitat patch in the autumn and no successful movement of wasps across non-habitat. In contrast, wasps moved frequently among groups of late-instar caterpillars in the spring. 5. Host caterpillars of different ages responded very differently to wasp attacks. Pre-diapause larvae remained in groups and used collective head-jerking behaviour to defend themselves, whereas post-diapause larvae dispersed away from the group immediately after being attacked. 6. Population and metapopulation level dynamics of the host-parasitoid interaction are discussed in light of these observations of the behaviour of individual wasps.																	0307-6946	1365-2311				FEB	1999	24	1					59	72		10.1046/j.1365-2311.1999.00167.x								WOS:000078884500007

Such trade-offs are central to models of sympatric speciation via host shifts, but have proven difficult to empirically demonstrate. Here, we test for host-plant dependent selection on larvae of apple (Malus pumila L.) and hawthorn (Crataegus mollis L. spp.)-infesting races of Rhagoletis pomonella (Walsh). Samples of larvae were reared in the field and under protective conditions in a garage. Our rationale was that the garage should slow rates of fruit rot relative to the field, relaxing selection pressures associated with declining fruit quality. Four findings emerged from the study. (1) Larvae suffered higher mortality in fruits in the field than the garage. (2) The increase in mortality was greater for larvae in haws. (3) Larvae possessing the alleles Me 100, Acon-2 95, and Mpi 37, three allozymes displaying host-related differentiation in R. pomonella that map to linkage group II in the fly, left fruits earlier than other genotypes. (4) Allele frequencies for Me 100, Acon-2 95, and Mpi 37 were significantly higher in both apple and haw larvae surviving the field versus the garage treatment. Our results suggested that field conditions favored larvae that rapidly developed and left rotting fruits. Since these individuals tended to possess the alleles Me 100, Acon-2 95, and Mpi 37, frequencies of these allozymes were higher in the field. Selection on larvae was directional for Me 100, Acon-2 95, and Mpi 37 (or linked genes) in both host races. We previously showed that these same alleles can be disfavored in the pupal stage, especially in the apple race, where they correlate with premature diapause termination. Fitness trade-offs in Rhagoletis may therefore be due as much to differences in the relative strengths of directional selection pressures acting on different life stages as to disruptive selection affecting any one particular stage. The necessity to consider details of the entire life-cycle highlights one of the many challenges posed to documenting fitness trade-offs for phytophagous insects.																	0014-3820					FEB	1999	53	1					187	200		10.2307/2640931								WOS:000078927800017	28565200					
J	Schonrogge, K; Walker, P; Crawley, MJ				Schonrogge, K; Walker, P; Crawley, MJ			Complex life cycles in Andricus kollari (Hymenoptera, Cynipidae) and their impact on associated parasitoid and inquiline species	OIKOS												The cynipid gall wasp Andricus kollari was introduced to southwestern Britain in the middle of the nineteenth century and has since spread throughout the British Isles. A. kollari produces a sexual generation in spring on Turkey oak (Quercus cei ris; an introduced tree in Britain) and a parthenogenetic generation in autumn on the native oak species Q. robur and Q. petraea. The galls of the two generations differ considerably in size (< 5 mm in diameter in the spring galls and up to 30 mm for the autumn galls). In 1994 and 1995 we sampled eight populations of A. kollari at sites from the south of England to the north of Scotland. The females of the autumn generation emerged in two cohorts: one in the autumn of the year of gall induction and the second in the spring of the following year. The second cohort of parthenogenetic females, however, emerges when the spring galls, containing the next sexual generation, are already fully developed. Eggs laid by the females of the second cohort thus cannot contribute to that spring generation, but slay dormant in the buds of Turkey oak and hatch as the spring generation a pear later. The proportion of females of this second cohort increased from south to north, and in the north of Scotland the populations densities of A. kollari showed substantial differences between years, consistent with a two-year life cycle. Here we study the effects the different gall properties and the geographical variation of a complex phenology have on the communities of parasitoids, inquilines and predators associated with A. kollari. We measured predation rates by birds and parasitoid attack in the galls of both generations. While there was an increasing tendency towards a two-year life cycle from the south to the north, bird predation rates on the spring galls decreased in 1994 from > 50% in the south to less than 5% in the north. Similarly, parasitoid abundance in the autumn galls decreased from an average of 6 individuals per gall in the south to 1 per gall in the north (in contrast to the spring galls, the autumn galls are sufficiently large to contain inquilines and can yield more than one individual per gall). Parasitism rates in the spring galls showed no geographical trend in 1994, but a clear decrease from south to north in 1995. This year, 1995, was a high-density year in the north, which suggests a satiation effect whereby the parasitoid species cannot follow the sudden increase in the host population.

The biological equator in man	CHRONOBIOLOGY INTERNATIONAL												There is extensive literature describing the effect of season on mortality rates, especially in cardiovascular and respiratory disease. This study compares latitude with the extent of seasonal variation of monthly deaths from all causes. In developed countries, there is a peak of deaths in winter and a trough in summer. Monthly numbers of deaths were established in 89 countries in the Northern and Southern Hemisphere. Using cosinor analysis, the extent of seasonal variation (amplitude) was established and correlated with latitude. The amplitude of seasonality was greatest in mid-latitude around 35 degrees, but low or absent near the equator and subpolar regions. The amplitude can differ at the same latitude. The weather in equatorial regions and in habitations near the Arctic Circle is very different, but death has a similar seasonal rhythm. The purpose is to record this epidemiological finding even though no simple explanation is provided. Weather alone cannot explain it, and it is possible that day length (photoperiod) has an important, but complex, underlying role.																	0742-0528						1999	16	2					199	212		10.3109/07420529909019086								WOS:000079820900007	10219491					
J	Maun, MA; Perumal, J				Maun, MA; Perumal, J			Zonation of vegetation on lacustrine coastal dunes: effects of burial by sand	ECOLOGY LETTERS												More than 50 pears ago it was proposed that zonation of major plant species on coastal dunes was determined by salt spray. Were, we argue against this hypothesis because (i) salt concentrations rarely exceed toxic levels; (ii) high precipitation in temperate latitudes washes the salt off the plants; (iii) major salt spray events occur in late autumn and winter when plants are dormant; and (iv) zonation also occurs on lacustrine dunes. Instead, we show evidence that zonation may be caused by burial because plant distribution was correlated with Sand deposition and species were eliminated when burial exceeded their limits of tolerance, thus creating zones of different plant species. We conclude that in temperate regions (i) burial bf sand may be among the most important factors in zonation, while salt spray may play a secondary role; and (ii) single environmental factors cannot br the determinants of a phenomenon as complex as species zonation.																	1461-023X					JAN	1999	2	1					14	18		10.1046/j.1461-0248.1999.21048.x								WOS:000078485600005

In Europe, its range covers > 25 degrees of latitude where it lives under a variety of climates that vary from extreme oceanic in the west, to continental in the east. Colonies nest in the soil and their life cycles are known to be highly dependent on ambient temperature and soil moisture. We hypothesised that the brood-rearing behaviour of populations might be focally adapted to climate and that we might detect differences when the ants were reared under "common-garden" conditions. Brood-rearing behaviour was compared for 38 colonies of M. rubra drawn from 13 populations representing a range of 6 latitudes: all 6 were represented in eastern Europe and 2 in western Europe. A sample of ants from each colony was used to estimate respiration rate, body mass and fat content at the start of the experiment in spring (immediately post hibernation) and at the end of the experiment (mid summer). Respiration had a linear relationship with latitude, with northern populations having greater respiration rate in spring compared to southern populations. It is suggested that this is an adaptation to different seasonality over the species' range that results in the "more active" northern workers rearing fewer brood to maturity more quickly than southern workers. Fat content, a measure of worker "quality", had a parabolic relationship with latitude with mid latitude colonies having the fattest workers. Fatter workers appeared to rear heavier brood. This probably represented a functional response to environment with populations living at "edge of range" sites being physiologically more stressed and performing brood-rearing tasks less well than centre of range populations. We believe that this is the first demonstration of a consistent, intra-specific trend for Variation in the social physiology of an ant species over its geographic range.

Permanent parthenogens survive as parthenogenetic females in mild winters, but are regularly eliminated by low temperatures; while cyclical parthenogens, which switch to sexual reproduction by the end of summer, produce every year fertilised diapausing eggs resistant to frost. We have studied the variation in sexual morph production of several clones of the cereal aphid Rhopalosiphum padi (L.) showing both strategies. Twenty clones of this species differing by their geographic origin and their mode of reproduction were placed in two laboratory environments mimicking the changes of photoperiod and thermoperiod occurring naturally from the end of summer and during the autumn in oceanic and continental conditions. The analysis of clonal responses in both climatic conditions showed (i) a wide variation in investment of clones in sexual reproduction with, in particular, evidence for a mixed strategy employed by clones producing both sexuals without ceasing parthenogenetic reproduction, (ii) no geographic adaptation among clones belonging to cyclical parthenogenetic populations, (iii) an earlier production of sexuals in continental conditions and a higher production of males in oceanic conditions. Furthermore, we have compared the dates of first appearance of sexuals in our experiments with those occurring in the field based on a suction trap database and found that sexuals were caught in nature at least four weeks earlier than in the lab. These results underline the need for a better understanding of the influence of the whole array of environmental factors inducing the transition from parthenogenetic to sexual reproduction in aphids.

J	Kodrik, D; Socha, R				Kodrik, D; Socha, R			A Mediterranean population of Pyrrhocoris apterus (Heteroptera : Pyrrhocoridae) exhibits wing morph-related differences in adipokinetic response	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY												Short-winged (brachypterous) and long-winged (macropterous) adult females of Pyrrhocoris apterus (L.) originating from a Mediterranean population (Israel) were analyzed for their adipokinetic responses. The adipokinetic response, expressed as an increase of haemolymph lipids after injection of adipokinetic hormone from Locusta migratoria (Lom-AKH-I), was assessed in relation to age and dose of the hormone. We demonstrate in this study that the adipokinetic responses induced by bug's corpora cardiaca extract and Lom-AKH-I were dose-dependent for both brachypterous and macropterous females. Significant differences between the morphs were recorded for doses greater than or equal to 0.25 corpora cardiaca equivalent (P < 0.01) and doses greater than or equal to 0.25 pmol Lom-AKH-I (P < 0.05). The haemolymph lipid elevations induced in both morphs by 2 pmols Lom-AKH-I are comparable with that induced by crude extract of one pair of the bug's own corpora cardiaca. The age-dependent test showed much higher adipokinetic responses (P < 0.01) in macropterous females (greater than or equal to 5 days old) than in the brachypterous females of the same age, when treated with 2 pmols Lom-AKH-I. Starting from day 7, the concentration of haemolymph lipids was also considerably higher (2.5-5 times) in macropterous females than in the brachypterous ones. The obtained data indicate that difference in mobilization of lipids between brachypterous and macropterous females is a geographically independent feature and represents a true wing morph characteristic of P, apterus.

J	Kerr, JT				Kerr, JT			Weak links: 'Rapoport's rule' and large-scale species richness patterns	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY												Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain regional species richness patterns. Among these, 'Rapoport's rule' has sparked considerable controversy by stating that the latitudinal gradient in species richness can be explained indirectly as a function of narrower geographic ranges for species at low latitudes. Annual climatic variability, or deviation from mean climatic conditions, has been hypothesized to moderate this phenomenon. Furthermore, taxa that avoid much of this seasonality, such as temperate zone insects that enter diapause or species that migrate, were predicted to show reduced latitudinal gradients in richness. I test the suggested link between 'Rapoport's rule' and species richness for two higher level insect taxa as well as for the class Mammalia. Although these taxa exhibit the well-known latitudinal gradient in species richness, simple annual climatic variability and deviation from mean annual climatic conditions provide very poor predictions of species richness in each of them. Potential evapotranspiration, a measurement of ambient climatic energy, explains most of the observed variance in regional species richness patterns for all three tars, consistent with the species richness-energy hypothesis. I fmd no support for an indirect link between 'Rapoport's rule' and terrestrial species richness patterns in North America.																	0960-7447					JAN	1999	8	1					47	54		10.1046/j.1365-2699.1999.00315.x								WOS:000082488500006						
J	Felke, M; Buschinger, A				Felke, M; Buschinger, A			Social organization, reproductive behavior and ecology of Leptothorax acervorum (Hymenoptera, Formicidae) from the Sierra de Albarracin in central Spain	INSECTES SOCIAUX												Leptothorax acervorum, an ant species with holarctic range, occurs in an isolated population in the Spanish Sierra de Albarracin. Dissection of dealate females and laboratory observations revealed that in contrast to other European populations, the colonies are monogynous, with one reproductive queen each and a variable number of virgin or mated dealate but not laying females. Most of the latter probably just hibernate in the mother nests, leaving them in the following spring, but a few remain there for longer time, without reproducing. Such colonies then are functionally monogynous. Alate females exhibit a stationary sexual calling, and mating behavior could be studied in the laboratory. Mated females return to the mother nest where they soon shed wings. When developing fertility before or after hibernation they are evicted from the nests; in nature they probably form daughter colonies. Patchy habitat and rough climatic conditions in the Sierra de Albarracin may be responsible for the particular reproductive behavior of L. acervorum in this area. The generally small size difference between queens and workers in the subgenus Leptothorax entails high costs of dispersal and colony foundation by single queens who have to forage for their first brood. Some kind of dependent colony foundation therefore is frequently met with in the subgenus. Notwithstanding the marked biological and a few slight morphological differences between central European L. acervorum and the Spanish population its taxonomic status as yet is unsettled. We refer to this population provisionally as "L. acervorum Albarracin".																	0020-1812						1999	46	1					84	91		10.1007/s000400050117								WOS:000079081700014

By rearing bees in a greenhouse in Matsue (lat. 35 degrees 29', alt. 170 m), south-western Japan, it was revealed that the bees had an eusocial life cycle with 2 distinctly discrete brood rearing periods, i.e., a solitary phase in spring and an eusocial phase in summer. The life cycle and sociality were of the same pattern as those at Mt. Daisen (lat. 35 degrees 22'. alt. 800-1000 m), 50 km from Matsue, where females reared in the greenhouse were collected. On the other hand in Sapporo (lat. 43 degrees 03', alt. 20 m), northern Japan, the solitary life cycle was suggested by a phenological survey. The effective accumulative temperature was compared for each locality, as an index of local thermal condition. The accumulative value at Mt. Daisen and Sapporo did not differ. The fact suggests that short flying season at high latitudes, such as in Sapporo does not induce the solitary life cycle in L. apristum. Approximately 39% of workers in the eusocial colonies at Matsue had well-developed ovaries, suggesting that they were possible egg-layers. No clear proof of the allocation of foraging in relation to the size and age of workers was obtained. Uninseminated, small, worker-sized females were also produced together with new queens at autumn at Mt. Daisen. Hibernation by these uninseminated females was suggested. The size-linked color patterns of the metasoma were recognized among the pre-hibernating females at both localities.																	0020-1812						1999	46	3					224	232		10.1007/s000400050138								WOS:000082168000005

Heartbeat patterns in these pupae consist of three different types of activity: Continuous forward-pulse periods of different duration with a frequency range of about 0.25-0.52 s(-1), continuous backward-pulse periods with lower frequencies (0.15-0.29 s(-1)) and intermittent backward-pulse periods when short series of three to 10 single heartbeats at frequencies of 0.12-0.35 s(-1) alternated with heart pauses of 2-10 min. CO2 release was discontinuous (CFO-type) from about four to 12 days after pupation in Troides rhadamantus and from about four to 18 days in Ornithoptera priamus. Mean CO2 release rates were very low in both species (10-30 nmol g(-1) min(-1)). After this period, heart pauses occurred more frequently, probably indicating the onset of metamorphosis and the beginning partial histolysis of the heart. Infrared-optical and thermometrical measurements of heartbeat indicated that haemolymph transport within the dorsal vessel in forward direction is more effective than in backward direction. This is deduced from the higher heartbeat frequency and heartbeat amplitude of the forward pulsations. Results from ultrasonic doppler velocimetry suggest that haemolymph flow velocity is highest during the relatively long diastasis of 2-3 s (30-40 mm s(-1)), while minimum particle speed (about 20 mm s(-1)) is at the end of systole and the beginning of diastole. This would mean that haemolymph velocity is highest between two consecutive peristaltic waves. In contrast to the haemolymph velocity, the speed of the peristaltic wave measured with the infrared transmission technique was lower (about 8.4-22 mm s(-1) in Troides, 10-23 mm s(-1) in Ornithoptera) and remained constant during forward pulse periods. During backward beating the speed was lower (8-20 mm s(-1) in Troides, 9-17 mm s(-1) in Ornithoptera) and decreased during backward pulse periods. During day two to seven in Troides and day three to nine in Ornithoptera, spiracular opening periods coincided with changes in heartbeat direction from backward to forward pulsations. A possible influence is the more efficient convective haemolymph mixing in the haemocoel during forward heartbeat. The mixing allows to bring the haemolymph in close contact with the tracheal system where the discharge of CO2 takes place. Heartbeat may therefore serve for shortening the diffusion pathways for a rapid transition into the tracheal system during the open period of the spiracles. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Williams, LM; Hannah, LT; Bassett, JM				Williams, LM; Hannah, LT; Bassett, JM			Melatonin receptors in neonatal pig brain and pituitary gland	JOURNAL OF PINEAL RESEARCH												Summer infertility remains a major problem ip domestic pigs. It has been proposed that sows which display this trait are inherent seasonal breeders. The influence of photoperiod on domestic pigs has been difficult to ascertain as significant diurnal fluctuations in blood levels of the pineal hormone, melatonin, which provide a direct neuroendocrine transduction of the ambient photoperiod in other species, remain questionable in adult pigs. To investigate whether the pig is potentially receptive to melatonin, central sites of action for this hormone were localized and characterized within the brain and pituitary of the neonatal pig by in vitro autoradiography using 2-(I-125)iodomelatonin. Specific binding was distributed over a number of discrete regions of the brain including the cerebral cortex, hypothalamus, thalamus, brainstem, and cerebellum The choroid plexus, and the pars tuberalis and pars distalis of the pituitary were also specifically labeled. Specific binding was completely abolished in the presence of 10(-7) M melatonin, and inhibited in the presence of 10(-4) M GTP gamma S (guanosine-5-0-(3-thiotriphosphate)), a non-hydrolysable analogue of GTP, in all regions examined, indicating that binding is representative of a G-protein coupled receptor. Characterization studies showed that 2-(I-125)iodomelatonin binding was saturable with a dissociation constant (K-d) in the low picomolar range (approximate to 30 pM). Competition studies with iodomelatonin, melatonin, N-acetylserotonin and serotonin (5-HT) gave IC50 values similar to those previously characterized for the melatonin receptor in the ovine pars tuberalis.																	0742-3098	1600-079X				JAN	1999	26	1					43	49		10.1111/j.1600-079X.1999.tb00565.x								WOS:000079019800006	10102759

Life cycle traits are intimately associated with reproductive success, and yet a high degree of phenotypic variability is sometimes observed. Unfortunately, it is normally not known whether this variability is based on genetic differences among individuals or on phenotypic plasticity. A high degree of phenotypic variability was observed in the diapause response of the burnet moth Zygaena trifolii (ESPER, 1783) (Lepidoptera, Zygaenidae). It is a "long-day insect" with temperature-influenced photoperiodic responses, and larval diapause may occur at the 3rd or any subsequent larval instar. The observed variability is partly based on genetic differences between individuals. In a selection experiment, the larval instar at which diapause occurs,vas changed within six generations. Diapause instars were dependent on the time of pre-diapause development of larvae, which varied considerably between larvae. A part of the variability in development time is based on additive genetic variance. Genetic variability in life cycle traits closely associated with reproductive success is normally eroded by strong natural selection on such traits. One may speculate, that the maintenance of genetic variability in the diapause response of Z. trifolii may result from temporal changes in selection pressure close to the border of the distribution range, where unsuitable weather conditions prevent successful reproduction in some years.																	0344-9084						1999	12	1-6					595	598										WOS:000089179800120

The Fat-tailed Dwarf Lemur (C. medius) is found throughout the west and south of Madagascar and enters torpor for six to eight months. Such a long period of dormancy may influence their social organization. A 20-month field Study carried out at the Station Forestiure d'Ampijoroa revealed a monogamous social pattern for C. medius. Data from this study are presented on group composition, sleeping associations, and home range organization over two seasons in order to elucidate the basis of C. medius' unusual social organization. All studied groups contained one adult pair and their offspring from one or more birth seasons. Members of a group regularly sleep together, which might be an important means of social contact. In groups containing more than one offspring, brothers and sisters had the closest relationship. The adult pair remain together within the same home range for more than one season and presumably for life. Subsequently, some hypotheses about when monogamy should evolve are discussed.																			0-306-46187-0				1999							139	157										WOS:000089018300008

Carr.)	PHYSIOLOGY AND GENETICS OF TREE-PHYTOPHAGE INTERACTIONS - INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM	COLLOQUES DE L INRA				International Symposium on Physiology and Genetics of Tree-Phytophage Interactions	AUG 31-SEP 05, 1997	GUJAN, FRANCE	INRA, Int Union Forestry Res Org				There is accumulating evidence that the origins of Sitka spruce Picea sitchensis (provenance or genetic family) play an important role in determining the population dynamics of the green spruce aphid Elatobium abietinum. Genetic variability in P.sitchensis makes it a good candidate for tree breeding, although recent genetic gains in 'super-Sitka' have not accounted for pest resistance explicitly. This paper reviews two studies, 11 years apart, on the aphid populations of P.sitchensis provenances in the same experimental field demonstration. The trends in susceptibility of the provenances were consistent, with the exception of the slowest growing and most northerly provenance. There were relationships between the latitudinal origins of provenances and their aphid loads; in general it was the most vigorously growing provenances that proved to be the most resistant to aphids, There are recorded differences between P.sitchensis provenances in the time of shoot growth cessation and budset in late summer and autumn. An hypothesis that earlier dormancy was linked with greater nutrient availability for aphids, was not supported by data on the levels of amino acids in needles in October. In fact total amino nitrogen was inversely related to the summer aphid population hosted by each provenance and most essential amino acids were at very low levels. Together with the similarity in budburst phenology among provenances, this suggested that factors other than nutrients are responsible for the differences in provenance susceptibility. The green spruce aphid is thought to avoid some species of spruce and also new foliage by responding to volatile compounds in epicuticular wax at the needle leaf surface. A resistance mechanism based on secondary metabolites would correspond with observations, since more-vigorous trees probably sequester more effective surface deterrents. In support of this, it was found that relative provenance susceptibility to aphids was correlated with feeding damage by a completely different insect, the large pine weevil Hylobius abietis. In a separate series of experiments, shoot material from P.sitchensis provenances was challenged with weevils of known age and cultural background, and the amount of bark removed in a feeding trial was recorded. The greatest levels of bark removal tended to be found on provenances which had hosted larger peak aphid populations. The most likely explanation for a fairly universal resistance mechanism probably derives from secondary plant metabolites rather than the nutrient levels available to both insects.																	0293-1915		2-7380-0883-6				1999		90					199	210										WOS:000082204900017

These results, on short-term use of space, were related to concurrent availability of prey. The use by caracal of specific plant communities showed a significant positive correlation to prey biomass of rodents. Males had much larger home-ranges (26.9 +/- 0.75 km(2)) than females (7.39 +/- 1.68 km(2)). Male home-ranges overlapped completely with those of females, whereas female ranges overlapped between 0 and 19%. Caracal were active by night and day; onset of activity was affected more by ambient temperature (T-A) than photoperiod. Caracal were active significantly longer on nights colder than 20 degrees C, Females ceased activity at T-A > 20 degrees C, males at T-A > 22 degrees C. Males foraged faster than females (667 vs. 312 m h(-1)) and moved more than twice the distance of females during an active period.

Among city, age and sex, city was the only factor determining significant group differences. In the present paper, the same version of the H&O's questionnaire was applied to a distinct population of 260 adults, balanced according to age, sex and city. Data were collected from October to December, to control the effect of the photoperiod. City remains the only factor determining significant group differences (p<0.001). Moreover, there does not appear a coherent latitude trend that could explain differences among cities as a function of photoperiod. Local social habits could probably explain our results, suggesting further investigations of peculiar temporal patterns.

Differences in the electroantennal responses of apple- and hawthorn-infesting races of Rhagoletis pomonella to host fruit volatile compounds	CHEMOECOLOGY												Domestic apple (Malus pumila)- and hawthorn (Crataegus sp.)-infesting races of Rhagoletis pomonella, Walsh (Diptera: Tephritidae) provide an excellent model to examine the role that host plant specificity plays during sympatric speciation (i.e., divergence in the absence of geographic isolation). Previous work has shown that these races differ in their propensities to accept apple and hawthorn fruits in behavioral choice assays, and that this discrimination translates into "host fidelity" in the field (i.e., apple flies tend to mate on and oviposit into apples and hawthorn flies on hawthorns). We present the results of a study examining possible physiological factors contributing to host choice differences in R. pomonella. We tested whether apple and hawthorn flies differ in their electroantennogram (EAG) responses to biologically relevant volatile compounds emitted from apples and hawthorns. Significant differences were found in the relative EAG responses of apple and hawthorn flies to host fruit compounds at five of six paired study sites across the eastern United States. The geographic pattern of EAG variation was complex, however, with local populations of apple and hawthorn flies tending to be more similar to one another than to flies of the same race at distant sites. This pattern was largely due to EAG responses for several compounds showing longitudinal or latitudinal clines, the latitudinal clines being similar to those observed for allozyme loci in the host races. We also found evidence for sex-related differences, as males tended to have higher mean EAG responses to compounds than females. Host-associated differences were therefore nested within geographic and sex-related differentiation in R. pomonella. Further behavioral studies are needed to distinguish whether the EAG differences are responsible for, as opposed to being a consequence of, host-plant fidelity and adaptation. Crosses are also required to establish a genetic basis for the EAG responses, although we did find significant correlations between EAG scores for several compounds and the allozymes NADH-Diaphorase-2 and Hydroxyacid dehydrogenase at one of the study sites. Questions therefore remain concerning the evolutionary significance of the EAG response differences between apple and hawthorn fly races. Nevertheless, these differences raise the possibility that antennal responses to fruit-related volatile compounds contribute to host plant discrimination in R. pomonella. Regardless, the EAG responses represent another set of traits, in addition to diapause: eclosion time phenotypes and allozyme frequencies, differing between apple and hawthorn host races of R. pomonella.																	0937-7409					DEC	1998	8	4					175	186		10.1007/s000490050023								WOS:000208087100004						
J	Armbruster, P; Bradshaw, WE; Holzapfel, CM				Armbruster, P; Bradshaw, WE; Holzapfel, CM			Effects of postglacial range expansion on allozyme and quantitative genetic variation of the pitcher-plant mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii	EVOLUTION												We determined allozyme variability of 34 populations of the pitcher-plant mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii, from Florida (30 degrees N) to northern Manitoba (54 degrees N) and compared allozyme variability with the additive genetic variance for preadult development time and photoperiodic response determined previously for six populations over a similar range (30-50 degrees N). Phylogenetic analysis of allozymes shows a well-defined split between Gulf Coast and lowland North Carolina populations, similar to previously observed phylogeographic patterns in a wide variety of taxa. A deeper split in the phylogeny of W. smithii coincides with the location of the maximum extent of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Furthermore, both average heterozygosity and patterns of isolation-by-distance decline in populations north of the former glacial border. It is likely that northern populations are the result of a range expansion that occurred subsequent to the late-Wisconsin retreat of the Laurentide Ice Sheet and that these populations have not yet reached a drift-migration equilibrium. The northern decline in allozyme heterozygosity contrasts sharply with the northern increase in additive genetic variance of development time and photoperiodic response found in previous studies. These previous studies also showed that the genetic divergence of populations has involved stochastic variation in the contribution of dominance and epistasis to the genetic architecture underlying demographic traits, including preadult development time, and photoperiodic response. When taken together, the present and prior studies identify the genetic processes underlying the lack of concordance between geographic patterns of allozyme and quantitative genetic variation in natural populations of W. smithii. In the presence of nonadditive genetic variation, isolation and drift can result in opposite patterns of genetic variation for structural genes and quantitative traits.																	0014-3820					DEC	1998	52	6					1697	1704		10.1111/j.1558-5646.1998.tb02249.x								WOS:000078076700015	28565309

We conducted model sensitivity analyses to determine how predicted migration schedules might vary with respect to the landscape and the physical environment. In landscapes with closely spaced, high-quality stopovers, female Pectoral Sandpipers can vary widely :in their migration schedules and still arrive on the breeding grounds early enough and with sufficient energy reserves to achieve maximum reproductive success. Such a population might appear quite variable, and show no stopover patterns, even if all individuals were making optimal decisions. Latitudinal gradients in temperature and photoperiod differentially affect a bird's energy budget as it moves northward in the spring. Stopovers at more northerly locations are associated with higher metabolic rates, lower food abundance in early spring, and longer days for feeding. The optimal migration schedule in these conditions can be quite different From that in a homogeneous environment, and patterns observed in the field can be misinterpreted if the environmental gradients are not considered. The landscape and the physical environment shape migration schedules and influence one's ability to interpret patterns observed at stopovers. Modeling these factors may lead to new insights about migration adaptations in heterogeneous environments.																	0908-8857					DEC	1998	29	4					405	415		10.2307/3677159								WOS:000078186100006						
J	Bradshaw, WE; Holzapfel, CM; Davison, TE				Bradshaw, WE; Holzapfel, CM; Davison, TE			Hourglass and rhythmic components of photoperiodic time measurement in the pitcher plant mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii	OECOLOGIA												The mosquito, Wycomyia smithii, enters a larval dormancy or diapause that is initiated, maintained, and terminated by photoperiod. The median or critical photoperiod regulating diapause increases from 12 h of light per day along the Gulf of Mexico, USA (30 degrees N), to over 15 h in southern Canada (49 degrees N). Photoperiodic time measurement in TT. smithii comprises both rhythmic and hourglass (interval timer) components. Using interrupted-night and resonance experiments, we show that both the rhythmic and hourglass components are prominent in the southern (ancestral) populations and that the influence of the rhythmic component declines with increasing latitude, while the hourglass component remains strong in northern (derived) populations. Previously, it has been shown that the genetic differences in critical photoperiod between northern populations and their southern ancestors involve not only the additive (independent) effects of genes, but also gene-gene interaction (epistasis). We therefore conclude that adaptive evolution of W. smithii has probably involved the progressive epistatic masking of the ancestral rhythmic component resulting in photoperiodic time measurement in northern populations accomplished principally through a day-interval timer. A comparison of W. smithii with previous studies indicates that the decline in critical photoperiod with increasing latitude represents an overall decrease in response to light rather than a shift in the timing of photosensitivity among arthropods in general. We propose that the underlying functional components of photoperiodic time measurement, as well as the overt photoperiodic response. are either homologous or are themselves responding directly to selection over latitudinal gradients in seasonality.																	0029-8549					DEC	1998	117	4					486	495		10.1007/s004420050684								WOS:000078086400005	28307673

Isotope studies have yielded conflicting results on cave bear diet, however, often without consideration of the provenance of the samples or the possible contradictions that taphonomic and morphologic evidence might pose to dietary interpretations. It is likely that cave bear habits varied somewhat in response to environmental circumstance, and the limits on their abilities to do so remain unknown. If the larger goal of paleontological inquiry is to reconstruct the adaptations of cave bear species, then variation and commonalities among populations must be tracked closely and the disparate lines of evidence currently available examined together on a case by case basis. Clearly, no single analytical technique can achieve this. By way of example we present the results of a cross-disciplinary collaboration that combines osteometric, isotopic, and taphonomic approaches to studying the paleoecology of a bear assemblage from Yarimburgaz Cave in northwest Turkey. Reference information on the linkages between diet, hibernation, and population structure in modern bears provides test implications for the investigation. Osteometric techniques demonstrate the presence of two coextant middle Pleistocene bear species in the sample - Ursus (Spelearctos) deningeri, a form of cave bear, and U. arctos or brown bear - the former abundant in the sample, the latter rare. An attritional mortality pattern for the bears and the condition of their bones show that most or all of the animals died in the cave from nonviolent causes in the context of hibernation. The study also elucidates several characteristics of the cave bear population in this region. Osteometric techniques show that the adult sex ratio of the cave bears is only slightly skewed toward females. This pattern lies near one extreme of the full range of possible outcomes in modern bear species and can only reflect a strong dietary dependence on seasonally available plants and invertebrates, showing that hibernation was a crucial overwintering strategy for both sexes; the results specifically contradict the possibility of regular, heavy emphasis on large game (hunted or scavenged) as a winter food source. The nature of wear and breakage to the adult cave bear teeth indicates that food frequently was obtained from cryptic sources, requiring digging and prying, and that extensive mastication was necessary leading to complete obliteration of some cheek tooth crowns in old individuals. The patterns of tooth damage during life corroborate the dietary implications of the adult sex ratio and also argue for a diet rich in tough, abrasive materials such as nuts, tubers, and associated grit. The carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions of cave and brown bear tooth enamel from the site are virtually identical, and there is no evidence of a strong marine signal in either species, despite the cave's proximity to a modern estuary of the Sea of Marmara; nitrogen isotope ratios could not be examined because of poor protein preservation. The isotope results suggest that both bear species were highly omnivorous in the region during the middle Pleistocene acid obtained nearly all of their food from terrestrial and fresh-water habitats. Bone pathologies, usually originating from trauma, occur in some of the adult bears, testifying to long lifespans of some individuals in this fossil population. The Yarimburgaz cave bears also exhibit great size dimorphism between the sexes, based on weight-bearing carpal bone dimensions, with adult males attaining roughly twice the body mass of adult females.																	0094-8373					WIN	1998	24	1					74	98										WOS:000072055800006						
J	McWatters, HG; Saunders, DS				McWatters, HG; Saunders, DS			Maternal temperature has different effects on the photoperiodic response and duration of larval diapause in blow fly (Calliphora vicina) strains collected at two latitudes	PHYSIOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												The blow fly Calliphora vicina Robineau-Desvoidy (Diptera: Calliphoridae) has a wide distribution across northern and temperate Europe. It has a facultative, maternally-induced larval diapause in response go short days. The photoperiodic response, measured at 15 and 20 degrees C, of two populations was compared. A southern population (originating at 51 degrees N) was sensitive to temperature at all daylengths; the incidence of diapause was greatly reduced at 20 degrees C compared with 15 degrees C. The photoperiodic response of a northern population (from 65 degrees N) was sensitive to temperature only in long days; in short days (< 14 h of light) the response of this strain was identical at each temperature. Variation in parental photoperiod and temperature were found to affect the duration of larval diapause, indicating a role for maternal effects in diapause intensity as well as incidence. However, the between-strain variation was greater than that within strains, indicating qualitative differences in diapause response. These differences may arise from the ecological conditions at the points of origin of the two strains. The northern strain from the harsher climate has a more intense diapause that follows a relatively temperature-insensitive photoperiodic response. In contrast, the southern strain has a shallow diapause and its photoperiodic response may be overridden by the experience of concurrent high temperature.																	0307-6962					DEC	1998	23	4					369	375		10.1046/j.1365-3032.1998.234101.x								WOS:000077360300010						
J	Miles, JE; Bale, JS; Hodkinson, ID				Miles, JE; Bale, JS; Hodkinson, ID			Life cycle regulation in the heather psyllid Strophingia ericae: responses to temperature and photoperiod	PHYSIOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												The response of overwintering nymphs of Strophingia ericae (Curtis) (Homoptera: Psylloidea) to long and short photoperiods over a range of temperatures was investigated to determine the interaction between these factors and winter development as a regulatory mechanism of their hfe cycle. Strophingia ericae was successfully reared from egg to adult in a long photoperiod (LD 18:6h) at 10, 15 and 20 degrees C on its host plans Calluna vulgaris. Although development time was longer at 10 than at 15 or 20 degrees C(approximate to 263 days compared with approximate to 155 and approximate to 159 days, respectively), there was no interruption in development at any of these temperatures, indicating that there was no obligatory diapause. However, short photoperiod (LD 12:12 h) inhibited development of overwintering fifth instars collected from the field in early winter. Those collected in September and kept at 15 degrees C developed to adult in approximate to 120 days in a short photoperiod (LD 12:12 h) compared with approximate to 40 days in a long photoperiod (LD 18:6 h). Inhibition became weaker in December and disappeared by January, when fifth instars developed to adult at the same rate in both long and short photoperiods ( approximate to 30 days). A similar photoperiodic response was observed when the experiment was repeated at 10 degrees C, although development times were consistently longer. The observation that insects collected from the field in early winter were able to resume development immediately: on transfer to favourable conditions (15 degrees C and LD 18:6 h photocycle) suggests that there is a photoperiodically induced quiescence (rather than a true diapause) in overwintering S. ericae, which becomes progressively reduced as winter proceeds. It was concluded that the life cycle of the upland and possibly the lowland form. of S. ericae is regulated by a winter-active photoperiodic inhibition of development, which effectively synchronizes the emergence of the adult stage with higher spring temperatures and renewed host plant growth.																	0307-6962					DEC	1998	23	4					376	381		10.1046/j.1365-3032.1998.00098.x								WOS:000077360300011						
J	Koziol, M				Koziol, M			Influence of altitude on adult emergence and dynamics of Kaltenbachiola strobi (WINNERTZ) (Diptera : Cecidomyiidae) populations and its parasites in the Tatra National Park, Poland	ANZEIGER FUR SCHADLINGSKUNDE PFLANZENSCHUTZ UMWELTSCHUTZ												A field study on Kaltenbachiola strobi (WINNERIZ) (Dipteia: Cecidomyiidae), was carried out between 1987 and 1993 in the highest mountain range in the Western Carpathians located within the Tatra National Park, in southern Poland. Rearing and analysis of 5 780 cones of Picea abies (L.) KARST., collected from trees growing at different altitudes, yielded 30,478 individuals of Kaltenbachiola strobi, which infested 89.10% of the cones. In case of 29.81% of cones there were more than 20 larvae of K. strobi per cone. It was shown that K. scrobi in the Tatra Mts. is more abundant in spruce stands of the upper mountain forest zone. Significant connections between the time of cone infestation by K. strobi and its parasitoids and characteristic phenophases in spruce foliage and cone development, and alsb the development of selected vegetation of the forest floor at different heights above sea level were determined. It was shown that the population dynamics of K, strobi had tendency to alternate the increase and decrease in numbers every two years. It was also discovered that every two years spruce cones were inhabited by the population of K: strobi with increased percentage of individuals having prolonged diapause. In total, the parasitoids reduced the population of K. strobi by about 16-22.63%. Parasitism of K. strobi in the lower mountain forest zone was higher than in the upper zone. Triplatygaster contorticornis RATZ. (Hymenoptera: Platygasteridae), Torymus azureus BOHEMAN (Hymenoptera: Torymidae) and Tetrastichus strobilanae RATZ (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) were most efficient in reduction of the population of K. strobi, and in the lower mountain forest zone T. azureus was the dominant parasitoid species, while in the upper zone T. contorticornis and T. strobilanae. It was shown that a considerable part of the populations of T. azureus, T. contorticornis and T. strobilanae have their diapause prolonged and highly synchronized with the diapause of their host.																	0340-7330					NOV	1998	71	7					121	127		10.1007/BF02770671								WOS:000077014400001						
J	Bohonak, AJ				Bohonak, AJ			Genetic population structure of the fairy shrimp Branchinecta coloradensis (Anostraca) in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE												Dispersal rates for freshwater invertebrates are often inferred from population genetic data. Although genetic approaches can indicate the amount of isolation in natural populations, departures from an equilibrium between drift and gene flow often lead to biased gene flow estimates. I investigated the genetic population structure of the pond-dwelling fairy shrimp Branchinecta coloradensis in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, U.S.A., using allozymes. Glaciation in this area and the availability of direct dispersal estimates from previous work permit inferences regarding the relative impacts of history and contemporary gene flow on population structure. Hierarchical F statistics were used, to quantify differentiation within and between valleys (theta(SV) and theta(VT) respectively). Between valleys separated by 5-10 km, a high degree of differentiation (theta(VT) = 0.77) corresponds to biologically reasonable gene flow estimates of 0.07 individuals per generation, although it is possible that this value represents founder effects and nonequilibrium conditions. On a local scale (less than or equal to 110 m), populations are genetically similar (theta(SV) = 0.13) and gene flow is estimated to be 1.7 individuals exchanged between ponds each generation. This is very close to an ecological estimate of dispersal for B. coloradensis via salamanders. Gene flow estimates from previous studies on other Anostraca are also similar on comparable geographic scales. Thus, population structure in B. coloradensis appears to be at or near equilibrium on a local scale, and possibly on a regional scale as well.																	0008-4301					NOV	1998	76	11					2049	2057		10.1139/cjz-76-11-2049								WOS:000080396100010

J	Musil, CF; Newton, RJ; Farrant, JM				Musil, CF; Newton, RJ; Farrant, JM			Ultraviolet irradiation effects on serotinous Leucadendron laureolum seeds: altered seed physiology and ultrastructure, and seedling performance	PLANT ECOLOGY												Dry seeds of Leucadendron laureolum (Lam.) Fourc. (Proteaceae) were exposed for different intervals (range: 7 to 84 days) to visible, UV-A and UV-B radiation of different biologically effective dose (range: 0 to 11.43 kJ m(-2) d(-1)). Changes in seed germination, physiology and ultrastructure, and residual UV effects on seedling performance, were examined. Germination was depressed in seeds following short (7-day) exposures to UV radiation. This depression was intensified with increased UV exposure dose, and most pronounced at shorter UV-B wavelengths. Also glutathione reductase (GR) activities increased in seeds exposed to shorter UV-B wavelengths, but these were unaffected by irradiation dose level in the UV-B range. Electrolyte leakage rates from UV-irradiated seeds were unaltered, which indicated that germination depression did not result from intrinsic membrane damage. The reversal of germination depression (W-induced dormancy) in UV-irradiated seeds by red light pointed to the possible involvement of phytochrome in this photo-response. Germination depression disappeared in seeds after 56-days irradiation, possibly due to photoreceptor damage by excess UV light. At this stage, all UV irradiated seeds, irrespective of treatment wavelength or dose level, exhibited increased electrolyte leakage rates, which indicated membrane perturbation. Also, increased GR activities were observed in irradiated seeds, but these were proportionately smaller in seeds exposed to shorter wavelength UV-B radiation (9.1 to 35.8% increase) than longer wavelength UV-A (73.4% increase) and visible (97.7% increase) radiation. This implied a metabolic limitation for scavenging of free radicals and peroxides in aging seeds exposed to UV-B radiation, which pointed to accelerated seed deterioration. It was indirectly supported by ultrastructural evidence of sub-cellular damage (Lipid coagulation and plasmalemma withdrawal from cell walls) in embryonic tissues of seeds after 84 days UV-B exposure, and reflected in decreased leaf numbers, photochemical efficiencies, and foliar chlorophyll a and carotenoid levels in seedlings cultured from these seeds.

Temperature- and time-dependent mortalities were studied and modelled in insects exposed in regimes with constant and alternating temperatures. In these experiments, freezing was not a cause of death. 2. Survival rates at a range of constant low temperatures (-5 to + 1 degrees C) and for different exposure periods (1-14 days) were measured in the summer acclimated springtail Orchesella cincta. 3. Daily interruptions of the cold exposure with short intervals at high temperature reduced mortality or slowed the increase of mortality. This effect was stronger at higher temperature (19 vs 5 and 12 degrees C) and increased with the duration of the interruption (0.25-2 h). 4. The injury was reversible when the cold exposure was limited to 2 days. 5. Survival in desiccated animals (14% water loss) was reduced. 6. It is suggested that the mortality of summer acclimated springtails is caused by a complex metabolic disorder and membrane changes at low temperatures.

J	Marrs, RH; Johnson, SW; Le Duc, MG				Marrs, RH; Johnson, SW; Le Duc, MG			Control of bracken and restoration of heathland. VII. The response of bracken rhizomes to 18 years of continued bracken control or 6 years of control followed by recovery	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. The effects of six bracken control treatments applied ill combination wi th a Calluna* seeding treatment on the rhizome system of bracken Pteridium aquilinum at Cavenham Heath in Breckland was assessed after 18 years. Bracken control included cutting once and twice yearly between 1978 and 1996, spraying the herbicide asulam at the recommended rate (4.4 kg a.i. ha(-1)) in two treatments (1978 and 1978 plus 1979), each followed by repeat doses in 1984 and 1990, and spraying asulam followed by cutting once yearly. After 6 years the experiment was split and bracken control was continued/reapplied on half the plots and stopped on the remainder. The effects of treatment on the numbers of active and dormant buds and the length and biomass on both frond-bearing and storage rhizomes were measured. 2. When applied continuously over the 18 years, all treatments reduced all rhizome measures, but treatments that included cutting were more effective than ones that just used asulam. The best treatment after 10-12 years was cutting twice yearly, but after 18 years this treatment had apparently reached an equilibrium and the cutting-once-yearly treatment was superior. No treatment eradicated the bracken in 18 years of continuous treatment. 3. When bracken control treatments were stopped after 6 years rhizome recovery started within 4 years and there was significant recovery thereafter. After 12 years the least effective treatment, cut once yearly, although still showing a significant reduction in rhizome biomass, had recovered to 88% of the untreated plots. The most effective treatment was cutting twice yearly for 6 years, where most measures of rhizome performance remained at approximately 50% of untreated plots 12 years after cutting stopped. 4. Regression analysis was used to investigate the relationship between frond production and rhizome characteristics. Rhizome biomass, especially of the storage rhizome component, was consistently the most important variable; frond bud numbers were less important. 5. Simple models, developed making assumptions that the response of the rhizome to treatment is linear through time, have been shown to be invalid over the longer time period. This is because the impacts of the treatments reduce through time. 6, These results are discussed in relation to long-term bracken control and the assessment of bracken stocks. If bracken is to be suppressed on a long-term basis a continuous control strategy is needed. It is unlikely that complete eradication will be possible with current control technology. The long time scale found for the total recovery of the bracken from only 6 years of treatment (> 12 years) means that the large areas of bracken that have been treated in the past will take some time to recover to pretreatment levels. This recovery is an unknown factor in bracken stock assessments.

J	Reierth, E; Stokkan, KA				Reierth, E; Stokkan, KA			Dual entrainment by light and food in the Svalbard ptarmigan (Lagopus mutus hyperboreus)	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL RHYTHMS												The possibility that feeding may act as a zeitgeber has been investigated in captive Svalbard ptarmigan by recording feeding or food-searching activity (FA) in birds given periodic access to food (PAF) under light-dark (LD) cycles or in continuous bright (LL) or dim light (DD) conditions. Except during LL, anticipatory attempts to feed always occurred prior to the food access interval with a relatively stable phase relationship to the interval. There was always a second bout of feeding toward the end of the food access interval, which apparently corresponds to the afternoon bout of feeding, seen under LD and ad libitum access to food. During PAF this afternoon peak of activity disappeared. When the LD cycle was phase delayed while restricted access to food remained unchanged, the afternoon peak of feeding was temporarily reestablished but was transiently shifted forward to reattain its position within the food access interval. After termination of PAF, the afternoon bout of feeding was reestablished through phase-delaying transients, with an initial phase corresponding to the previous food access interval. The results suggest that FA of Svalbard ptarmigan is controlled by 2 separate circadian oscillators, both of which can be entrained by Light and food: a putative morning oscillator, which controls the activity associated with the beginning of the photoperiod or the food access interval, and a putative evening oscillator, which induces increased activity toward the end of these intervals. In their natural environment at very high latitudes, Svalbard ptarmigan deposit fat when the day length declines rapidly in autumn. Entrained by feeding, they appear to enjoy a longer daily period of food-searching activity than if day length was the only zeitgeber.																	0748-7304					OCT	1998	13	5					393	402		10.1177/074873098129000219								WOS:000084036700004	9783230

This is the first evidence of a sexual pheromone in a Mymaridae. Under a 16L: 8D photoperiod and 24 degrees C constant temperature, the responsiveness of males to females of different ages varied significantly during the photophase. When <1-day-old females were used, males made significantly more final choices in the pheromone field than odorless fields at 4 and 6 hr after the onset of the photophase, and their walking speed was significantly higher from 4 to 12 hr, suggesting that females began to release a long-range pheromone during this period. Final choices and high walking speed were observed earlier with 1- and 2-day-old females than with <1-day-old females, and there was a significant decrease in male responses at 6 hr after the onset of the photophase, suggesting a bimodal temporal pattern of sexual pheromone emission.

The absolute temperature range compatible,vith life between the two limits SCP and TSP, termed thermobiological span (TBS), was calculated in both conditions. The potential adaptive capacity to withstand cooling and overheating is: (i) at 100% r.h., mean TSP = 46.7 degrees C (SD +/- 0.67); mean SCP = -9.4 degrees C (SD +/- 1.81); absolute TBS 56.1 degrees C; (ii) at 0% r.h., mean TSP = 47.4 degrees C (SD +/- 0.61); mean SCP = -12.3 degrees C (SD +/- 2.5); mean TBS 59.7 degrees C (SD +/- 2.43), The TSP at 0% r.h. is reached with a loss of 3.84% in fresh weight vs 1.15% at 100% r.h.. The difference in the SCP (females = 2.1 degrees C; males = 5.4 degrees C) obtained in dry or moist conditions could also be explained by the influence of the heat shock preceding the SCP measured at 0% r.h. A decrease of water content may increase the osmolarity of the body fluid and thus the supercooling capacity and could be an adaptation to avoid freezing. Supercooling capacity allows adults to survive in areas where freezing temperatures may occur in poultry houses and more specially during the winter litter removals when adult beetles migrate and overwinter in the soil floor or in insulation materials of the building walls, The heat tolerance capacity is mainly ruled by the physiological and behavioural adaptations of this species. Our results suggest that the adult population of A. diaperinus could be controlled by increasing the temperature above 48 degrees C.

J	Kerstetter, RE; Zepp, RG; Carreira, LH				Kerstetter, RE; Zepp, RG; Carreira, LH			Peroxidases in grass dew derived from guttation: possible role in polymerization of soil organic matter	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Peroxidases are enzymes that catalyze the oxidative cross-linking and polymerization of certain organic compounds by hydrogen peroxide and other organic peroxides. This study demonstrates that peroxidases are present in dew (droplets formed as the result of guttation) collected from Bermuda grass hybrids 419 and Tifway 2 [Cynodon dactylon (L.) x Cynodon transvaalensis Davy], which are warm-season C(4) grasses, and Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.), which is a cool-season C(3) grass. Peroxidase activity [quantified with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (activity 152 purpurogallin units/mg) as standard] in guttational fluids collected from grasses during early morning was in the 80 to 120 mu g/L range. Isoelectric focusing was used to determine isoelectric points (pI) of the isozymes present in the Bermuda grass dew following dialysis and lyophilization of the collected dew. The pi values ranged from 4.3 to 8.3 with 14 isozymes being detected using guaiacol and hydrogen peroxide as substrates. Peroxidases also were extracted from soil supporting the growth of Bermuda grass. Peroxidases in these soils were most abundant in the top 5 cm layer (activity was in the 6.8 to 16 purpurogallin units/g range). Stability and activity of these peroxidases in the presence of fulvic and humic acids were evaluated. Compared to controls with no added humic substances, peroxidase activity was inhibited by a soil fulvic acid and prolonged by a humic acid. Field measurements indicated that peroxidase activity did not meetly decrease during the winter when the grass was dormant, indicating that the peroxidases released into the soil remain active for a considerable time. Based on results in these studies and previously determined dry and wet deposition of atmospheric peroxides, we estimate that peroxidase-catalyzed reactions in areas planted in these grasses may convert about 8 g C m(-2) yr(-1) of labile soil organic compounds to more persistent oligomers and polymers.																	0168-2563					SEP	1998	42	3					311	323		10.1023/A:1005982226333								WOS:000075584900003						
J	Noronha, C; Cloutier, C				Noronha, C; Cloutier, C			Effect of soil conditions and body size on digging by prediapause Colorado potato beetles (Coleoptera : Chrysomelidae)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE												The effect of soil temperature, density, and moisture on digging of prediapause Colorado potato beetles (Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say)) was studied in 1.9 cm diameter soil columns. Beetles dug for between several days and a few weeks before finally resting. Speed of digging peaked during the initial hours and decreased slowly thereafter. A soil temperature near 16 degrees C was the optimum in terms of incidence of digging (95%) and final diapausing depth. The intensity of these two responses was reduced at higher (less than or equal to 24 degrees C) and lower (greater than or equal to 8 degrees C) temperatures. When given a choice of four soil densities, 50% of the beetles preferred the lightest soil (0.64 g/cm(3)), but 11% chose the heaviest soil (1.14 g/cm(3)). When a range of nine soil densities was provided in a no-choice situation, digging speed and depth decreased exponentially with increasing soil density, suggesting that energy invested in digging is limited. Peak digging speed during the first 2 h averaged 4.33 cm/h in light soil and only 0.83 mm/h in heavily compacted soil. Dry soil (40-45% water by mass) inhibited digging, while nearly saturated soil (65%) was fully acceptable. Digging speed and depth were maximal in the 50-55% moisture range. Beetle size had a positive effect on digging. For each additional 1 mg of fresh mass, beetles dug for 1 day longer, reached 1 cm deeper in soil columns, and dug 0.5 mm/h faster during the initial burst of digging.																	0008-4301					SEP	1998	76	9					1705	1713		10.1139/cjz-76-9-1705								WOS:000079525300012						
J	Watanabe, NC				Watanabe, NC			Geographical variation in Japan in egg development of the mayfly, Ephoron shigae (Ephemeroptera : Polymitarcyidae)	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The effect of temperature on embryonic development was compared in four populations, two bisexual and two unisexual, of Ephoron shigae, including one each near the northern and southern periphery of the species range in Japan. 2. Eggs from every population were chilled at 4, 8 or 12 degrees C for diapause development after 50 days at 20 degrees C for pre-diapause development (experiment I). Some eggs hatched during chilling at 8 degrees C or 12 degrees C, whereas no eggs hatched at 4 degrees C. The rate of hatching in a given condition of chilling was higher for the eggs from warmer winter environments. 3. Chilling at 4 or 8 degrees C effectively facilitated diapause development. Chilling at 12 degrees C was, in general, not so effective, but relatively effective for the eggs from warmer winter environments. 4. Eggs were incubated at 8, 12, 15 or 20 degrees C after chilling at 4 degrees C to examine the effect of temperature on post-diapause development (experiment II). The eggs incubated at higher temperature after chilling hatched quicker and more synchronously and had higher hatching success. 5. The relationship between temperature and the days required for hatching after chilling was well described by the power function. There was no significant difference in the slope of the regression lines (i.e. temperature dependency) among local populations. However, a longer time was required for hatching at a given temperature for the population from the colder winter environment. 6.

Merrill) seeds is a polygenic and complex trait that is responsive to environmental effects that occur during plant development. Our objective was to study the seed oil content of soybeans developed under diverse photoperiod and temperature conditions. Three parental inbred lines with classic (BR-13, FT-2 and BR85-29009) and one with long juvenile flowering type (OCEPAR 8) and the F2, F3, and F9 generations derived from all possible crosses between them (including reciprocals) were sowed in September 27th, October 20th and December 17th in 1993 in Londrina, Parana State, Brazil (between 23 degrees 08'47" and 23 degrees 55'46" latitude S). The October and December sowing dates are within the period the varietal research personnel recommend for sowing soybeans in Parana State. The analysis of variance indicated significant differences among sowing dates, among advanced inbred lines, and the sowing date x inbred line interaction. Seed oil content increased from September to October and decreased from October to December in all materials, but the reduction was greater in FT-2 and OCEPAR 8 among the parentals. The additive genetic Variance (D) or additive variance among linked genes (DI) was significant for all crosses and sowing dates. Genotype x microenvironment interactions were important in some crosses. The additive [d] effects were greater in September and October, and the additive x additive interaction [i] was important in October among the mean genetic parameters. Significant dominance effects [h] were more frequent in December and October, often in direction of the increased seed oil content. The heritability estimates ranged from 15 to 43%, with the highest values obtained in September. The prediction of cross potential to generate higher seed oil inbred lines indicated that selection is likely to be successful in most crosses. The highest proportion of inbred lines with seed oil percentage above the standard (lines with more than 22% seed oil content) was for BR85-29009 x OCEPAR 8 in September, FT-2 x OCEPAR 8 in October, and in BR85-29009 x OCEPAR 8 and BR-13 x OCEPAR 8 in December.																	1415-4757					SEP	1998	21	3					387	394		10.1590/S1415-47571998000300017								WOS:000076749200017						
J	Scriber, JM; Deering, MD; Stump, AD				Scriber, JM; Deering, MD; Stump, AD			Evidence of long range transport of a dark morph swallowtail butterfly (Papilio glaucus) on a storm front into northern Michigan (Lepidoptera : Papilionidae)	GREAT LAKES ENTOMOLOGIST												A dark morph female Papilio glaucus was captured in the middle of a P. canadensis population in the center of Dickinson County, in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. We are unaware of any dark female ever being captured at this latitude, and none within 400 km has ever before been reported. Morphological wing traits all score this dark female as P.! glaucus, with all 31 of the other (yellow) females captured from the same group of nectar sources scoring as Il canadensis. Two diagnostic electrophoretic allozymes (PGD and LDH) show all 24 males to have 100% P. canadensis alleles, and 98% canadensis alleles were seen for the HK locus. The dark female had the P. glaucus X-linked allele for PGD, the P. canadensis X-linked allele for LDH, and was heterozygous for diagnostic HK alleles which are autosomal. All other yellow females that were examined were pure canadensis type for the sex-linked PGD and LDH alleles. One yellow female was heterozygous for the autosomal HK diagnostic alleles. Along distance "blow-in" on a strong weather front from the southwest is suspected as the most likely explanation for the appearance of this dark morph female of mixed (introgressed) genetic background so far from its nearest known source. The blow-in was not likely to have been in a previous year since this dark morph female would require both (1) a dark morph mother with the Y-linked dark gene and (2) a father that was part I! glaucus (i.e, without the color suppressor genes and with a PGD-100 allele). None of the males from this area had PGD or LDH alleles of the canadensis type this year or ever previously, making it unlikely that the blow-in occurred in a previous year.																	0090-0222					FAL-WIN	1998	31	3-4					151	160										WOS:000079275300002

The critical photoperiod giving 50% diapause was between 14 and 16 h at 20 degrees C, between 12 and 14 h at 25 degrees C and between 6 and 8 h at 30 degrees C. Effects of night interruption by a 2-h light pulse on the diapause response were examined at 25 degrees C on different background photoperiods ranging from LD 12:12 h to LD 2:22 h. Percentage diapause was very low when the middle portion of dark period was interrupted, so that U- or V-shaped response curves were obtained with background scotophases longer than 12 h. In these curves, the descending slopes were less steep than the ascending slopes. The critical dark period measured from dusk to an interrupting light pulse was about 1.5 h longer than the critical dark period (c. 10 h) in the normal photoperiodic response. The critical dark period from the interrupting light pulse to dawn, on the other hand, was not parallel to dawn but shorter than the normal critical period in LD 12:12 h and LD 10:14 h and longer than that in LD 7:17 h to LD 4:20 h, indicating that the priming effects of the light pulse might be under the influence of the photophase.																	0307-6962					SEP	1998	23	3					249	254		10.1046/j.1365-3032.1998.233088.x								WOS:000075780500008						
J	Panizzi, AR; Oliveira, EDM				Panizzi, AR; Oliveira, EDM			Performance and seasonal abundance of the neotropical brown stink bug, Euschistus heros nymphs and adults on a novel food plant (pigeonpea) and soybean	ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA												Pigeonpea, Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp. (Leguminosae) was found as a novel food plant of the neotropical brown stink bug, Euschistus heros (F.), in Parana State, Brazil. Laboratory studies indicated nymphs performing better when fed on immature pods of soybean, Glycine max (L.) Merrill (Leguminosae), than on immature pods of pigeonpea. Female nymphs required 1.7 d less to complete development and tended to have a lower mortality on soybean (17.5%) than on pigeonpea (25.0%). At emergence, fresh body weight was greater on soybean than on pigeonpea. Adult E. her-os performed better on soybean than on pigeonpea. After 120 d, approximate to 35% of adults were alive on soybean and 30% on pigeonpea; 93.3% of females oviposited on soybean, and 73.3% on pigeonpea, with an oviposition delay of approximate to 17 days on pigeonpea compared to soybean. Fecundity was approximate to 63% greater on soybean than on pigeonpea, and adult body weight gain for females and males at different ages was approximate to 6-36% greater on soybean than on pigeonpea. E. her-os colonized soybean during January-March, from the pod-setting and filling stages (R3-R6) to maturity (R7-R8), and pigeonpea during April-June. These results indicate that E. her-os has expanded its host range to pigeonpea in Brazil; pods of this plant are suitable food, and can support the insect during autumn-early winter, after soybean harvest, and before it enters into partial hibernation.																	0013-8703					AUG	1998	88	2					169	175		10.1046/j.1570-7458.1998.00359.x								WOS:000076268000009

Nymphs and adults were modeled using a conventional cohort approach. M. sanguinipes diapause was hypothesized to be a 2-phase process composed of diapause and embryogenesis, Egg hatch occurs only after both phases are completed. To model both phases concurrently, an individual-based modeling paradigm for M sanguinipes diapause was adopted. The model simulations produced results that are consistent with observations on the relative timing of egg hatch and occurrence of the nymphal and adult stages. Simulations over a 40 yr period, using only maximum-minimum temperatures as input, at each 4 geographically separated sites in eastern Colorado, did not compare favorably with USDA APHIS Annual Sur ev data in eastern Colorado. Addition of precipitation-mediated mortality greatly improved model predictions and results were more consistent with known broad-scale population trends. The results of die simulations suggest that, in Colorado, temperature conditions for grasshopper development and reproduction are generally favorable. In most years. there is sufficient beat for development and even in cooler, less favorable years, lowered temperatures do not appear to Le greatly limiting. Grasshopper populations in eastern Colorado may be more limited by the lack of suitable forage which is regulated by the amount and seasonal occurrence of precipitation. Future research efforts may yield important insights into grasshopper population fluctuations by focusing on identifying and understanding the most significant mortality factors that act on M. sanguinipes populations.

J	Mousseau, TA; Howard, DJ				Mousseau, TA; Howard, DJ			Genetic variation in cricket calling song across a hybrid zone between two sibling species	EVOLUTION												The sibling ground crickets Allonemobius fasciatus and A. socius meet along a mosaic hybrid zone at approximate to 40 degrees N latitude in eastern North America. In this paper we report the findings of a genetic analysis of calling-song variation within and among six cricket populations sampled along a transect through the hybrid zone in southern New Jersey. We compared aspects of the calling song of both wild-caught and laboratory-reared crickets to test the hypothesis that population differences in song observed in the wild were genetically based. We found significant, species-level differences in all aspects of the calling song, and these differences persisted even after a generation of common-garden rearing in the laboratory, supporting the hypothesis that interspecific variation observed in the wild largely reflects genetic differentiation between the two taxa. A discriminant function analysis indicated that individual crickets could be assigned to the proper taxon with less than 10% error, supporting the premise that calling song could be used by female crickets as a mechanism for species recognition. One population, collected from within the hybrid zone and containing significant numbers of hybrid individuals, was intermediate in its calling song, presumably reflecting this population's mixed genetic makeup. In this hybrid zone population, song phenotype was highly correlated to a hybrid index score generated using species-specific alleles at four diagnostic allozyme markers, suggesting a multigenic basis to calling-song variation in these crickets as well as linkage disequilibrium between markers and song. Based on an analysis of laboratory-reared full-sib families, broad-sense heritabilities for calling-song characteristics were generally significant in the two A. socius populations, whereas many components of song showed no significant family effects in the three A. fasciatus populations. The genotypically mixed, hybrid zone population showed very high heritabilities for most calling-song components, which likely reflect the influence of interspecific gene flow on genetic variation for quantitative traits.

J	Yasuhara, A; Momoi, S; Kondo, H				Yasuhara, A; Momoi, S; Kondo, H			Photoperiodic control of diapause in five species of Coccygomimus (Hymenoptera : Ichneumonidae) from Hokkaido, Japan	JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY												The effects of photoperiod and temperature on development and diapause in five species of Coccygomimus: C. pluto Ashmead, C. instigator Fabricius, C. alboannulatus Uchida, C. aquilonius japonicus Momoi, and C. disparis Viereck from Hokkaido, Japan were investigated. Based on :he patterns of photoperiodic control of diapause, these species were classified into two groups. In C. pluto and C. instigator, 90%-100% of individuals entered deep diapause in the final larval instar at 12L-12D and 13L-11D at 20 degrees C; the incidence of diapause was lower at shorter or longer photoperiods. In C. aquilonius japonicus and C. alboannulatus, the incidence of diapause was high at 13L-11D at 17 and 20 degrees C. These four species can be grouped together. In C. disparis, diapause occurred at short photoperiods at 15, but not at 17 and 20 degrees C and development was slightly retarded during the prepupal stage at short photoperiods. This species can be classified separately from the other four species. These five Coccygomimus species were sensitive to photoperiod only immediately before the diapause stage. Diapause ended at transfer from a short to a long photoperiod. A shift in temperature from 20 to 25 degrees C did not terminate diapause except in C. disparis where a shift from 15 to 20 or 25 degrees C stimulated resumption of rapid development. Based on these and other results, it is likely that photoperiodic control of diapause in Coccygomimus species is constrained by phyletic relationships, rather than by geographic distribution.																	0021-4914					AUG	1998	42	3					123	128										WOS:000076012500003						
J	Burrows, DW; Balciunas, JK				Burrows, DW; Balciunas, JK			Biology and host range of Pomponatius typicus Distant (Heteroptera : Coreidae), a potential biological control agent for the paperbark tree, Melaleuca quinquenervia, in southern Florida	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY												The native Australian broad-leaved paperbark tree, Melaleuca quinquenervia, is a major weed in southern Florida. Among the potential biological control agents studied for this weed is a coreid bug, Pomponatius typicus, whose adults and nymphs feed on the sap of young, fresh growing tips, causing wilting. Female P. typicus may lay 31 or more eggs. The nymphs emerge after 11-13 days and pass through five instars in approximately 2 months. Adults live for 4 months or more, and have been observed to enter an apparent diapause for up to 2 months. Parasites have been reared only from its eggs. Results of laboratory and field host-range studies indicate that this bug is restricted to Melaleuca spp., especially the Melaleuca leucadendra complex to which M. quinquenervia belongs, and Callistemon spp. (especially Callistemon viminalis). As C. viminalis is of only minor importance as an introduced ornamental in Florida and is also considered a weed, P. typicus was approved in 1996 for further studies in quarantine in the USA.																	1326-6756					JUL 3	1998	37		2				168	173		10.1111/j.1440-6055.1998.tb01566.x								WOS:000074980500014

In a population issued from a strain from middle latitudes, some females underwent only one parturial moult (northern tendency) and others three parturial moults (southern tendency). Females with an atypical northern phenology are the most numerous and tend to be found near the Danish population. In the latter, there is an asymmetrical response to laboratory selection (favourable to females with a longer breeding period). The asymmetrical variation in atypical individuals acts as a safety device against the unpredictability of the environment. The adaptation of this species, originally from the Mediterranean periphery, to a northern environment has led to a reduction in its capacity to breed over long periods of time. Populations from middle latitudes can undergo one or several parturial moults which enables the species to successfully colonize even far-away countries. These intrapopulation differences have an essential role and explain why Armadillidium vulgare is one of the most widely distributed species among Oniscidea.

J	Corlett, RT; LaFrankie, JV				Corlett, RT; LaFrankie, JV			Potential impacts of climate change on tropical Asian forests through an influence on phenology	CLIMATIC CHANGE					International Workshop on Potential Impacts of Climate Change on Tropical Forest Ecosystems	APR 24-28, 1995	SAN JUAN, PR	World Wildlife Fund, Int Inst Trop Forestry				Changes in plant phenology will be one of the earliest responses to rapid global climate change and could potentially have serious consequences both for plants and for animals that depend on periodically available plant resources. Phenological patterns are most diverse and least understood in the tropics. In those parts of tropical Asia where low temperature or drought impose a seasonal rest period, regular annual cycles of growth and reproduction predominate at the individual, population, and community level. In aseasonal areas, individuals and populations show a range of sub- to supra-annual periodicities, with an overall supra-annual reproductive periodicity at the community level. There is no evidence for photoperiod control of phenology in the Asian tropics, and seasonal changes in temperature are a likely factor only near the northern margins. An opportunistic response to water availability is the simplest explanation for most observed patterns where water is seasonally limiting, while the great diversity of phenological patterns in the aseasonal tropics suggests an equal diversity of controls. The robustness of current phenological patterns to high interannual and spatial variability suggests that most plant species will not be seriously affected by the phenological consequences alone of climate change. However, some individual plant species may suffer, and the consequences of changes in plant phenology for flower- and fruit-dependent animals in fragmented forests could be serious.

J	Caceres, CE				Caceres, CE			Interspecific variation in the abundance, production, and emergence of Daphnia diapausing eggs	ECOLOGY												Despite the ubiquity of dormancy among invertebrates, the demographic ties between the active and dormant stages remain largely unexplored in most systems. Nevertheless, dormant stages could potentially have significant impacts on the ecology and evolution of the active population. In Oneida Lake, New York, populations of the suspension-feeding crustaceans Daphnia galeata mendotae and Daphnia pulicaria produce large numbers of long-lived diapausing eggs, which accumulate in the sediments to densities of over 2.5 x 10(4) eggs/m(2) for D. galeata mendotae and 8.0 x 10(4) eggs/m(2) for D. pulicaria. Sedimentation rates obtained by Pb-210 dating suggest that these eggs can remain viable for > 125 yr and that these two Daphnia populations have persisted in this system for > 200 yr. Total annual production of new diapausing eggs can range from 0 to over 10(4) new eggs/ m(2) of sediment. Annual emergence rates back to the water column are also variable but only range between 0 and 25 Daphnia/m(2). Because annual variation in the size of the overwintering water-column population ranges between 0 and 2.5 individuals/L, the contribution of emergence to the development of the spring population is considerable in some years and negligible in others. Despite similar maximum water-column densities, D. pulicaria produces and stores more eggs and has a higher rate of emergence than D. galeata mendotae, suggesting differences in the benthic-pelagic link of these two species. Diapausing eggs greatly increase the generation time of the populations that produce them and therefore have the potential to substantially alter the outcome of community interactions.																	0012-9658					JUL	1998	79	5					1699	1710		10.1890/0012-9658(1998)079[1699:IVITAP]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000074853000020						
J	Saunders, DS; Hayward, SAL				Saunders, DS; Hayward, SAL			Geographical and diapause-related cold tolerance in the blow fly, Calliphora vicina	JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY												Three geographical strains of the blow fly, Calliphora vicina, were tested for cold tolerance at 0 degrees, - 4 degrees and - 8 degrees C. Survival to eclosion after 1 to 18 days of cold exposure was greater for diapause-destined larvae than for nondiapause-destined larvae of the two northern strains (Nallikari, Finland 65 degrees N and Edinburgh, Scotland 55 degrees N) but not for the southernmost strain (Barga, Italy 44 degrees N) where no clear differences were apparent. Diapause-destined larvae of the Edinburgh strain were more cold tolerant than those from Nallikari, at both - 4 degrees and - 8 degrees C, a difference possibly attributable to the long-lasting snow cover in the more northern locality, which might insulate the overwintering soil microclimate. At 0 degrees C, however, Nallikari larvae were more cold tolerant than Edinburgh or Barga. This was also the case for nondiapause-destined larvae, indicating that cold tolerance may occur, in part, independently of the diapause programme. In all three strains diapausing larvae were more cold tolerant than same-age (nondiapausing) pupae. For Nallikari, but not Barga, wandering larvae from short-day exposed flies, therefore initially programmed for diapause, but diverted from the diapause pathway by larval breeding at 19 degrees C, were significantly more cold tolerant than nondiapause larvae from long-day parents, indicating some maternal regulation of larval cold tolerance. There was, however, no evidence for an additional cold hardiness in larvae acclimatised to cold by a gradual reduction of temperature. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Saunders, DK; Patel, KH				Saunders, DK; Patel, KH			Comparison of blood viscosity in red-eared sliders (Trachemys scripta) adapted to cold and room temperature	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL ZOOLOGY												Red-eared sliders (Trachemys scripta) in their northern range undergo hibernation at temperatures of about 5 degrees C, which may result in a profound bradycardia and a drop in blood pressure leading to very slow blood flows. Blood viscosity increases with decreasing temperature and at low shear rates associated with slow blood flows. To investigate the effects of temperature on the blood viscosity of these animals, 20 red-eared sliders were randomly assigned to each of two groups, cold environment (5 degrees C) or room-temperature environment (25 degrees C). At the end of 5 months treatment, hematocrit values, plasma protein concentration, and whole-blood viscosity values were determined for each turtle. Blood viscosity measurements were determined at five shear rates (3.75, 15, 30, 75, and 150 s(-1)) at 5 degrees C and 25 degrees C for all animals. No significant differences were found in hematocrit or plasma protein values between cold-adapted and room temperature-adapted animals. Whole-blood viscosity between groups at any shear rate at a temperature of 5 degrees C was also nonsignificant. The only significant difference in blood viscosity between turtles adapted to cold and room temperature occurred at a shear rate of 3.75 s(-1) at 25 degrees C. The whole-blood viscosity of red-eared sliders, whether adapted to cold or to room temperature, tended to be lower as compared to other vertebrates under similar conditions of temperature, shear rate, and hematocrit. This innate lower blood viscosity may compensate for the potential detrimental effects on blood viscosity brought about by the low temperatures and decreased shear rates that occur in these animals during hibernation.

J	Ishihara, M				Ishihara, M			Geographical variation in insect developmental period: effect of host plant phenology on the life cycle of the bruchid seed feeder Kytorhinus sharpianus	ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA												The voltinism of the bruchid Kytorhinus sharpianus Bridwell (Coleoptera: Bruchidae) and the phenology of its host plant Sophora flavescens Aiton (Leguminosae) were observed at four latitudes: Aomori (40 degrees 46' N), Obanazawa (38 degrees 37' N), Kujiranami (37 degrees 21' N) and Mitsuma (36 degrees 05' N) in northeastern Honshu (Japan). Kytorhinus sharpianus life cycle ranged from bivoltine and partially trivoltine in the south to univoltine and partially bivoltine in the north. Sophora flavescens started growing later in spring at higher latitudes. However, the relative growth rate was higher in the north (Aomori) than in the south (Mitsuma). Ir parallel with this, the first-generation of adult K. sharpianus appeared later at higher latitudes. When the four local populations were reared at 24 degrees C, L16:D8 and 65% r.h., males developed faster than females. The mean developmental time showed a saw-toothed latitudinal dine. The reversion in the latitudinal trend of variation corresponded to the change :in the major type of life cycles from univoltine to bivoltine. Two heat units throughout the year and post-fruiting period were calculated as the sums of degree-days above the developmental threshold (12 degrees C) of K, sharpianus. Both heat units decreased in parallel with each other with increasing latitude. The greater growth rate of hosts in the northern population compensated for the smaller heat units. In addition, when the heat units were divided by the degree-days needed to complete development, the numerical value was the approximate number of generations observed in each locality.																	0013-8703	1570-7458				JUN	1998	87	3					311	319		10.1046/j.1570-7458.1998.00336.x								WOS:000074964100011

Parental strains, F-1, F-1r (reciprocal), F-2, backcross, and backcross reciprocal generations were used in a line-cross (generation means) analysis. This analysis revealed both additive and epistatic effects as important determinants of variation in ovariole number when larvae were reared at 25 degrees C. Maternal effects and maternal-by-progeny genetic interactions were not significant. These results are comparable to previous studies that document epistatic components as genetic determinants of ovariole number in D. melanogaster. Parallel studies on ovariole number in D. hibisci parental and hybrid generations (F-1 and F-1r,) reared as larvae at three temperatures (18 degrees, 21.5 degrees, and 25 degrees C) showed environmental effects and genotype-by-environment interactions as significant influences on the phenotype. Maternal effects were present when temperature of larval development was considered and significant, nonlinear environmental effects were detected. Field collections of D, hibisci females showed that held conditions result in significant departure of ovariole number from comparable laboratory reared females. The significant epistatic genetic effects, genotype-by-environment interactions, and maternal effects indicate that the genetic architecture of traits, such as ovariole number, may be more complex than often acknowledged and thus may be compatible with Wright's view of a netlike relationship between the genome and complex characters (Wright 1968).																	0014-3820					JUN	1998	52	3					806	815		10.1111/j.1558-5646.1998.tb03704.x								WOS:000074621000015	28565243					
J	Diemer, M				Diemer, M			Life span and dynamics of leaves of herbaceous perennials in high-elevation environments: 'news from the elephant's leg'	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												1. Leaf life spans, determined as half-lives, of 16 herbaceous perennial plant species from the aseasonal, tropical Andes at altitudes between 4000 and 4600 m were on average 193 +/- 19 days and thus two to three times greater than those of herbaceous perennials from the seasonal northern hemisphere. The duration of lamina expansion was positively correlated with life span. Growth was continuous all year round, but rates of leaf initiation in the high-elevation tropics were lower than in the temperate zone. 2. Significant positive inter-relationships were found between leaf life span and mass based foliar nitrogen concentration of Andean taxa. The correlation between life span and leaf mass per area (LMA) was marginally significant, while life span and area-based foliar N content were unrelated. 3, Leaf traits of 46 Andean herbaceous perennials (forbs and graminoids), spanning an altitudinal range of 1500 m, indicated that the 16 taxa utilized for growth and leaf life span determinations were representative. For graminoids no altitudinal changes in LMA or foliar N were observed across species. However, in forbs LMA and area-based foliar N increased significantly with altitude. No differences in leaf traits were observed between herbaceous rosette and cushion growth forms. 4, The Andean data set was used in conjunction with data from the temperate, sub-arctic and arctic zones to evaluate the significance of leaf life spans in herbaceous plants from a biogeographical perspective. Leaf life span declined significantly with increasing seasonality, expressed as latitude and duration of the annual growth period. Because temperature regimes are similar along this gradient during the respective growth periods (Diemer 1996), observed differences should be the result of variation in the day length and/or duration of the growing season. 5. Data on leaf life spans and leaf traits of herbaceous plants from contrasting latitudes were used to evaluate the validity of general inter-relationships proposed by Reich (1993). The high correlation between LMA and life span observed in both data sets indicates that this relationship holds for various growth forms. On the other hand, the apportionment of mass-based foliar N concentration in relation to life span appears to differ between herbaceous and woody growth forms.																	0269-8463					JUN	1998	12	3					413	425		10.1046/j.1365-2435.1998.00207.x								WOS:000074764200011						
J	Leishman, MR; Westoby, M				Leishman, MR; Westoby, M			Seed size and shape are not related to persistence in soil in Australia in the same way as in Britain	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												1. Previous studies have shown that among British species, seeds that persist in the soil tend to be small and compact compared with non-persistent seeds. We tested whether or not this pattern is repeated among 101 Australian species, from a range of habitats. 2. Seed mass was plotted against variance of seed dimensions, across all species. Species with persistent seeds were found across the whole range of seed mass (0.217-648.9 mg) and variance (0.0000-0.2497), providing no evidence for a critical mass or variance which separated persistent from transient seeds. 3. We tested whether or not divergence within individual clades between persistent and transient seeds was associated with increased seed mass or seed dimension variance, using phylogenetically independent contrasts (PICs). Their was no consistent tendency found. 4. Thus for Australian species, persistent seeds were not smaller or more compact than transient seeds when compared across all species or when compared using PICs. Presumably the natural history of burial and disturbance operates differently in British and Australian habitats.

J	Scriber, JM				Scriber, JM			The inheritance of diagnostic larval traits for interspecific hybrids of Papilio canadensis and P-glaucus (Lepidoptera : Papilionidae)	GREAT LAKES ENTOMOLOGIST												Traits distinguishing the closely related tiger swallowtail butterfly species, Papilio canadensis and P. glaucus, include fixed differences in diagnostic sex-linked and autosomal allozymes as well as sex-linked diapause regulation, and sex-linked differences in oviposition behavior. Larval detoxification abilities for plants of the Salicaceae and Magnoliaceae families are dramatically different and basically diagnostic as well. The distinguishing morphological traits of the adults and larvae have not been genetically characterized. Here we describe the segregation of diagnostic larval banding traits in offspring from the 2 species in their hybrid and reciprocal backcross combinations. Elucidation of genetic basis, and linkage relationships of a suite of distinguishing biochemical, physiological, morphological, and ecological traits with regard to their geographic concordance across the hybrid zone is fundamental to understanding the pattern and process of speciation.																	0090-0222					SUM	1998	31	2					113	123										WOS:000077168300004

It has a very rapid emergence and early tuber set. The vine maturity is similar to Superior in the absence of severe stress. In New York trials harvested 90 days after planting, the yields of Andover and Superior are nearly equal, 274 cwt/A. At 120 days, over eight seasons at two Ithaca locations, Andover yielded 87% Atlantic. Andover appears to be susceptible to drought and heat stress which can cause early senescence and reduce late season yields. It has few external and internal defects. Specific gravity is high for an early variety, being .009 less than Atlantic. Andover has excellent chip color from the field from a range of environments and from 7 C storage. It has good boiling and baking properties. The mealiness of the baked potatoes is especially good. Tuber dormancy is two weeks longer than Atlantic. The reaction to common scab is Like that of Monona, which is considered to be resistant. It is also resistant to powdery scab and the golden nematode.																	0003-0589					MAY-JUN	1998	75	3					113	116		10.1007/BF02895844								WOS:000074447600001						
J	Yoshio, M; Ishii, M				Yoshio, M; Ishii, M			Geographical variation of pupal diapause in the great mormon butterfly, Papilio memnon L (Lepidoptera : Papilionidae), in western Japan	APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY												The distribution of the great mormon butterfly, Papilio memnon L., has been expanding to northeastern areas in the Kinki district in western Japan. To investigate the relationship between the phenomenon and characteristics of diapause of this species, the photoperiodic response of 4 Japanese populations including the subtropical and northernmost ones was examined. The critical photoperiod for inducing diapause at 20 degrees C was 12 h 30 min in a subtropical population in Naze City (28 degrees 23'N), and about 13 h in temperate populations in Kagoshima(31 degrees 36'N), Wakayama (34 degrees 11'N), and Mine (34 degrees 54'N) Cities. Latitudinal variation was not found in diapause intensity (94-111 days) among the 3 temperate populations. However, diapause incidence at 13.5L-10.5D, which is slightly longer than the critical photoperiod, increased with latitude of the locality, and the deepest diapause was observed in some individuals in the Mine population. Nevertheless, the differences in critical photoperiod and diapause intensity among populations was smaller than that among broods in each population. As it appears to be difficult to explain the recent northward invasion of this species only by this slight change in diapause trait, the influence of climatic warming on the phenomenon is also discussed.																	0003-6862					MAY	1998	33	2					281	288		10.1303/aez.33.281								WOS:000074413800015						
J	Bushar, LM; Reinert, HK; Gelbert, L				Bushar, LM; Reinert, HK; Gelbert, L			Genetic variation and gene flow within and between local populations of the timber rattlesnake, Crotalus horridus	COPEIA												Primers designed to amplify four microsatellite loci were used to screen 32 timber rattlesnakes (Crotalus horridus) representing five geographically distinct hibernacula within a 6000-ha area. Average heterozygosity at these loci approached 50% for the total sample of 32 individuals; therefore, these markers detected considerable genetic variation. Individuals using the same hibernaculum were more closely related to each other than they were to randomly selected individuals from the study site. In general, as geographic distance between hibernacula increased, genetic distance increased, and gene flow decreased; however, in some cases genetic distance did not correlate with geographic distance. Analysis of the movements of radiotracked snakes confirmed that patterns of gene flow depended upon specific structural habitat features and were not simply related to the geographic distance between hibernacula. The location of suitable basking habitat appeared to influence the direction of movements and the distribution of alleles. These results suggest that isolated hibernacula or a small number of hibernacula are the demographic units of C. horridus within this study site. We found evidence for the possible existence of nonamplifying ("null") alleles for one of these loci (7-144), suggesting the importance of screening for null alleles before carrying out microsatellite analysis of a population.																	0045-8511					MAY 1	1998		2					411	422		10.2307/1447435								WOS:000073640000012						
J	Topp, W; Smetana, A				Topp, W; Smetana, A			Distributional pattern and development of the winter-active beetle Quedius pellax (Staphylinidae)	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY												The distributional range of Quedius pellax Smetana stretches along the Pacific Coast of North America from southern California north to southern British Columbia. This area is characterized by its humid climate and the relatively low summer and high winter temperatures. Within its distributional range Q. pellax is confined to dense forest habitats where extreme temperatures are lower than in open sites. Females of Quedius pellax were found to reproduce during autumn and winter months. Under controlled laboratory conditions development of the pre-imaginal stages (eggs, 1-3 larval stages, pupae) occurred in a narrow temperature range of 5-15 degrees C. Under short day conditions (SD 8/16) preimaginal development lasted 355d at 5 degrees C, 125d at 10 degrees C, and 81d at 15 degrees C. Under long day conditions (LD 16/8 at 15 degrees C) the pre-imaginal development was shortened to 68d. The accelerated development was mainly due to the photoperiodic sensitivity of the third larval stage. Theoretical thermal thresholds for development were found to be at 1.8 degrees C under short day and 4.2 degrees C under long day conditions.																	1466-822X					MAY	1998	7	3					189	195										WOS:000075633900004

Hexamerins are abundant in the hemolymph of late larval and early pupal stages, and gradually decline during metamorphosis and adult development. Three hexamerins in the 70 kDa range have been found (Hex-70a, Hex70b, Hex70c). In worker and drone, Hex70a is the only hexamerin present in large amount in later adult stages. Hex70b and c exhibit a similar developmental profile, disappearing in the drone just before adult emergence, and in the worker just after. Hex70b or Hex70c are still detectable in the adult queen. Hex80/110 likely exist in at least 3 different subunits, 1 of 110 kDa, and 2 of around 80 kDa, which all share a common N-terminus. They disappear during metamorphosis earlier than Hex70b and c. All these hexamerins have been found also in the antenna, suggesting their utilization in building up of antennal cuticle structures. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Familial Hibernian fever (FHF) has been described in only one United Kingdom based family, but two other Irish families have been found with similar clinical features. FHF resembles familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) in several clinical features, but the mode of inheritance of FHF is dominant whereas FMF is recessive. We have investigated whether autosomal dominant periodic fevers, in particular FHF, map to the FMF susceptibility locus (MEFV) on chromosome 16p13.3. We have used informative microsatellite markers flanking this locus to genotype members of the three families mentioned above. Two point and multipoint lod scores definitively excluded linkage to MEFV in the two larger families. A haplotype study confirmed these findings, indicating that FHF is genotypically as well as phenotypically distinct from FMF.

Three hundred twelve ewes born from 18 males and with known genealogy were sampled at the summer and the winter solstices. The nocturnal plasma melatonin concentration was defined as the mean of four plasma samples taken at hourly intervals in the middle of the night (2200-0200). Identity of the father (P < 0.001) and the solstice (P < 0.05) were significant. Melatonin concentrations varied considerably among individuals [338.4 +/- 197.5 (SD) pg/ml; range 26.6-981.3 pg/ml] and between rams regarding the melatonin concentrations of their daughters (range from 202.9 to 456.3 pg/ml). Inheritance was analyzed by a statistical model that allows discrimination of genetic effects from nongenetic effects and that estimates repeatability and heritability coefficients. Both the repeatability coefficient between solstices (0.60) and heritability coefficient [0.45 +/- 0.07 (SE)] were high. These results demonstrate that the variability in plasma melatonin concentration in ewes is under strong genetic control.

J	Spieth, HR; Cordes, RG; Dorka, M				Spieth, HR; Cordes, RG; Dorka, M			Flight directions in the migratory butterfly Pieris brassicae: Results from semi-natural experiments	ETHOLOGY												A recently developed experimental set-up has been used to test the constancy of flight direction in the large white butterfly Pieris brassicae, originally collected in Northern Germany. The night direction, tested with virgin females, depends on the developmental mode. Butterflies from diapause pupae fly north, those from subitan pupae fly south. The constancy of the flight direction has been examined in detail with the spring generation over a period of 14 d. The preferred direction does not change with advancing age and is essentially not influenced by temperature or by the sun's azimuth. The night activity, however, increases with temperature, but this is concealed by an intrinsic response resulting in a diurnal peak of night activity at 10.00-11.00 hours, long before the maximum temperature of the day is reached. Whether the observed direction can be considered as a parameter of migration behaviour is discussed. It is shown that migration in Pieris brassicae does not end with reproductive maturity but lasts throughout the entire imaginal stage.																	0179-1613					APR	1998	104	4					339	352										WOS:000073345800006						
J	Venable, DL; Dyreson, E; Pinero, D; Becerra, JX				Venable, DL; Dyreson, E; Pinero, D; Becerra, JX			Seed morphometrics and adaptive geographic differentiation	EVOLUTION												Adaptive geographic differentiation is documented for seed morphology of 36 populations of Heterosperma pinnatum Cav. (Asteraceae), a seed heteromorphic annual plant in the central highlands of Mexico. Achenes (single-seeded fruits) vary continuously within heads but are classified by shape and position as central, intermediate, or peripheral morphs and as having adhesive awns or not. Here we quantify shape as a principal component score contrasting log length and width of achenes. Heads and their variation among populations are described in terms of maximum, minimum, and range of shape scores; the number of achenes per head; quantitative indices of the abruptness of shape shift; where in the head the most abrupt change in shape occurs; and what achene shapes have awns. First and second principal components of these descriptors summarize 86% of among-population variation in achene and head morphology and correlate strongly with percent central achenes per head (%C) and percent of achenes with awns (%A), respectively. Awns are associated with greater dispersibility and achene shape is correlated with speed of dormancy loss. We hypothesized that dispersal morphology would be associated with vegetation attributes indicative of population ephemerality and that dormancy morphology would be associated with precipitation patterns during the early germination season. Morphological distance matrices were calculated using Euclidean distances among populations in %A and %C. Geographic distances among populations were calculated, as were genetic distances based on isozyme frequencies from 29 bands of six enzymes. Vegetation was classified as open or closed and early spring (germination season) and summer precipitation means were determined for each site. Closed vegetation was assumed to provide only ephemeral habitats for H. pinnatum. Partial matrix correlations between morphology and environment controlled for geographic but not genetic distance among sites, since the latter was not significantly correlated with either morphology or geography. A significant relationship was found between %A and closed vegetation, lower spring, and higher summer precipitation. %C was only correlated with lower spring precipitation. Independence of isozyme and morphological traits is interpreted in terms of selection on the latter but not the former.

We investigated thermoregulation, energetics and patterns of torpor in the northern blossom-bat Macroglossus minimus (16 g) to test whether physiological variables may explain why its range is limited to tropical regions. Normothermic bats showed a large variation in body temperature (T-b) (33 to 37 degrees C) over a wide range of ambient temperatures (T(a)s) and a relatively low basal metabolic rate (1.29 mi O-2 g(-1) h(-1)). Bats entered torpor frequently in the laboratory at T(a)s between 14 and 25 degrees C. Entry into torpor always occurred when lights were switched on in the morning, independent of T-a. MRs during torpor were reduced to about 20-40% of normothermic bats and T(b)s were regulated at a minimum of 23.1 +/- 1.4 degrees C. The duration of torpor bouts increased with decreasing T-a in non-thermoregulating bats, but generally terminated after Sh in thermoregulating torpid bats. Both the mean minimum T-b and MR of torpid M. minimus were higher than that predicted for a 16-g daily heterotherm and the T-b was also about 5 degrees C higher than that of the common blossom-bat Syconycteris australis, which has a more subtropical distribution. These observations suggest that variables associated with torpor are affected by T-a and that the restriction to tropical areas in M. minimus to some extent may be due to their ability to enter only very shallow daily torpor.																	0174-1578	1432-136X				APR	1998	168	3					233	239		10.1007/s003600050141								WOS:000073264300011	9591364

Times for 99% mortality (LT(99)s) in cold storage (0.5-4 degrees C) following the fumigation treatment varied between 11.9 d (0.5 degrees C) and 12.8 d (4 degrees C) and were not significantly different. LT99 for 1-d-old eggs in cold storage only varied between 19.4 d (4 degrees C) and 26.7 d (0.5 degrees C) and were not significantly different.

J	Wayne, PM; Reekie, EG; Bazzaz, FA				Wayne, PM; Reekie, EG; Bazzaz, FA			Elevated CO2 ameliorates birch response to high temperature and frost stress: implications for modeling climate-induced geographic range shifts	OECOLOGIA												Despite predictions that both atmospheric CO2 concentrations and air temperature will rise together, very limited data are currently available to assess the possible interactive effects of these two global change factors on temperate forest tree species. Using yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis) as a model species, we studied how elevated CO2 (800 vs. 400 mu l l(-1)) influences seedling growth and physiological responses to a 5 degrees C increase in summer air temperatures (31/26 vs. 26/21 degrees C day/night), and how both elevated CO2 and air temperature during the growing season influence seedling ability to survive freezing stress during the winter dormant season. Our results show that while increased temperature decreases seedling growth, temperature-induced growth reductions are significantly lower at elevated CO2 concentrations (43% vs. 73%). The amelioration of high-temperature stress was related to CO2-induced reductions in both whole-shoot dark respiration and transpiration. Our results also show that increased summer air temperature, and to a lesser degree CO2 concentration, make dormant winter buds less susceptible to freezing stress. We show the relevance of these results to models used to predict how climate change will influence future forest species distribution and productivity, without considering the direct or interactive effects of CO2.																	0029-8549					APR	1998	114	3					335	342		10.1007/s004420050455								WOS:000073400700006	28307776					
J	Turnock, WJ; Boivin, G; Ring, RA				Turnock, WJ; Boivin, G; Ring, RA			Interpopulation differences in the coldhardiness of Delia radicum (Diptera : Anthomyiidae)	CANADIAN ENTOMOLOGIST												The cabbage root maggot, Delia radicum (L.), was introduced to North America in the mid-1800s, likely from northwestern Europe, and probably reached Quebec and British Columbia before 1885 and Manitoba by 1922. The mean temperature of crystallization (Tc) for overwintering pupae was -22.8 +/- 1.2 degrees C for the St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec, population and -23.8 +/- 0.7 degrees C for the Vancouver, British Columbia, population. The mean Tc for these two populations and for Winnipeg, Manitoba (-24.4 degrees C), Ascot, England (-22.8 degrees C), Tallinn, Estonia (-25.2 degrees C), and St. Petersburg, Russia (ca. -20 degrees C), did not show any relation to mean January temperatures. These locations represent both temperate oceanic and temperate continental climates and a range of mean January temperatures from +4.6 to -17.7 degrees C. Survival of puparia from St-Jean-sur-Richelieu exposed to nonfreezing temperatures decreased as temperature decreased and exposure time lengthened. The parameters for the regression equations describing this relationship were similar to those describing the Winnipeg population, and both were more coldhardy than the Ascot population. The upper limit of the cold injury zone (ULCIZ) for the St-Jean-sur-Richelieu population was -12.7 degrees C and the lower limit of this zone (LLCIZ) was -27.6 degrees C. Coldhardy populations from temperate continental climates (St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Winnipeg) showed a rate of decrease in survival with increased cold stress (lower temperature, longer exposure) within the cold injury zone which was much slower than in the less coldhardy population (Ascot). Thus, some individuals from the coldhardy populations would be physiologically capable of surviving exposure to temperatures below Tc, whereas in the Ascot population nonfreezing injury would kill all the overwintering puparia at a temperature (-19.6 degrees C) well above Tc (-22.8 degrees C). The observed survival of puparia from Vancouver, following various nonfreezing exposures, resembled more closely the calculated survival for these exposures when the equations describing the Ascot population were used than when the equations for Winnipeg or St-Jean-sur-Richelieu were used. The Ascot and Vancouver populations, both from temperate oceanic climates, are less coldhardy than the populations from St-Jean-sur-Richelieu and Winnipeg (temperate continental climates). The founder populations of D. radicum in North America, which probably originated in the temperate oceanic climates of northwestern Europe, have adapted to the colder temperate continental climates by increasing their ability to survive longer exposures to all temperatures within the cold injury zone and not by lowering Tc. Therefore, selection for coldhardiness in D. radicum must have operated on structures, processes, or physiological-biochemical mechanisms that help the organism to avoid or repair nonfreezing cold injury but not on those that determine Tc.																	0008-347X					MAR-APR	1998	130	2					119	129		10.4039/Ent130119-2								WOS:000073860600001						
J	Hackett, C; Vanclay, JK				Hackett, C; Vanclay, JK			Mobilizing expert knowledge of tree growth with the PLANTGRO and INFER systems	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												PLANTGRO can provide estimates of plant and tree growth under a wide range of conditions by evaluating responses to some 20 environmental variables ranging from day length to soil pH and determining the limiting factor. Although intended only to indicate the suitability of a given site-species combination, empirical trials suggest that the suitability index provides a reasonable indication of growth potential, offering correlations with height growth as high as 80%. PLANTGRO can be calibrated for new situations by providing appropriate soil, climate and species files. These can be compiled from plot-based data, casual observations, or expert knowledge. INFER is an expert system which complements PLANTGRO by providing an objective framework to elucidate plant growth details from casual observations. Together, INFER and PLANTGRO offer an effective way to provide initial growth estimates for species-site combinations not covered by plot data or other models. PLANTGRO is available from C.

Samples representing stages of plant maturity from early vegetative to dormant were collected from grazed and ungrazed native tallgrass paddocks using a 0.5 x 0.5 m quadrat. Total biomass was measured during all years of the study (1992-1995). Grass and forb biomass were measured separately during 1995. Height of canopy closure also was measured during 1995. Before clipping, plots were scanned with a multispectral radiometer. Models were prepared using simple regression, multiple regression (MR), or a commercial neural network (NN) computer program. Potential inputs to MR and NN models of SFB and PCTF included Julian day of harvest (JD), range site, canopy closure height (CH), incident radiation, spectral reflectance values (RFV) at 8 discreet bandwidths, and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The NDVI alone accounted for little variability (R-2 = 0.13) in SFB during all years of the study. The optimal MR model for the same data set (SFB = 3.5[JD] -43.7[460 nm RFV] + 1099[NDVI] - 992; R-2 = 0.62) accounted for a greater amount of the variability in SFB. The capacity to describe variation in SFB for the 1995 data with MR was improved when CH was included as a variable (R-2 = 0.58 versus 0.78). A NN model accounted for the most variation in SFB across the entire study (R-2 = 0.76). During 1995, the capability of a NN to account for variation in SFB within the training data was similar whether or hot CH was included as an input (R-2 = 0.86); however, prediction of SFB from validation data using the same NN was improved by using CH as an input variable. Little variation in PCTF was accounted for by a MR model (R-2 = 0.23); however, a considerably larger proportion of the variation in PCTF was accounted for when an NN was used (R-2 = 0.59), Seasonal changes in SFB and PCTF were described with an acceptable degree of accuracy by forage reflectance characteristics that were adjusted for time of season and canopy complexity, Moreover, when provided with the same potential inputs, NN predicted SFB and PCTF from validation data more accurately than MR models.																	0022-409X					MAR	1998	51	2					186	192		10.2307/4003206								WOS:000072673700011						
J	Preston, KA				Preston, KA			Architectural constraints on flower number in a photoperiodic annual	OIKOS												Plant fecundity is typically correlated with size (e.g. biomass); however, in plants whose reproduction is meristem-limited, there should be a stronger relationship between fecundity and architecture (the number and arrangement of subunits, or modules, composing a plant). In a reciprocal common garden experiment, I measured the effects of latitude-dependent flowering date on fecundity, biomass, and architecture in a photoperiodic annual (Perilla frutescens) to test the hypothesis that branch number limits flower production. If it does, the relationship between architecture and fecundity should remain constant across environments, even if the size-fecundity relationship varies. I planted Perilla seedlings from populations at 39 degrees 15'N and 33 degrees 05'N into a common garden at each latitude. Plants within a garden flowered on the same day, two weeks earlier in the south than in the north. Within a garden, size and flower number were positively correlated, but the slope of the relationship differed between gardens: plants of a given size made more flowers in the south than in the north. By contrast, the relationship between architecture and flower number was constant both within and between gardens. These data suggest that in meristem;limited plants, architecture is better than biomass at predicting fecundity across environments. Considering architecture, in addition to plant size, should enhance our understanding of environmental effects on plants whose reproduction is potentially meristem-limited.																	0030-1299					MAR	1998	81	2					279	288		10.2307/3547048								WOS:000071918100007						
J	Takeda, M; Nagata, T				Takeda, M; Nagata, T			Effects of temperature and winter diapause on survival and development in bivoltine and trivoltine ecotypes of the rice stem maggot, Chlorops oryzae Matsumura (Diptera : Chloropidae), reared on a winter host	APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY												In Chlorops oryzae, winter diapause in the first larval stage is induced by short days in the egg stage and maintained by short days in the larval stage. On wheat plants (winter host), most diapause and non-diapause larvae failed to pupate and died within 50 days at 23 degrees C regardless of photoperiod. When diapause larvae were reared on wheat plants at 10, 15 or 20 degrees C under LD12 : 12, the survival rates increased with decreasing temperatures. Diapause development at 10 degrees C was completed about 70-90 and 40-50 days in the Akita (bivoltine, 39 degrees N) and Aichi (trivoltine, 35 degrees N) strains, respectively. The survival rates on wheat seedlings at 23 degrees C in diapausing larvae of the Akita strain increased with increasing periods of previous exposure to 10 degrees C from 41 to 80 days. Aichi larvae showed higher survival rates regardless of the period at 10 degrees C. It appears that low temperature promotes survival of the larvae on wheat plants, and larvae which complete diapause development can grow to the pupal stage on winter hosts.																	0003-6862					FEB	1998	33	1					85	96		10.1303/aez.33.85								WOS:000072714900012						
J	Blanckenhorn, WU				Blanckenhorn, WU			Altitudinal differentiation in the diapause response of two species of dung flies	ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												1. Seasonality is a prime selective factor promoting genetic differentiation of populations. Local adaptation in diapause response was investigated in the two geographically and altitudinally widespread dung flies Scathophaga stercoraria (Diptera: Scathophagidae) and Sepsis cynipsea (Diptera: Sepsidae). 2. Replicate sibships from three sites in Switzerland with low and high altitude dung fly populations were raised in a common laboratory environment simulating the natural decreasing photoperiod and temperature regimen before winter. From field phenologies, the critical photoperiod inducing diapause was predicted to be longer for high than for low altitude populations (12 vs. 10 h for Sc. stercoraria, and 12.25 vs. 11 h for Se. cynipsea) if they are locally adapted. 3. Contrary to expectation and to Sc. stercoraria, which diapauses in the pupal stage, Se. cynipsea diapauses in the adult stage. 4. Low but significant levels of genetic differentiation in pre-winter adult emergence were evident between low and high altitude populations of both species, but they were far from the differences predicted. Scathophaga stercoraria also showed geographical differentiation independent of altitude. 5. Sepsis cynipsea females stopped reproducing at some point before winter, but altitude did not affect the timing of adult diapause. High altitude females and females that did not initiate reproduction before winter survived the simulated winter better. 6. Both species largely used temperature rather than photoperiod as a cue inducing winter diapause, an untypical case of phenotypic plasticity. The hypothesis that Sc. stercoraria, whose generation times are much longer than those of Se. cynipsea, responds to a greater extent to temperature rather than photoperiod only was rejected.																	0307-6946					FEB	1998	23	1					1	8		10.1046/j.1365-2311.1998.00098.x								WOS:000072214100001

Lobesia botrana Dennis & Schiffermuller, were examined at several constant temperatures ranging From 8 to 34 degrees C by 2 degrees C increments, with a relative humidity of 65% and a photoperiod of 16:8 (L:D) h. Optimal temperatures for development rxnged from 28 to 30 degrees C. The lower and upper limits occurred between 8 and 12 degrees C and between 32 and 34 degrees C, respectively. The experimental conditions covering the complete temperature range for each stage allowed us to apply the data to 5 published equations describing the effect of constant temperatures on developmental rates of various insects. Criteria of choice from the literature were used to evaluate models and to select the most suitable equation for each developmental stage of L. botrana.																	0046-225X					FEB	1998	27	1					94	101		10.1093/ee/27.1.94								WOS:000073115900012

The birds from northern regions were more sensitive to 14-h photoperiods than in chaffinches from the local population of the Courish Spit (55 degrees N). The results of night-interruption experiments have revealed that in northern birds the peak of photosensitivity lies earlier in the night than that in local birds, which is consistent with population differences in spring migration.																	0044-5134					FEB	1998	77	2					252	254										WOS:000073352800015						
J	Hau, M; Wikelski, M; Wingfield, JC				Hau, M; Wikelski, M; Wingfield, JC			A neotropical forest bird can measure the slight changes in tropical photoperiod	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Many tropical birds breed seasonally, but it is largely unknown which environmental cues they use to time reproduction. Changes in tropical photoperiod have been regarded as too small to be used as a proximate environmental cue. This hypothesis, however, has never been rigorously tested. Here, we report on experimental evidence that photoperiodic changes characteristic of tropical latitudes stimulate reproductive activity in a neotropical bird from the forest understory. In the central Republic of Panama (9 degrees N), photoperiod varies annually between 12 hours (December) and 13 hours (June). Free-living spotted antbirds (Hylophylax n. naevioides) had regressed gonads in December, but increased gonads ahead of the rainy (the breeding) season in May Captive spotted antbirds exposed to a 'long' photoperiod of 13 hours increased gonadal size eight-fold and song activity six-fold over that of control birds remaining on a simulated 'short' photoperiod of 12 hours of daylight. Moreover, even a photoperiod of 12 hours 17 minutes was sufficient to stimulate gonadal growth in photostimulated birds over that of controls. The dramatic changes in gonadal development were not accompanied by similar changes in hormone titres such as luteinizing hormone and testosterone as expected from temperate zone birds. We propose a more general role of the tropical photoperiod in the regulation of seasonal events in tropical organisms, or in temperate zone species migrating to the tropics.																	0962-8452					JAN 22	1998	265	1391					89	95		10.1098/rspb.1998.0268								WOS:000071820400002						
J	John, TM; Liu, GY; Brown, GM				John, TM; Liu, GY; Brown, GM			60 Hz magnetic field exposure and urinary 6-sulphatoxymelatonin levels in the rat	BIOELECTROMAGNETICS												Four separate experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of extremely low frequency magnetic field (MF) exposure (60 Hz, 1 mT rms) on urinary 6-sulphatoxymelatonin (aMT6s) levels in Sprague-Dawley rats. In the first experiment, immature male rats maintained under a regular 12 h daily photoperiod (white fluorescent light) were exposed to a 20 h daily MF exposure for 6 weeks. The second experiment was similar to the first, except that the MF exposure was limited to 10 days. In the third experiment, adult male rats acclimated to a combination of continuous dim red light and regular 12 h daily photoperiod (white fluorescent) were subjected to a single 1 h exposure to intermittent MF (1 min on and 1 min off cycles), 2 h before fluorescent lights went off. The fourth experiment was similar to the third, except that the animals received 2 consecutive days of 20 h daily exposure to intermittent MF, beginning 1 h before the fluorescent lights went off each day. In all four experiments, the circadian profile of urinary aMT6s was examined before, during, and after the MF exposure. No significant effect of 1 mT MF on indoleamine metabolism was observed in any of the above experiments. However, in one of the experiments (no. 4), both the control and the MF groups showed a lower aMT6s level during the exposure days, when compared with that of pre-and post-exposure days, suggesting that the existence of possible effects with lower field strengths at the range of stray field cannot be ruled out.

J	Naulleau, G; Duguy, R; Saint Girons, H				Naulleau, G; Duguy, R; Saint Girons, H			Spatio-temporal aspects of the annual cycle of Viperinae	BULLETIN DE LA SOCIETE ZOOLOGIQUE DE FRANCE												The timing of different stages of the annual cycle of vipers - hibernation, mating, feeding and birth - varies according to weather conditions and, to a lesser extent, space available to the animals; only the date of ovulation is invariant. Utilisation of space depends essentially upon the physical structure of the habitat. If the habitat is homogeneous, vipers will spend the whole year in a very restricted home range as solitary individuals or as temporary couples. In heterogeneous habitats there is a tendency for the vipers to be grouped in sunnier and drier locations during winter and spring, and to disperse into damper situations in the summer months. This tendency is more frequent and noticeable in regions marked by long cold winters, where suitable deep hibernation sites are often rare, and spring basking thus becomes more necessary. The home range is thus divided into a small area utilised for hibernation, spring basking, mating and often gestation, and a much larger area used in summer for feeding by males and non-reproducing females. These two parts of the home range of each viper may be contiguous, or separated in space by a non-habitable zone which can extend for up to 1-2 kilometres.																	0037-962X						1998	123	1					53	60										WOS:000074318400005

Seed samples were taken from commercial seed fields, hay fields, and roadsides just before pod maturity. From sample lots of 250 pods, the numbers of healthy, chalcid-damaged, and frozen or immature seed were determined. Later, producers were questioned about the attributes of and management practices employed in their fields. Seed yields and infestation levels were correlated with temperature, precipitation, and degree-day data from the year of and the year preceding seed collection. Alfalfa seed chalcid infestation level was correlated most closely with the temperature and rainfall in July and August of both years. The proportion of damaged seed was highest the year following warm, dry summers. Alfalfa cultivar also influenced infestation levels; winter-hardy cultivars that became dormant early in the autumn had lower levels of chalcid-damaged seeds than less hardy cultivars which maintained growth later in the season. Management practices such as the use of insecticides (for plant bug and aphid control), fertilizers, and herbicides, size or age of field, soil type, and application of irrigation water did not affect the proportion of seeds injured by chalcids.																	0008-347X					JAN-FEB	1998	130	1					1	11										WOS:000073542600001

Demand-feeding behavior was continuously monitored over a complete annual cycle in 10 groups of 15 fish maintained in an outdoors laboratory subjected to natural fluctuations of photoperiod (from 9.5h to 15h) and water temperature (from 13.2 degrees C to 27.4 degrees C). A double seasonal phase inversion was detected in all groups: fish that were diurnal in summer and in autumn changed to nocturnal in winter and returned to being diurnal in spring. Diurnal sea bass displayed a positive and stable phase relationship between the peak of the feeding phase and the daily acrophase of water temperature (phi(l) = 0.72h +/- 0.33h) and between the peak of the feeding phase and sunset (phi(s) = 2.94h +/- 0.53h), but both phi(l) and phi(s) became negative when sea bass shifted to nocturnalism in winter. The percentage of diurnal feeding behavior peaked in June (94.1%) and dropped in February (29.1%), following a cyclic dynamic modulated by both monthly photoperiod and water temperature. These results contribute to better understanding of the dual phasing behavior of sea bass, which exhibits diurnal or nocturnal behavior according to the time of the year so that flexibility in phasing may be advantageous for the fish to cope with seasonal changes in their environment.

J	Reekie, EG				Reekie, EG			An experimental field study of the cost of reproduction in Plantago major L.	ECOSCIENCE												Plantago major is a variable species that occupies a wide range of open habitats with a herbaueous canopy. Previous studies have shown that individuals from habitats where the canopy is kept short by mowing have a higher reproductive allocation than individuals from habitats with a tall canopy. The present study was conducted to determine whether or not the cost of reproduction differed between these two habitats. Fifteen half-sibling families, selected from a ranee of habitats differing in canopy bright were grown in the laboratory. Reproduction was controlled experimentally by photoperiod manipulations, and vegetative and reproductive plants of each family were transplanted to either a mown (short canopy) or unmown (tall canopy) grass sward in the fall of the first year. Number of leaves, length and width of largest leaf, and capsule production were monitored over the next 18 months. Total shoot biomass was determined at the end of this period. Cost of reproduction was assessed in threeways, by i) comparing the subsequent performance of vegetative and reproductive individuals, ii) calculating the phenotypic correlation between reproductive output in the first year of growth and subsequent performance using only those individuals that reproduced in the first year, and iii) calculating the above correlations at the among family level. Regardless of method used, cost of reproduction was smaller in the mown than in the unmown plots, suggesting that differences in cost among habitats may be involved in selecting for different allocation patterns.																	1195-6860						1998	5	2					200	206		10.1080/11956860.1998.11682458								WOS:000075128800008

J	Takeda, M				Takeda, M			Genetic basis of photoperiodic control of summer and winter diapause in geographic ecotypes of the rice stem maggot, Chlorops oryzae	ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA												Chlorops oryzae Matsumura (Diptera: Chloropidae) is bivoltine in northern Japan but trivoltine in the southern part of the country. Larvae of the bivoltine strain (Akita, 39 degrees N) develop without delay under L14:D10 but enter summer diapause in the mature larval stage under L15:D9. In contrast, larvae of the trivoltine strain (Aichi, 35 degrees N) develop quickly under L15:D9 but enter summer diapause under L14:D10. The genetic basis of their different summer-diapause behavior was analyzed by reciprocal crossing between the two ecotypes and backcrossing to the hybrids. Although a polygenic system seems to be involved, there is a single gene on the X-chromosome exerting a major effect on summer diapause. The northern bivoltine ecotype has a longer critical photoperiod for the induction of winter diapause in the first larval stage and remains in diapause longer than the southern trivoltine ecotype. The differences in the critical photoperiod and the winter diapause duration between the two ecotypes seem to be controlled by a polygenic system but again a sex-linked or closely linked gene (or genes) plays a major role. The two geographic ecotypes differ significantly in summer- and winter-diapause traits, both of which are characterized by sex-linked inheritance. Despite this, no apparent sterility or inviability in hybrids between the ecotypes occurs.																	0013-8703					JAN	1998	86	1					59	70		10.1046/j.1570-7458.1998.00265.x								WOS:000071957700006

J	Richards, MH; Packer, L				Richards, MH; Packer, L			Demography and relatedness in multiple-foundress nests of the social sweat bee, Halictus ligatus	INSECTES SOCIAUX												Female sweat bees in the species Halictus ligatus exhibit a wide range of reproductive roles, ranging from typically foundress or queen-like to typically worker-like. Nests are founded in spring and most are haplometrotic, that is, founded by a single foundress. A few (up to 12%) are pleometrotic, founded by 2-6 foundresses. Variation in the proportion of multifoundress nests from year to year and from place to place suggests an adaptive basis for pleometrosis. We studied the demographic and social characteristics of 23 pleometrotic nests in an aggregation of 250-300 nests near Victoria, Ontario, in 1984, 1990, and 1991. In pleometrotic associations, dominant foundresses behaved in a manner typical of mid-summer, haplometrotic queens, while subordinates behaved like mid-summer workers. Dominant foundresses tended to be larger than subordinates. Pleometrotic nests were significantly more likely than haplometrotic nests to produce brood, and they also produced more workers. However, this early advantage did not result in the production of more reproductive brood per nest, nor did pleometrotic foundresses experience higher productivity per foundress than did haplometrotic foundresses. Relatively low relatedness among various categories of brood implied that subordinate foundresses were not closely related to dominants. We suggest that pleometrosis most likely results from accidental encounters between spring foundresses as they leave their hibernacula. Once formed, such associations confer a survival advantage on the nest as a whole, but do not result in greater reproductive brood productivity.

Mechanisms and determinants of these variations are not yet clearly explained. These could be external features (environmental changes) or internal features (disease, parasitism, metapopulational evolution). We have developed a realistic simulation program, named DYNISO, which is able to reproduce the individual life history of terrestrial isopods according to abiotic factors (photoperiod, thermoperiod) and biotic factors (sexual interactions, incidence of parasitism, sex ratio distorters, etc.). In the model, all biological traits-such as growth, reproduction, reactivity to environment, and death-are user-defined. In this study, we present some features concerning the life histories of female isopods and their implications for population dynamics. We show the capability of the model to test genotypes in different geographic locations.																	0021-2210						1998	44	3-4					423	437										WOS:000077700100018						
J	Gotthard, K				Gotthard, K			Life history plasticity in the satyrine butterfly Lasiommata petropolitana: investigating an adaptive reaction norm	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY												This study addresses the general hypothesis that insects living in seasonal environments should shorten development times at progressively later dates in the growth season, and that insects living outside equatorial areas should use daylength as a cue to determine the date. Diapause strategies and reaction norms relating the duration of larval development to daylength was investigated in a French population of the butterfly, Lasiommata petropolitana. The results are compared with those of an earlier study of the species in Sweden. Because of the diapausing strategy and phenology of the population, it was expected that an adaptive reaction norm relating larval time to daylength should have a positive slope, i.e. relatively shorter daylengths induce faster growth and development. This prediction was supported, and the reaction norm was qualitatively similar to the one found in Swedish populations. In the French population it was, however, shifted to a range of shorter photoperiods which corresponds to the regime of shorter daylengths in southern Europe. Shorter larval development times and high growth rates were associated with a reduction in pupal size, suggesting a trade off between time and size at pupation. There was no evidence of a trade off between growth rate and starvation endurance. The results suggests that the daylength-dependent decision of what growth trajectory an individual larva will follow, is not made continuously but rather at one or a few occasions during larval development. It is clear that larvae of L. petropolitana make developmental decisions in relation to the daylength they experience during larval growth. The result is a reaction norm that agrees closely to what is predicted by some life history models, suggesting that it is an adaptation for optimising life history traits in a seasonal environment.

A seed extraction and germination trial was conducted to determine the diversity, size, and germinability of the persistent seedbank. Seedling emergence was counted in a greenhouse, with and without a 14-day prechilling(3 to 5 degrees C) stratification treatment, to characterize seedbank dormancy. Fourteen grass species, 17 forb species, and Schweinitz flatsedge (Cyperus schweinitzii Torr.) were identified in the seed bank. Two additional genera (Carer and Euphorbia) also occurred in the seedbank. Only 10 species occurred in 8 or more macroplots in both years. Aboveground botanical composition was not correlated with (P > 0.10) seedbank species composition. More germinable seeds occurred in the 0 to 5 cm depth (P < 0.01) than the 15 to 20 cm depth. Also, the species diversity and seed number were greater in the shallower depth. Germination percentage was low for all types of vegetation. Lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.) and annual eriogonum (Eriogonum annuum Nutt) had the largest seedbanks, but germination was less than 6%. Sand dropseed [Sporobolus cryptandrus (Torr.) Gray] and sand lovegrass [Eragrostis trichodes (Nutt.) Wood] were the most abundant perennial grasses and accounted for about 60% of the germinated seeds. Prechilling increased seedling emergence of grasses CP < 0.01), forbs (P < 0.01), and grass-like species (P < 0.01). Perennial grasses emerged first, forbs later, and grasslike species exhibited a bimodal emergence pattern. Based on germination percentage and emergence data, sand dropseed has the potential to colonize openings in the Sandhills prairie, possibly to the exclusion of many annuals occurring in the seedbank.																	0022-409X					JAN	1998	51	1					55	62		10.2307/4003564								WOS:000071419200010						
J	Halonen, M; Kuitunen, M				Halonen, M; Kuitunen, M			Feeding time and brood rearing capacity in the Pied Flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca	ORNIS FENNICA												Lack (1947) suggested that one factor affecting clutch size in birds is the latitude at which the clutch is laid. He proposed that this geographical variation is partly influenced by latitudinal differences in day length. We studied the effect of reduced daily feeding time (day length) on the breeding success of the Pied Flycatcher, Ficedula hypoleuca, and whether parents were able to compensate for the lost feeding time. We kept both adults captive for 2-5 hours each day when the nestlings were from 8 to 13 days old and recorded the effects on the development of the offspring. The nestlings with reduced feeding time were lighter when fledging and had a lower expected survival rate than those of the control nests. The results indicate that the adults were unable to compensate for the lost feeding time, since the feeding rate did not differ between the experimental and control nests. Since some bird species feed the oldest nestling of the brood more frequently than the younger ones when they cannot find enough food for all the nestlings, we calculated the coefficient of variation (CV) for nestling weights for each brood. The results from this analysis suggested that all the nestlings within each brood developed in an almost identical manner. Our results suggest that day length may be critical for the ability of the parents to feed their nestlings, supporting Lack's findings that day length may influence geographical variation in brood size.																	0030-5685						1998	75	1					39	45										WOS:000073157300004

Of these, 2 dens were located during the late 1970s using radio-tracking, 1 den was located in 1989 by a different researcher, and 18 dens were located by the authors between 1988 and 1994. Two dens were excavated and 19 were in natural cavities. Bedding material in these dens consisted of nest-like beds (n = 15 dens), a hole dug in the earth (n = 2), bedding materials spread out on the ground (n = 3), and no bed in 1 excavated den. Nine dens showed signs of recent use. To determine factors bears use to select a hibernation site, characteristics (e.g., elevation, exposure, slope angle, and distance from sources of disturbance) were noted for 19 dens located in the area where bears are constantly present and compared with the same characteristics taken from 100 uniformly distributed sites in the same area. Elevation of the den sites ranged between 970-1940 m. The angle of the slopes on which the dens were located ranged between 28 degrees-60 degrees. Brown bears preferred den sites with southern exposure over those with a northern exposure and used slopes facing all cardinal compass directions.																			0-944740-07-3				1998	10						275	279										WOS:000080892300035						
J	Wilkinson, DA; Grigg, GC; Beard, LA				Wilkinson, DA; Grigg, GC; Beard, LA			Shelter selection and home range of echidnas, Tachyglossus aculeatus, in the highlands of south-east Queensland	WILDLIFE RESEARCH												We recorded physical attributes of sites used for daily shelter or as hibernacula by nine echidnas, Tachyglossus aculeatus, living on a sheep-grazing property in south-eastern Queensland. Home ranges were also determined. For daily shelter sites, echidnas most often used hollow logs and depressions under the roots of fallen trees. Daily shelters were found more often on north-facing slopes and usually provided >90% cover. Hibernation sites always provided 100% cover but, in contrast to dairy sites, were distributed randomly in relation to the slope of the terrain. Rabbit burrows, which offer much better thermal buffering than hollow logs, were used mast commonly as hibernacula. There were differences between individuals in the type of shelter they used and, moreover, echidnas did not use shelter sites in proportion to what was available, indicating that choice was being exercised. Re-use of sites occurred non-randomly, implying that echidnas can recognise previously used shelters and probably have a learned familiarity with their living area. Home ranges varied between 20.6 ha and 93.3 ha (mean = 49.8, s.d. = 25.4), overlapped with those of other echidnas and correlated positively with body weight.																	1035-3712						1998	25	3					219	232		10.1071/WR97072								WOS:000075263200001						
J	Mason, PG; Hopper, KR				Mason, PG; Hopper, KR			Temperature dependence in locomotion of the parasitoid Aphelinus asychis (Hymenoptera : Aphelinidae) from geographical regions with different climates	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												In biological control, introduction of insect agents from regions with similar climatic conditions to those of the target host habitat have been an important consideration for successful implementation. Yet, there is little documentation of genetic variation in response to climate among natural enemy populations. In experiments on Aphelinus asychis Walker collected from China France, and Morocco for release against Diuraphis noxia (Mordvilko) in North America, the relationship between locomotion (i.e., mean and maximum walking speeds and proportion of time walking) and temperature did not differ among geographical regions with different climates. Mean and maximum walking speeds increased with temperature from 8.5 to 28.5 degrees C. Mean walking speed increased with hind tibia length, and because hind tibia length varied among geographical regions, it was used as a covariate in analyses comparing regions. Our results suggest that although locomotion depended on temperature, this dependence has not led to selection for adaptation to different temperature regimes. Thus, for mean and maximum walking speeds and proportion of time walking, insects collected from all 3 geographical areas were suited to the same climate.

J	Feder, JL; Stolz, U; Lewis, KM; Perry, W; Roethele, JB; Rogers, A				Feder, JL; Stolz, U; Lewis, KM; Perry, W; Roethele, JB; Rogers, A			The effects of winter length on the genetics of apple and hawthorn races of Rhagoletis pomonella (Diptera : Tephritidae)	EVOLUTION												Host plant-associated fitness trade-offs are central to models of sympatric speciation proposed for certain phytophagous insects. But empirical evidence for such trade-offs is scant, which has called into question the likelihood of nonallopatric speciation. Here, we report on the second in a series of studies testing for host-related selection on pupal life-history characteristics of apple- (Malus pumila L.) and hawthorn- (Crataegus mollis L. spp.) infesting races of the Tephritid fruit fly, Rhagoletis pomonella (Walsh). In particular we examine the effects of winter length on the genetics of these flies. We have previously found that the earlier fruiting phenology of apple trees exposes apple-fly pupae to longer periods of warm weather preceding winter than hawthorn-fly pupae. Because R. pomonella has a facultative diapause, we hypothesized that this selects for pupae with more recalcitrant pupal diapauses (or slower metabolic/development rates) in the apple-fly race. A study in which we experimentally manipulated the length of the prewintering period for hawthorn-origin pupae supported this prediction. If the period preceding winter is important for apple-and hawthorn-fly pupae, then so too should be the length (duration) of winter; the rationale for this prediction is hat "fast developing" pupae that break diapause too early will deplete their energy reserves and disproportionately die during long winters. To test this possibility, we chilled apple-and hawthorn-origin pupae collected from a field site near Grant, Michigan, in a refrigerator at 4 degrees C for time periods ranging from one week to two years. Our a priori expectation was that longer periods of cold storage would select against allozyme markers that were associated with faster rates of development in our earlier study. Since these electromorphs are typically found at higher frequencies in hawthorn flies, extending the overwintering period should favor "apple-fly alleles" in both races, The results from this "overwinter" experiment supported the diapause hypothesis. The anticipated genetic response was observed in both apple and hawthorn races, as allele frequencies became significantly more "apple-fly-like" in eclosing adults surviving longer chilling periods. This indicates that it is the combination of environmental conditions before and during winter that selects an the host races, Many tests for trade-offs fail to adequately consider the interplay between insect development, host plant phenology, and local climatic conditions. Our findings suggest that such oversight may help to explain the paucity of reported fitness trade-offs.																	0014-3820					DEC	1997	51	6					1862	1876		10.2307/2411008								WOS:000071652200015	28565109					
J	Van Assche, JA; Van Nerum, DM				Van Assche, JA; Van Nerum, DM			The influence of the rate of temperature change on the activation of dormant seeds of Rumex obtusifolius L.	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												1. One temperature shift from 20 to 30 degrees C in darkness induces 30-40% germination in Rumex obtusifolius seeds. The same germination percentages are found with heat treatment varying between 1 and 6 h duration, indicating that the total heat sum of the temperature shift is not important. 2. Germination is greatly enhanced by three consecutive heat shifts of 1 h at 30 degrees C separated by 1 h periods at 20 degrees C. 3. The seeds are activated to a small extent after a slow warming (+2 degrees C h(-1)) from 20 to 30 degrees C, followed by incubation for 1 h at 30 degrees C. Germination is much higher after rapid heating (+10 degrees C h(-1)) to 30 degrees C, followed by Ih incubation at this temperature. Repeated fast heating treatments on four consecutive days enhances germination. Moderately rapid heatings (+3.3 degrees C h(-1)) give intermediate results. 4. The rate of cooling does not influence the germination percentage. Cooling alone cannot induce germination. 5. Heating alone from 15 to 25 degrees C without cooling also activates germination. In this temperature range the seeds are more activated by rapid warming than by slow warming. 6. The ecological relevance of the response to different warming rate is discussed. The insensitivity of seeds to a slow warming might keep deeply buried seeds in a dormant stage.																	0269-8463					DEC	1997	11	6					729	734										WOS:000071560300008						
J	Lair, KP; Bradshaw, WE; Holzapfel, CM				Lair, KP; Bradshaw, WE; Holzapfel, CM			Evolutionary divergence of the genetic architecture underlying photoperiodism in the pitcher-plant mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii	GENETICS												We determine the contribution of composite additive, dominance, and epistatic effects to the genetic divergence of photoperiodic response along latitudinal, altitudinal, and longitudinal gradients in the pitcher-plant mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii. Joint scaling tests of crosses between populations showed wide-spread epistasis as well as additive and dominance differences among populations. There were differences due to epistasis between an alpine population in North Carolina and populations in Florida, lowland North Carolina, and Maine. Longitudinal displacement resulted in differences due to epistasis between Florida and Alabama populations separated by 300 km but not between Maine and Wisconsin populations separated by 2000 km. Genetic differences between New Jersey and Ontario did not involve either dominance or epistasis and we estimated the minimum number of effective factors contributing to a difference in mean critical photoperiod of 5 SD between them as n(E) = 5. We propose that the genetic similarity of populations within a broad northern region is due to their more recent origin since recession of the Laurentide Ice Sheet and that the unique genetic architecture of each population is the result of both mutation and repeated migration-founder-flush episodes during the dispersal of W. smithii in North America. Our results suggest that differences in composite additive and dominance effects arise early in the genetic divergence of populations while differences due to epistasis accumulate after more prolonged isolation.																	0016-6731	1943-2631				DEC	1997	147	4					1873	1883										WOS:A1997YK65400029	9409843					
J	Kelly, MG; Levin, DA				Kelly, MG; Levin, DA			Fitness consequences and heritability aspects of emergence date in Phlox drummondii	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 The fitness consequences of emergence date in Phlox drummondii were determined for three populations in central Texas (USA). We experimentally manipulated the emergence time of seedlings to extend the distribution of emergents across time. 2 In all years (1989-92) significant differences in fitness were found between populations and between emergence dates. Fitness decreased with later seedling emergence in five of six population-by-year combinations tested. 3 The frequency of juvenile mortality also differed with emergence date in five cases. 4 Later emerging plants flowered sooner than would be expected based on the range of emergence dates, but this was not sufficient to overcome the penalty of late emergence on flower and fruit production. Total flowers per flowering plant always decreased with later emergence, and total fruits and seed-set were negatively correlated with emergence date for two of the three populations. 5 Fitness functions were used to describe the fitness relationship between emergence dates. In all cases individual fitness declined non-linearly at later emergence dates, and in many cases the earliest emergents had the highest expected fitness. The variance in fitness differed among years and sites, and ranged from 0.043 to 0.766 seeds individual(-2). 6 The degree to which days to seedling emergence was heritable in two further native populations of P. drummondii was measured by conducting divergent artificial selection for two generations. The estimates of realized heritability (0.081 and 0.15) could not be distinguished from zero. 7 Phlox drummondii therefore appears to have little genetic capacity to respond to natural or artificial selection on the timing of emergence.																	0022-0477					DEC	1997	85	6					755	766		10.2307/2960599								WOS:000070998600003						
J	Kroon, A; Veenendaal, RL; Veerman, A				Kroon, A; Veenendaal, RL; Veerman, A			Photoperiodic induction of diapause in the spider mite Tetranychus urticae: qualitative or quantitative time measurement?	PHYSIOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												Insects and mites may measure photoperiods either by classifying them as long or short relative to a critical value (qualitative time measurement) or by using the absolute value (quantitative time measurement). The spider mite Tetranychus urticae is thought to use a qualitative mechanism of time measurement. In this paper we present the results of experiments with an inbred line of the spider mite (to keep genetic variation in photoperiodic responses small), to test whether quantitative aspects also play a role. Differences in diapause incidence in different long-night photoperiods at different temperatures may be an indication of quantitative responses to photoperiod. The effect of temperature on the photoperiodic response curve was studied at 16 degrees C, 19 degrees C and 22 degrees C. The response curves appeared to be similar at 16 degrees C and 19 degrees C, with a critical nightlength between 10 and 11 h. At 22 degrees C, diapause induction was less than 100% in all long-night regimens and the critical nightlength had shifted to 12 h. Maximum diapause induction (93%) occurred in a light-dark cycle with a 16 h dark phase (LD 8:16 h). Diapause induction was lowest in long-night photoperiods with dark phases of 20 h and longer. The number of light-dark cycles needed for 50% diapause induction at 19 degrees C varied between 12.1 and 14.7 for LD 6:18 h, between 10.9 and 12.5 for LD 8:16 h, between 10.6 and 11.6 for LD 10:14 h, and between 10.1 and 10.7 for LD 12:12 h. Independent of the light-dark regimen, diapause induction took place in some individuals after receiving 8 cycles and virtually all individuals entered diapause after 16 cycles. No effect was found of the photoperiodic treatment during prediapause development (LD 6:18 h, LD 8:16 h, LD 10:14 h, LD 12:12 h) on diapause duration. The average diapause duration at LD 10:14 h and 19 degrees C was 61 days over all four treatments. We explained the results by hypothesising that nightlengths are assessed qualitatively and that the photoperiodic clock operates more accurately near the critical nightlength.																	0307-6962	1365-3032				DEC	1997	22	4					357	364		10.1111/j.1365-3032.1997.tb01180.x								WOS:000071560800008

The Echinacea and Ilamna species are very close relatives, and the Solidago species are in the same subsection of the genus. Particular attention was given to the Echinacea species. No differences were found in ecological, morphological, physiological, cytological, genetic or life history characteristics per se of E. tennesseensis and E. angustifolia that reasonably could account for differences in their geographical distribution. Thus, a scenario based on historical factors was used in conjunction with the autecology of E. tennesseensis to explain development and maintenance of endemism in this species. Likewise, no difference in species biology was identified in the two fire-dependent, fire-adapted Iliamna species, and thus endemism in I. corei also probably is related to both autecological and historical factors. In contrast to the species pairs in Echinacea and Iliamna, the widespread Solidago altissima has, a greater potential to form a persistent seed bank and is a better competitor than the narrow endemic S. shortii. However, these autecological differences per se should be used with caution in any attempt to explain maintenance of narrow endemism in S. shortii. We conclude that both autecological and historical factors are needed to explain endemism in many plant species.																	0038-4909					DEC	1997	42	4					384	399										WOS:000072506600004

Adult snakes were acclimatized for 5 weeks to a constant temperature of 25 +/- 1 degrees C (range) and an L12:D12 photoperiod; photophase was centered on 1200 hr CST and began at 0600 hr. Temperatures selected by snakes in response to intraperitoneal (IP) injections of saline (control), MEL (5 mg kg(-1) body mass), and CPZ (25 mg kg(-1) body mass), a melatonin antimetabolite, were measured in a linear thermal gradient over a 36-hr experimental period. Using a repeated measures design, we showed that mean preferred body temperature (T-b) of snakes when receiving either MEL (19.6 degrees C, SE = 1.86, n = 11) or CPZ (15.7 degrees C, SE = 1.12, n = 11) differed significantly from the preferred T-b of animals receiving control injections of saline solution (24.1 degrees C, SE = 1.90, n = 11). Changes in metabolic rate were determined with closed system respirometry to measure oxygen consumption before and 3 hr after treatments of: 1) non injected control, 2) injected-saline control, 3) MEL (5 mg kg(-1) body mass), and 4) CPZ (25 mg kg(-1) body mass). Static samples of oxygen consumption before and after treatments showed that MEL and CPZ had no significant effect upon the resting metabolic rate (RMR) 3 hr after injection. A multiple comparisons test of the among-treatment differences indicated that there were no statistically significant changes in RMR (F = 0.975; df = 3,27; P = 0.419). However, the difference between before and after mean RMR for the CPZ experiment was almost significant (W = 35; df 9; P = 0.084), and may be biologically meaningful. Both exogenous and endogenous MEL may play a role in behavioral and physiological thermoregulation of vertebrates and also may influence metabolic rate. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Inc.

J	Sadras, VO; Fitt, GP				Sadras, VO; Fitt, GP			Apical dominance - variability among cotton genotypes and its association with resistance to insect herbivory	ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY												We investigated variability in apical dominance among cotton genotypes (Gassypium hirsutum, G. barbadense) and the relationship between degree of apical dominance and resistance to insect herbivory. Two groups of genotypes were compared: a 'normal' group, including genotypes with naturally occurring concentrations of tannins and terpenoid aldehydes (characteristics of the tribe Gossypiae), and an 'enhanced' group, including experimental lines selected for improved defences. The degree of apical dominance (AD, dimensionless) and the apparent time required for the activation of axillary buds after the removal of the apical bud (t, days) were measured in a glasshouse experiment including 24 genotypes and two damage treatments, i.e damaged plants, in which the apical bud was removed 40 days after sowing, and undisturbed controls. To quantify AD we assumed that the stronger the apical dominance, the greater the distance (d) between the plant apex and the nearest vegetative branch; we measured d and plant height (h) in control plants, and calculated AD = d/h. To calculate t, we counted periodically the leaves in the axillary bud closest to the apex of damaged plants, fitted linear regressions between leaf number and time, and took the x-intercept of the fitted functions as an estimate of t. Between 12 and 19 of the genotypes used in the glasshouse were grown in held experiments involving two treatments: control, protected with insecticides, and unprotected crops exposed to naturally occurring herbivorous insects, including Helicoverpa spp. (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) and sucking mirid bugs (Hemiptera: Miridae). The ratio between the yield of unprotected and protected treatments for each genotype, R, was taken as an empirical measure of herbivory resistance. Degree of apical dominance ranged from 0.35 to 0.80, the height of undamaged plants from 0.68 to 1.0 m, and t from 1 to 7 days. Within the normal group, genotypes with strong apical dominance were taller, and normally had axillary buds that required more time for activation after release of apical dominance. A significant, non-linear relationship between R and AD was found for this group of genotypes, which indicates a broad optimum and a consistent decline in resistance with apical dominance increasing over a threshold (approximate to 0.6). None of these relationships was found for genotypes with 'enhanced' defences, partially because this group had a narrower range of apical dominance. We conclude that a large variability in the degree of apical dominance among cotton genotypes exists that can influence resistance to herbivory, but interactions between degree of apical dominance and defences cannot be disregarded.

J	Lindley, JA				Lindley, JA			Eggs and their incubation as factors in the ecology of planktonic Crustacea	JOURNAL OF CRUSTACEAN BIOLOGY					2nd European Crustacean Conference	SEP 02-06, 1996	LIEGE, BELGIUM					Most crustaceans carry their embryos in a brood chamber or ovisac. However, among the pelagic Crustacea nearly all halocyprid ostracods, most calanoid copepods, euphausiids, and dendrobranchiate decapods (Penaeoidea and Sergestoidea) shed their eggs into the water column. Planktonic Branchiopoda produce resting eggs which remain dormant in the sediment as part of their life cycle. Eggs of calanoids of species within the superfamily Diaptomoidea may also survive dormant in the sediment. The eggs of some Aetideidae adhere to suitable substrates. The freely spawned eggs of other calanoids do not appear to be able to survive in the sediment and their spawning strategies and egg characteristics, and those of Euphausiacea, minimize the risk of their eggs reaching the sea bed. The eggs of free-spawning decapods are buoyant, but demersal development has been suggested for some penaeids. The distributions of brooders are nor directly limited by the egg or incubation characteristics, but those of free spawners may be thus Limited. The production of dormant eggs enables populations to survive when conditions are unfavorable for the pelagic stages, but only in depths in which newly hatched nauplii or juveniles can return to the strata where they can feed to continue development. In contrast, free spawners with nonresistant eggs are at a disadvantage in shallow waters. Free spawning enables populations to reproduce rapidly where food supply is intermittent, particularly in high latitudes.																	0278-0372					NOV	1997	17	4					569	576		10.2307/1549361								WOS:A1997YF43500001						
J	Cross, JV				Cross, JV			Susceptibility of the summer fruit tortrix moth, Adoxophyes orana (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), to chlorpyrifos and strategies for insecticidal control in orchards	ANNALS OF APPLIED BIOLOGY												The susceptibility of populations of the summer fruit tortrix moth, Adoxophyes orana, from apple orchards in Kent, England, to chlorpyrifos was determined in 1992, 1994 and 1995, by topically dosing larvae feeding on leaves or adults adhered to pheromone trap sticky bases. LD50 values (range 6.3 to 23.2 ng chlorpyrifos per individual) for first or second generation males, second generation females or for first generation fourth instar larvae collected in the field were significantly greater (2-3 fold) for populations from orchards with a long history of treatment with broad-spectrum organophosphorus and other insecticides than for those from untreated orchards (range 1.6 to 8.1 ng chlorpyrifos per individual), though there was considerable variation between sites and years. Twelve replicated orchard experiments between 1993 and 1995 were used to examine a range of different strategies for insecticidal control. Applications of chlorpyrifos against overwintered larvae feeding in trusses in spring gave, at best, a 75% reduction in larval numbers, insufficient to prevent damage by the subsequent generation in summer. However, two applications of fenoxycarb (one immediately pre-and one immediately post-blossom of apple cv. Cox) completely prevented successful subsequent development of the pest, and a single (post-blossom) spray nearly so. The timing of application of chlorpyrifos against first generation larvae hatching from eggs in June was shown to be critical and currently used methods of spray-timing were unreliable. The effective persistence of chlorpyrifos was short (<7 days). Though good control could be achieved with a single spray, a better strategy was to apply a series of sprays at 7-day intervals to cover the egg hatch period. Sprays of Bacillus thuringiensis at the same timing intervals gave, maximally, an 80% reduction in larval numbers, but usually less: improved control was not achieved by applying a programme of sprays compared to a single spray, though a novel, more potent, formulation was significantly more active. Triazophos was also effective as an egg hatch spray. Sprays of chlorpyrifos or tebufenozide between late September and mid-October 1995 against second or third instar larvae migrating to overwintering sites before diapause, failed to reduce significantly the numbers of subsequent overwintering larvae or the numbers that emerged to feed on blossom trusses in spring.																	0003-4746	1744-7348				OCT	1997	131	2					197	212		10.1111/j.1744-7348.1997.tb05151.x								WOS:A1997YJ61600003

Immediately after the seed collection from the largest remaining population of the River Tama in early, winter, the seeds showed a low level of relative dormancy, which disappeared within a month under the prevailing conditions in the natural habitat. After a few months' dry chilling storage, the seeds became germinable over a wide temperature range, i.e. 6-36 degrees C. The seeds showed neither requirement for temperature fluctuation nor sensitivity to leaf canopy light. The thermal time required for 50% germination at temperatures below 30 degrees C was less than 70 Kd (Kelvin days calculated with a base temperature of 5 degrees C). Since such requirements for germination of seeds naturally dispersed and overwintered will be satisfied by a spell of spring rain, we cannot expect the formation of persistent soil seed banks. Correspondingly, after spring germination, no or negligible firm intact seeds could be detected in the surface soils sampled. Safe-sites for the recruitment of the species are known to be new areas created by fluvial disturbance, which may occur sporadically in space and time. Without persistent soil seed banks, successful dispersal of the seeds to these safe-sites is of crucial importance for the persistence of the metapopulation composed of ephemeral subpopulations. Recent decrease in the colonization Fate of new subpopulations due to diminishing seed sources might accelerate the decline of the metapopulation. To break the extinction vortex in which the species has been involved, we propose human-aided seed dispersal to safe-sites in order to strengthen the conservation of this threatened species.

J	Shintani, Y; Ishikawa, Y				Shintani, Y; Ishikawa, Y			Diapause avoidance induced by low temperature in the yellow-spotted longicorn beetle, Psacothea hilaris	ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA												The diapause-averting effect of low temperature on pre-diapause larvae was examined in the yellow-spotted longicorn beetle, Psacothea hilaris. Larvae that had been reared under diapause-inducing conditions (25 degrees C, L12:D12) were temporarily exposed to 10 degrees C for various periods, and returned to the initial condition. Diapause was not averted by chilling for 15 days irrespective of the age of the larvae at chilling. After a 30-day chilling treatment, all of the 40- and 60-day-old larvae averted diapause, while diapause was averted in only one-third of the 10- and 20-day-old larvae. None of the pre-diapause larvae chilled for 60 days entered diapause irrespective of the age at chilling. With diapause avoidance, larvae that overwintered in earlier instars can start growing in earliest spring without any arrest; this phenomenon probably subserves the synchronization of larval development in a population.																	0013-8703					OCT	1997	85	1					11	15		10.1046/j.1570-7458.1997.00230.x								WOS:A1997YE33100002						
J	Brown, JL				Brown, JL			Fecal steroid profiles in black-footed ferrets exposed to natural photoperiod	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												We monitored seasonal ovarian and testicular activity in adult, captive black-footed ferrets (Mustela nigripes) using non-invasive fecal steroid metabolite analyses. In females, radioimmunoassay of liquid chromatography-separated fecal extracts revealed that estrogen immunoactivity coincided with unconjugated estradiol-17 beta. whereas progestogen immunoactivity corresponded with a single conjugated and several unconjugated steroid forms, only 8% of which co-eluted with progesterone. In males, androgen immunoactivity was associated with several unconjugated; metabolites, similar to 7% of which co-eluted with testosterone. We collected fecal samples 3 times per week front 5 female and 6 male black-footed ferrets for 18 consecutive months for longitudinal assessment of gonadal activity. Assessment of 7 pregnancies and 9 pseudopregnancies revealed no differences in temporal or quantitative fecal estradiol and progestogen metabolite excretion between these 2 reproductive states. We found elevated concentrations of fecal estradiol were associated with mating activity and an increase in the percentage of superficial cornified epithelial cells in vaginal lavages. Fecal progestogen concentrations increased about 1 week after breeding, peaked at midterm and then declined to baseline at parturition, Males exhibited seasonal fluctuations in fecal androgen excretion with increased concentrations observed similar to 2 months before females entered estrus. Our results indicate that fecal steroid analyses can be used effectively to evaluate gonadal function in the black-footed ferret and might prove valuable for aiding captive breeding strategies to improve species conservation.																	0022-541X					OCT	1997	61	4					1428	1436		10.2307/3802147								WOS:000071737200052

Finally, the amino acid composition of hind leg protein was determined and computed. During intense exercise and recovery, the muscle was a net contributor ofamino acids to the bloodstream, the rates being higher during exercise than in recovery. This efflux was not only due to changes in pool size, but implied the hydrolysis of protein, in the range of 20-25 mu g.min(-1).g(-1) during exercise. Branched chain amino acids were metabolized during exercise, but mainly during recovery. During exercise, there was also an increase in alanine and glutamine pool buildup and efflux. In conclusion the data presented show that protein - and amino acid - metabolism in the exercising muscle are not as dormant as usually accepted, because branched chain amino acids are actively oxidized and the efflux of alanine, glutamine and other amino acids is maintained thanks to the net hydrolysis of protein.

Males transported to both northern sites initiated remex molt later (P = 0.0001) in 1993 than males remaining in Mississippi. In 1994, males continued to molt later at northern sites than in Mississippi, but earlier molting at both northern sites in 1994 than in 1993 resulted in no detectable differences (P = 0.31) in molting date. Although there were no differences (P > 0.05) in date of remex molt between adult and yearling males in 1992 and 1993, molt occurred earlier (P = 0.0006) each year for birds remaining in Mississippi during 1992-1994. Timing of remex molt in male Wood Ducks may be influenced by photoperiodic, environmental, and social cues associated with geographical displacement, but other factors (e.g., genetics) may also influence annual timing.																	0008-4301					SEP	1997	75	9					1545	1548		10.1139/z97-780								WOS:A1997XX04100020

If so? populations on either side of the Rocky Mountains are expected to be divergent because few major flyways cross them. To test this prediction, Daphnia populations from lakes and ponds across eastern Oregon were surveyed for mtDNA and allozyme variation. The data were analysed with previously collected data from populations in the midwest U.S. Phenetic analysis of the allozyme data clustered the populations into four discrete groups, which correspond to habitat: permanent lakes, ponds in the midwest, coastal and valley ponds in Oregon and sand dune ponds in Oregon, A recent taxonomic revision by Hebert suggests that these groups correspond to D. pulicaria, D. pulex, D, arenata and D. melanica. respectively. Cladistic analysis of mtDNA variation revealed the same groups except that mtDNA haplotypes from the D, pulex and D. pulicaria populations formed a single clade. All four species were significantly subdivided with respect to allozyme markers, but there were no clear differences between D. pulicaria populations on either side of the Rocky Mountains, suggesting that they are not a barrier to gene flow in this species, Whereas mtDNA differentiation among D. pulicaria populations was not significant, the pond-dwelling species, D. pulex and D. arenata, showed even greater differentiation for mtDNA than for allozymes. It is suggested that extinction/recolonization events occur more frequently in pond vs, lake habitats and have a greater impact on the subdivision of mtDNA variation because of the haploid, maternal inheritance of the mitochondrial genome.

J	Deviche, P				Deviche, P			Seasonal reproductive pattern of white-winged Crossbills in interior Alaska	JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY												It has been proposed that crossbills (Loxia spp.) are opportunistic breeders that time the onset of their reproductive cycle based on food availability rather than photoperiod, as is the case in most other bird species. Crossbills are able to nest throughout most of the year at middle latitudes, but the reproductive biology of these birds at high latitudes remains poorly known. A total of 469 White-winged Crossbills (Loxia leucoptera) was caught in Fairbanks, Alaska during a 2.5-yr period. Based on the proportion of juvenile birds in the sampled population, the proportion of adult females with a brood patch, and seasonal changes in adult male cloacal protuberance size, it appears that interior Alaska White-winged Crossbills breed only in spring and early summer. Timing of reproduction of crossbills breeding at high latitudes may be limited by environmental factors (potentially, ambient temperature and/or photoperiod) rather than by food availability.																	0273-8570					FAL	1997	68	4					613	621										WOS:A1997YF31400014						
J	Griffith, GS; Cook, R; Mizen, KA				Griffith, GS; Cook, R; Mizen, KA			Ditylenchus dipsaci infestation of Trifolium repens .2. Dynamics of infestation development	JOURNAL OF NEMATOLOGY												Trifolium repens (white clover) stolons were inoculated with Ditylenchus dipsaci (stem nematode), and the development of resulting infestations was monitored. Nematodes initially remained confined to superficial locations, concentrating in petiole axils near inoculation points. They were able to migrate slowly from the initial inoculation points and infest adjacent axils, especially in regions near the stolen tip. As time progressed, in some axils, nematodes migrated through the stolen epidermis and colonized slowly expanding subepidermal pockets of host tissue (ca, 0.2-mm length of stolon/day). In these loci nematodes established exponentially increasing populations, but the rates of locus expansion remained constant, indicating that locus expansion was limited by unidentified host-dependent factors. As a result of increasing population pressure within subepidermal loci, J4 entered a ''diapause'' state and the rate of egg production by adults declined, thereby reducing rate of population growth to more sustainable levels. Typically, these populations peaked at ca. 10,000 individuals in ca. 160 days occupying S-cm lengths of stolen. Thereafter, heavily infested regions of stolons started to die, leading to the formation of longitudinal splits in their epidermis. In other axils, nematodes did not migrate into the stolons but remained confined to axils. Some of these populations increased a hundred-fold in 95 days, with population growth ending when petioles started to die. Host plant stolen morphology was affected only when subepidermal stolen populations developed high population levels (>100 nematodes) within close proximity (<2 cm) to active terminal meristems. This occurred either when axillary buds became active on previously infested nodes or when nematodes established endoparasitic populations at locations near the stolen tip during winter and spring, when the rate of stolen extension was limited by low light intensity. Affected stolen tips could ''escape'' from the influence of such infestations when light intensity and temperature increased. Nematode activity was limited by low temperature rather than light intensity. Global warming is likely to lead to greater damage to infested plants during the winter and early spring because the predicted milder winter temperatures will enhance nematode activity but not necessarily promote stolen growth.																	0022-300X					SEP	1997	29	3					356	369										WOS:A1997YF53400015	19274169					
J	Randolph, SE; Rogers, DJ				Randolph, SE; Rogers, DJ			A generic population model for the African tick Rhipicephalus appendiculatus	PARASITOLOGY												We present a simulation population model for the African tick Rhipicephalus appendiculatus, based on previous analyses of the mortality factors most closely correlated with observed population changes at 11 sites in equatorial and South Africa. The model incorporates temperature-dependent rates of egg production and development, climate-driven density-independent mortality rates, particularly during the adult-larval stage, and density-dependent regulation of both nymphs and adults. Diapause is also included for tick populations in southern Africa. The model successfully describes both the seasonality and annual range of variation in numbers of each tick stage observed at each of 4 test sites in Uganda, Burundi and South Africa. Sensitivity analysis showed that the final version of the model is robust to 4-fold variation in most parameter values (that were per force based on informed guesses), but is more sensitive to the regression coefficients determining density-dependent interstadial mortality (that were derived from analysis of field data). The model is able to predict the seasonality of ticks from a site in Kenya where a full prior population analysis was not possible because only adults and nymphs had been counted. The model is potentially applicable to other species of ticks, both tropical and temperate, to predict tick abundance and seasonality as risk factors for tick-borne diseases.																	0031-1820					SEP	1997	115		3				265	279		10.1017/S0031182097001315								WOS:A1997XW95900006	9300464					
J	Takeda, M; Nagata, T				Takeda, M; Nagata, T			Effects of photoperiod and age of rice plant on larval development in two geographic ecotypes of Chlorops oryzae MATSUMURA (Diptera: Chloropidae)	APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY												When larvae of the Akita strain (bivoltine, 39 degrees N) of Chlorops oryzae MATSUMURA were reared on rice-plant seedlings younger than the 4 leaf stage under LD12: 12 or 14: 10, most pupated 25 days after hatching. Under long day conditions (LD15:9), by contrast; most larvae failed to pupate and remained in the first or second larval stage 25 days after hatching when reared on 7-leaf-stage seedlings. On the other hand, larvae of the Aichi strain (trivoltine, 35 degrees N) reared on rice seedlings of the 5 leaf stage or younger grew fast under both short and long days. Larval development was delayed under an intermediate day (LD 14: 10). This suppression of larval development in the Aichi strain became more marked as the rice plants aged. These results suggest that larval development in the first generation of the bivoltine strain and the second generation of the trivoltine strain is retarded by photoperiodic and host-plant conditions. This retarded development in the early larval stage may be regarded as diapause mediated by food plant and photoperiod.																	0003-6862					AUG	1997	32	3					453	458		10.1303/aez.32.453								WOS:A1997XV72700005						
J	Fujiyama, S				Fujiyama, S			Life cycle of Anomala cuprea Hope (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) in field experiments on adaptation to different thermal environments.	JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY												To analyze acclimation in Anomala cuprea to different thermal environments, populations from Sakurai (135 degrees 50'E; 34 degrees 30'N; alt. 50 m), Nara Prefecture, Japan were reared at four altitudes on Mt. Hiei (135 degrees 50'E; 35 degrees 3'N; alt. 848 m; Kyoto Prefecture): 120 m; 300 m, 580 m and 820 m. Results were compared with development estimates made using thermal constant and developmental zero, and estimated soil temperature. The seasonal developments of the populations corresponded well with the estimates. Populations that hibernated at the third instar in the first year had a univoltine life cycle, but those that hibernated at younger stages had a semivoltine life cycle regardless of altitude. It seems that the populations could be acclimated up to an altitude of 580 m but not at 820 m, because adult emergence was too late for reproduction. It is concluded that natural populations occurring above altitudes of 580 m and latitudes above 38 degrees N must have a different temperature response presenting diapause, or thermal constant and/or developmental zero. The polymorphic variation in life cycle and the quite wide distribution of scarabaeids is discussed based on the significance of mild soil temperature in winter.																	0021-4914					AUG	1997	41	3					121	131										WOS:A1997XV71100002						
J	McWatters, HG; Saunders, DS				McWatters, HG; Saunders, DS			Inheritance of the photoperiodic response controlling larval diapause in the blow fly, Calliphora vicina	JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY												Larvae of the blow fly Calliphora vicina R-D. (Diptera: Calliphoridae) display a diapause in response to the exposure of their parents to short photoperiods. Due to geographic variation in photoperiodic response, flies from a southern, English population show a long-day response to the fixed photoperiod of L:D 15.5:8.5 whilst flies from a northern population from Finland show a short-day response to the same photoperiod. Crosses between these strains have shown previously that diapause incidence is a maternal characteristic; here we demonstrate that the hybrid female offspring of such crosses are not intermediate between the two parental strains but show a photoperiodic response biased towards their maternal line. Thus not only are males unable to influence directly the diapause incidence among their offspring but the indirect effects of inheritance down the male line are weaker than down the female. Diapause duration, in contrast, is influenced by each parent in a similar manner. Diapause lasts longer in larvae with a greater admixture of northern genes regardless of whether they were maternal or paternal.

J	Kostal, V; Hodek, I				Kostal, V; Hodek, I			Photoperiodism and control of summer diapause in the Mediterranean tiger moth Cymbalophora pudica	JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY												Photoperiodic responses to both constant and changing photoperiods were studied in the Mediterranean tiger moth Cymbalophora pudica. Embryos, larval instars and prepupae were all sensitive to photoperiod, and the responses of larvae and prepupae to changing photoperiods were similar. At 23 +/- 2 degrees C, constant 24-h photoperiods with short photophases (11, 12h) induced a long diapause (mean 88 days) whereas long photophases (14, 16h) induced a short diapause (mean 52 days). A change to a longer or shorter photophase during larval development or during diapause caused a significant extension (up to a maximum of 138 days) or shortening (down to a minimum of 10 days) of diapause, respectively, but only when at least one of the photophases was longer than 14h. Thus, shortening and prolongation of photophase had an opposite effect than constant short land long photophases, respectively. Changes within the range of photophases of 10-14h did not cause a significant change in diapause duration. Experimental results enabled us to outline the mechanisms regulating voltinism and the duration of summer diapause. For the monovoltine cycle, cold autumn/winter temperatures slow down larval development, and prepupal aestivation starts relatively late (March, April). Prepupae are then kept in diapause by the increasing daylength (>14h after late April). Pupation is synchronized by decreasing daylength after summer solstice, and imagoes emerge in September/October. For the bivoltine cycle, when the autumn/winter temperatures are relatively warm, a certain portion of the population (depending on the individual rate of growth) may be diverted to a bivoltine life-cycle. In such a case, larval development is fast and short enough to allow an early start of diapause (prior to or during February). The duration of such early diapause is not influenced by changes in daylength (< 14h); pupation occurs very early (April/May), and spring generation imagoes fly and oviposit in May/June. Summer larvae and prepupae live under decreasing daylength (>14h), which shortens their diapause to 20-30 days. Imagoes of the autumnal generation thus occur in September/October, together with the univoltine portion of the population. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Jackson, JJ				Jackson, JJ			Biology of Aphthona nigriscutis (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) in the laboratory	ANNALS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												The flea beetle Aphthona nigriscutis Foudras was introduced to Canada in 1983 and the United States in 1989 for the biological control of leafy spurge, Euphorbia esula L. Life history data for A. nigriscutis are described based on laboratory studies using insect populations from Barnes County, North Dakota, and Fallen County, Montana. Initial emergence of males and females from spring soil samples was synchronized, but complete emergence for males preceded that of females. For the Barnes County population, approximate to 80% of the adults were female. When adults were held as mated pairs at 25 degrees C and a photoperiod of 14: 10 (L:D) h, male longevity was longer than that of the female with a median longevity of 221 and 124 d, respectively. Oviposition started approximate to 10 d after female emergence and proceeded at a rate of 4 eggs per day over an average oviposition period of 109 d. Oviposition averaged 537 eggs per female with a range of 103-1,157. Eggs from the Fallen County population started to hatch within 10 d after oviposition when eggs were held at 25 degrees C. Egg hatch averaged near 60% and occurred over a period of approximate to 8 d. Life history data for A. nigriscutis were similar to other univoltine Aphthona spp., except A. nigriscutis had a female-biased sex ratio, greater male longevity, and higher female oviposition.																	0013-8746					JUL	1997	90	4					433	437		10.1093/aesa/90.4.433								WOS:A1997XP58100004

The species of storage beetles used were Trogoderma granarium Everts, Oryzaephilus surinamensis (L.), Cryptolestes ferrugineus (Stephens), Rhyzopertha dominica (Fabricius), and Sitophilus granarius (L.). At 40 degrees C, only small numbers of T. granarium larvae developed but at 35 degrees C, this species produced very large populations of larvae. At 30 degrees C, O. surinamensis, R. dominica and S. granarius increased moderately while at 25 degrees C the small numbers of O. surinamensis detected were eclipsed by the very large increases in S. granarius which also increased vigorously at 20 degrees C. No adult insects survived in any experiment after four months at 5 degrees C. These results indicate that the best strategy to break dormancy and discourage infestation would be to break dormancy at just above 40 degrees C, followed by rapid cooling.																	0046-9750					JUL-AUG	1997	103	4					245	249		10.1002/j.2050-0416.1997.tb00952.x								WOS:A1997XN10300004						
J	Gomi, T				Gomi, T			Geographic variation in critical photoperiod for diapause induction and its temperature dependence in Hyphantria cunea Drury (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae)	OECOLOGIA												The fall webworm, Hyphantria cunea Drury (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae), was introduced from North America to Japan half a century ago. The critical photoperiod for diapause induction and its temperature dependence, as defined by the difference in the critical photoperiod between 20 and 25 degrees C, were investigated in order to understand the mechanisms behind a shift from bi- to trivoltine life cycles. The critical photoperiod for diapause induction was shorter in the southern trivoltine populations than in the northern bivoltine populations, and this was more marked at 25 degrees C than at 20 degrees C. Although the critical photoperiod showed a positive correlation with the original latitude, the correlation was relatively low at both temperatures. Conversely, temperature dependence of the critical photoperiod for diapause induction correlated negatively with the original latitude. The trivoltine populations showed,greater temperature sensitivity than the bivoltine populations. These results suggest that an increase in temperature sensitivity of the diapause response to photoperiods was involved in the shift to a trivoltine life cycle. The crossing experiments suggested that the photoperiodic control of diapause induction and its temperature dependence are under polygenic control without sex-linkage.																	0029-8549					JUL	1997	111	2					160	165		10.1007/s004420050220								WOS:A1997XK99200002	28307989					
J	Day, KR				Day, KR			The influence of temperature on egg mortality in the budmoth Zeiraphera diniana (Lepidoptera:Tortricidae), and its role in determining the regional abundance of an important forest pest	BULLETIN OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH												The range of the moth Zeiraphera diniana Guenee and the regions where high population densities are infrequent and unpredictable are thought to be determined by high temperatures during egg pre-diapause. Exposure of eggs to incubation temperatures known to be optimal for Z. diniana elsewhere resulted in a pre-diapause mortality of 13% which corresponds to known rates of egg mortality in British forests. Evidence suggests that high temperature and its duration are both important determinants of pre-diapause egg mortality which, if experienced in forest conditions, may prevent populations from reaching outbreak levels. Historical records of outbreaks were associated with lower than average August temperature. However, high temperatures on their own are unlikely to determine the range of the insect in Britain since a high proportion of eggs survives extremes; more than 70% of British eggs survived 24 h exposure to a temperature of 30 degrees C. Variations in egg mortality among families of moths suggests a genetic basis for differences in thermal tolerance. Furthermore, there may be selection for thermally-tolerant eggs in British forest environments and this could be connected with other forms of genetic differentiation in budmoth populations.																	0007-4853					JUN	1997	87	3					259	264		10.1017/S0007485300037202								WOS:A1997XC68300005

Changes in fresh weight (FW), dry weight (DW), ash-free dry weight (AFDW), water, carbon (C), nitrogen (N), total lipids, proteins, carbohydrates, and respiration rates were measured in developing eggs. The percentage of water increased from 52% to 87% of FW, most rapidly after the beginning of organ differentiation and during hatching. The accumulation of minerals followed a similar pattern, with ash increasing from 3% to 7% of DW in the eggs, and to 26% at hatching. Inverse (decreasing) patterns were observed in organic matter (AFDW, C, N, lipids, proteins). During development from the undivided egg to the freshly hatched zoea larva, 69% of the initial lipid and 35% of protein were depleted. Carbohydrates represented a minor constituent of yolk (1% to 2% of DW). In spite of a decreasing protein content, N remained almost constant. This suggests a final increase in low-molecular nitrogenous substances, which are not quantitatively detected by the Lowry method (probably free amino acids); we suspect that these may play a role in the hatching process. In the gastrula, and from about 3 months after the onset of organ differentiation until 1 or 2 months before hatching, low embryonic respiration rates as well as microscopical observations indicated the existence of developmental resting periods. Such diapause-like intervals may coordinate the time of hatching with a short season of planktonic food production in high latitudes. The relative importance of lipids and proteins as fuel for embryogenesis is compared with that in other crustacean taxa.

J	Johansen, NS				Johansen, NS			Mortality of eggs, larvae and pupae and larval dispersal of the cabbage moth, Mamestra brassicae, in white cabbage in south-eastern Norway	ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA												The mortality of eggs, larvae and pupae and larval dispersal of the cabbage moth, Mamestra brassicae (L.) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) was investigated in a series of small-scale field experiments in white cabbage, Brassicae oleracea var. capitata (L.), and in the laboratory during 1990-1992 in south-eastern Norway. The highest mortality was found in young larvae and in hibernating pupae. In 1990, larval mortality in the first instar was 80% (range 9-97% for the individual cohorts). Most larvae died within the first 1-3 days after hatching. The dispersal activity during these days was high, and failure to establish feeding sites and predation were probably the main mortality causes. Pupal mortality during winter was 90% on average for 1990-1993 (range 81-100%). The main mortality factor was probably unfavourable weather conditions, and indications of cold stress were found. The impact from parasitoids and diseases was generally low. Trichogrammma semblidis (Aurivillius) (Trichogrammatidae) was reared from M. brassicae eggs in very low numbers in 1991. Larval parasitism increased from < 1% in 1990 to almost 24% in 1992, and was almost totally caused by the braconids Microplitis mediator (Haliday) and Aleiodes (Aleiodes) sp. Predation of frozen larvae on the soil surface was 75% on average (range 63-96%) during 1990-1992 in first instar larvae and decreased gradually with larval age. The consumption rates of Philonthus atratus (Gravenhorst) (Staphylinidae) and the carabids Bembidion tetracolum (Say), Pterostichus melanarius (Illiger) and Harpalus rufipes (Degeer) on M. brassicae eggs and larvae were investigated in non-choice experiments in the laboratory. A preliminary survival model based on estimates of the mortality factors identified in this study is presented.																	0013-8703					JUN	1997	83	3					347	360		10.1046/j.1570-7458.1997.00190.x								WOS:A1997XL26700013

They occasionally co-exist on deciduous fruit trees at the intermediate latitudes, but their occurrences are unstable and P. mori is often excluded. Interspecific matings between the two species interfere with a subsequent effective intraspecific mating, to a greater extent far P. mori than for P. citri. Panonychus mori males show a strong preference for conspecific females, whereas P. citri males do not show any mating preference. This suggests that under the co-existence of the two species the deleterious effect through reproductive interference is more intense for P. mori than for P. citri. On peach trees where the two species co-exist with various density ratios, the proportion of ineffective females (females that did not produce any female offspring) was higher in P. mori than in P. citri and the proportion increased with increasing density of the other species relative to that of its own species. A simple differential equation model incorporating the above reproductive interference demonstrated that the stable co-existence of the two species is unlikely and that P. citri will have a much higher chance of excluding P. mori, due to a greater reproductive interference effect and higher reproductive rate than the latter. However, the outcome of competition depends on the initial density ratios, which will be influenced by various stochastic events, thereby reducing the probability of one-sided exclusion over a wider area.																	0168-8162					JUN-JUL	1997	21	6-7					379	391		10.1023/A:1018423711166								WOS:A1997XN15100006						
J	Molenaar, FJ; Breeman, AM				Molenaar, FJ; Breeman, AM			Latitudinal trends in the growth and reproductive seasonality of Delesseria sanguinea, Membranoptera alata, and Phycodrys rubens (Rhodophyta)	JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												The seasonality of Delesseria sanguinea, Membranoptera alata, and Phycodrys rubens (Rhodophyta) was studied at Helgoland (North Sea, Germany) and Roscoff (Brittany, France). Plants were collected at bimonthly intervals, and growth and reproduction were monitored. Growth of blades was observed mainly in spring, although small blades were found on plants of M. alata and P. rubens all year round. In summer, plants started to degenerate and in autumn they became fertile. The reproductive season of D. sanguinea lasted from October to February/April at both locations, whereas reproductive plants of M. alata and P. rubens were found until April at Helgoland and until June and August, respectively, in Roscoff. Lower winter temperatures at Helgoland than at Roscoff may have caused these differences in the duration of the reproductive season. Using published data, the seasonal patterns at Helgoland and Roscoff were compared to those found at other locations (e.g. Barents Sea; Maine, USA; Isle of Man, UK) and local temperature/daylength conditions. Blade growth was synchronized across all populations and occurred in spring when temperatures were usually still suboptimal for growth. Maximum reproduction was generally found in the colder half of the year but started earlier in autumn in the Barents Sea. Adaptive strategies in the seasonal control of growth and reproduction are discussed. Adequate timing of the history events (e.g. appearance of juveniles in spring) appears more important than maximal growth and reproduction of adults during the season with the most favorable temperatures.																	0022-3646					JUN	1997	33	3					330	343		10.1111/j.0022-3646.1997.00330.x								WOS:A1997XH98800002						
J	Shintani, Y; Ishikawa, Y				Shintani, Y; Ishikawa, Y			Temperature dependency of photoperiodic response and its geographic variation in the yellow-spotted longicorn beetle, Psacothea hilaris (Pascoe) (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae)	APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY												Photoperiodic response of larval development in the yellow-spotted longicorn beetle, Psacothea hilaris (PASCOE), was examined at 20 and 30 degrees C using six geographic populations collected in Japan (Akita, Oyama, Ayabe, Ino, Naze and Ishigaki). The results were compared with the responses at 25 degrees C that have been already examined (Appl. Entomol. Zool. 31: 495-504). At 30 degrees C, larvae of the six populations responded to the photoperiod in the same way as observed at 25 degrees C. By contrast, photoperiodic response at 20 degrees C was largely different from that at higher temperatures. In the Ayabe and Ino populations, which showed clear long-day responses at higher temperatures, supernumerary molting (a characteristic of larval diapause in this species) was induced under both 12L: 12D and 15L: 9D. Larvae of the Naze population also showed less clear long-day photoperiodic response. Most noticeably, larvae of the Akita, Oyama and Ishigaki populations, which did not show clear photoperiodic response at higher temperatures, expressed typical long-day responses at 20 degrees C.																	0003-6862					MAY	1997	32	2					347	354		10.1303/aez.32.347								WOS:A1997XB77000010

The parameters were monitored at 18, 20 and 25 degrees C: 16L8D, at which diapause was not induced. Large variations were demonstrated among populations in the temperature effect on total oviposition and age-specific oviposition pattern. In the Aomori and Kyoto populations, which had high and intermediate diapause capacity, respectively, temperature affected total oviposition, and females laid significantly fewer eggs at 18 and 20 degrees C than a 25 degrees C in the Aomori population, and fewer at 18 degrees C than at 20 and 25 degrees C in the Kyoto population. On the other hand, in the Naha population which had a very weak diapause capacity, temperature did not affect the total oviposition. These results showed that the lower the capacity for diapause, the wider is the temperature range at which full reproduction is achieved.																	0003-6862					MAY	1997	32	2					395	401		10.1303/aez.32.395								WOS:A1997XB77000016						
J	Stack, PA; Drummond, FA				Stack, PA; Drummond, FA			Reproduction and development of Orius insidiosus in a blue light-supplemented short photoperiod	BIOLOGICAL CONTROL												An important limitation in using the insidious flower bug, Orius insidiosus (Say) (Hemiptera:Anthocoridae), as a biological control agent in north temperate winter greenhouse crop production is its tendency to enter reproductive diapause during short photoperiods. Laboratory experiments assessed the effect of a blue light-supplemented short photoperiod over a range of temperature regimes on female reproductive diapause induction, nymph development and survival, ovarian maturation period, and oviposition of O. insidiosus. In experiment one, all O. insidiosus Life stages were exposed to a broad-spectrum photoperiod of 15:9 (L:D) h, a blue light-supplemented photoperiod of 9:15 (L:D) h, consisting of 9 h broad-spectrum light followed by 6 h blue light, or a broad-spectrum photoperiod of 9:15 (L:D) h, all at 24 +/- 1 degrees C. Approximately 75% of mated females reproduced in the broad-spectrum long photoperiod and the blue light-supplemented short photoperiod regimes, whereas over 50% of the bugs diapaused in the broad-spectrum short photoperiod regime. There was no difference among the light treatments for all other measured responses. In experiment two, all O. insidiosus life stages were exposed to the blue light-supplemented short photoperiod over a range of temperature regimes (19-28 degrees C). At least 90% of mated females reproduced at each temperature. A linear relationship occurred for temperature and nymph development and for temperature and ovarian maturation period. The oviposition rate was similar at 22 degrees, 25 degrees, and 28 degrees C. This study indicates the potential for using supplemental blue light to enhance O. insidiosus reproduction in a short photoperiod and may be important as a biological control strategy in winter greenhouse production systems.

J	Shields, FD; Knight, SS; Cooper, CM				Shields, FD; Knight, SS; Cooper, CM			Rehabilitation of warmwater stream ecosystems following channel incision	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Presented is a case study of two streams (watershed size, 12 and 14 km(2)) damaged by channel straightening and incision. One stream was stabilized using a metal sheet piling weir and dormant willow post planting, while the other was treated with a stone weir, stone toe bank protection and willow sprout planting. Fishes and their physical habitats were monitored for 1-2 years before construction and two to three years afterward. Willow planting was not successful, so canopy, bank vegetation, and woody debris density were unchanged. Pool habitat area increased from less than 5% to more than 30% of the total aquatic area. Fish species richness and diversity were unchanged, but species composition shifted away from patterns typical of shallow, sandy runs toward Fool-dwelling types, becoming more similar to a nearby lightly-degraded reference site. Median lengths of selected centrarchids increased following rehabilitation. Physical and biological response were more persistent for the stream treated with the stone weir and bank toe protection, possibly because the stone toe produced a more uniform longitudinal distribution of cover and pool habitats than the single weir.

ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												This study focuses on the seasonal occurrence of a univoltine butterfly, Minois dryas Scopoli, in Kyoto (warm temperate zone) and Hokkaido (subfrigid zone). Adult females were collected periodically and their ovarian stage was determined. In Kyoto, females emerging in early July entered reproductive diapause and did not oviposit until mid-August. In females from Hokkaido, however, ovaries developed promptly after emergence in mid-and late July, and there was no sign of diapause. Males emerged earlier than females, did not enter diapause, and mated soon after females emerged in both Kyoto and hokkaido. The environmental factors that maintain summer diapause in females are not clear; females oviposited soon after transfer to long-day or short-day conditions not only in the laboratory but also when reared under natural photoperiod and temperature.

J	Stiefel, VL; Nechols, JR; Margolies, DC				Stiefel, VL; Nechols, JR; Margolies, DC			Development and survival of Anomoea flavokansiensis (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) as affected by temperature.	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												Development and survival of the leaf beetle Anomoea flavokansiensis Moldenke varied when immature stages were reared under constant temperatures of 21, 25, 29, 33, and 37 degrees C. Embryogenesis and hatching occurred at all temperatures except 37 degrees. At 21 degrees C, 15% of the eggs hatched, but none survived through the 1st instar. Development to adults occurred at 25, 29, and 33 degrees C, but survivorship was highly variable. Approximately 55-60% of the immatures survived to adulthood at 25 and 29 degrees C, whereas only approximate to 10% emerged as adults at 33 degrees C. Adult beetles reared at 33 degrees C were significantly smaller than those reared at 25 and 29 degrees C or adults found in nature. The rate of development was slow at all temperatures; the average times to adulthood were 235.8 d at 25 degrees C and 197.1 d at 29 degrees C remained developmentally inactive as 5th instars for up to 6 mo before pupating. The time required for progeny from different mothers to reach the adult stage at 29 degrees C was highly variable within families but no significantly different among families, suggesting that maternal lineage is not an important source of variation in the development schedules of siblings. A flavokansiensis larvae appear to have an unusually high developmental threshold, can complete development only within a narrow range of temperatures, and have a life cycle that may involve extended larval dormancy in part of the population.																	0046-225X					APR	1997	26	2					223	228		10.1093/ee/26.2.223								WOS:A1997WZ11800011						
J	Armbruster, P; Bradshaw, WE; Holzapfel, CM				Armbruster, P; Bradshaw, WE; Holzapfel, CM			Evolution of the genetic architecture underlying fitness in the pitcher-plant mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii	EVOLUTION												We examined the genetic basis for evolutionary divergence among geographic populations of the pitcher-plant mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii, using protein electrophoresis and line-cross analysis. Line-cross experiments were performed under both low density, near-optimal conditions, and at high, limiting larval densities sufficient to reduce fitness (r(c)) in parental populations by approximately 50%. We found high levels of electrophoretic divergence between ancestral and derived populations, but low levels of divergence between two ancestral populations and between two derived populations. Assessed under near-optimal conditions, the genetic divergence of fitness (r(c)) between ancestral and derived populations, but not between two derived populations or between two ancestral populations, has involved both allelic (dominance) and genic (epistatic) interactions. The role of dominance and epistasis in the divergence of r(c) among populations affects its component traits in a pattern that is unique to each cross. Patterns of genetic differentiation among populations of W. smithii provide evidence for a topographically complex ''adaptive landscape'' as envisioned by Wright in his ''shifting balance'' theory of evolution. Although we cannot definitively rule out the role of deterministic evolution in the divergence of populations on this landscape, ecological inference and genetic data are more consistent with a stochastic than a deterministic process. At high, limiting larval density, hybrid vigor is enhanced and the influence of epistasis disappears. Thus, under stressful conditions, the advantages to fitness due to hybrid heterozygosity can outweigh the deleterious effects of fragmented gene complexes. These results have important implications for the management of inbred populations. Outbreeding depression assessed in experimental crosses under benign lab, zoo, or farm conditions may not accurately reveal the increased advantages of heterozygosity in suboptimal or marginal conditions likely to be found in nature.																	0014-3820					APR	1997	51	2					451	458		10.2307/2411117								WOS:A1997WX72200013	28565340

The body mass and water content of adult beetles kept in sand at 4 degrees C varied over a 16-week period of diapause according to the substratum's moisture content. Changes in body water content, in turn, influenced the crystallization temperature (range -3.3 to -18.4 degrees C; n = 417), indicating that environmental moisture indirectly determined supercooling capacity, a measure of physiological cold hardiness. Beetles held in dry sand readily tolerated a 24-h exposure to temperatures ranging from 0 degrees to -5 degrees C, but those chilled in sand containing as little as 1.7% water (dry mass) had elevated mortality. Thus burrowing in dry soils not only promotes supercooling via its effect on water balance, but may also inhibit inoculative freezing. Mortality of beetles exposed to -5 degrees C for 24 h was lower in substrates composed of sand, clay and/or peat (36-52%) than in pure silica sand (78%) having an identical water content (17.0% dry mass). In addition to moisture, the texture, structure, water potential, and other physico-chemical attributes of soil may strongly influence the cold hardiness and overwintering survival of burrowing insects.																	0174-1578					APR	1997	167	3					169	176		10.1007/s003600050061								WOS:A1997XD06000002						
J	Kennaway, DJ; Rowe, SA				Kennaway, DJ; Rowe, SA			Controlled-release melatonin implants delay puberty in rats without altering melatonin rhythmicity	JOURNAL OF PINEAL RESEARCH												There is increasing evidence that continuous availability of melatonin via implants can produce the same physiological changes in animals as timed administration of the hormone. The mechanisms underlying this apparent contradiction are not known. In an attempt to gain further understanding of the way continuous melatonin administration affects reproductive activity, the effects of melatonin implants on gonadal development and melatonin production were investigated in rats treated neonatally with testosterone. Five-day-old male rats maintained on a 12L:12D photoperiod were injected with 1 mg testosterone propionate to induce photo-responsiveness and implanted at 21 days of age with novel melatonin implants designed to raise the daytime blood melatonin concentration into the nighttime range, i.e., from less than 60 pM in the controls during the day to 380 +/- 33 pM in the implanted rats. Following 21 days treatment, seminal vesicle and ventral prostate weights of implanted rats were significantly less than the controls (27.0 +/- 1.9 vs. 18.5 +/- 1.5 mg/100g BW (P = 0.003) and 33.8 +/- 2.1 vs. 26.7 +/- 2.2 mg/100g BW (P = 0.02), respectively). To determine the effect of the implants upon melatonin production, urine was collected at hourly intervals during the last four days of the experiment and the hourly 6-sulphatoxymelatonin (aMT.6S) excretion rate was determined. Rats bearing melatonin implants maintained a rhythm of aMT.6S excretion in 12L:12D, which was indistinguishable from that in the control animals except for a raised daytime excretion of the metabolite. Following one cycle of urinary aMT.6S measurements in the light/dark cycle, the animals were released into constant darkness, with the implants still in place or after their removal four hours before darkness to evaluate the characteristics of the melatonin rhythm in the absence of masking effects of the light/dark cycle. The melatonin rhythm persisted in both control and implanted rats and no differences in the onset, offset, or amplitude could be determined. The results of this study indicate that, like many other mammals, for laboratory rats controlled continuous release of melatonin can mimic the effects of short daylength or timed melatonin administration. Despite the reproductive consequences of continuous melatonin delivery, the timing of endogenous melatonin production is unaffected.

J	Schutz, W; Milberg, P				Schutz, W; Milberg, P			Seed dormancy in Carex canescens: Regional differences and ecological consequences	OIKOS												We compared the germination of seeds of Carex canescens from populations in four regions: northern and southern Sweden, and northern and southern Germany. Germination behaviour was expected to differ between regions owing to adaptations to the local climates. We compared three or four populations from each region in 31 germination experiments (different pre-treatments, different temperature regimes, light vs darkness). In a parallel experiment, we recorded seedling emergence under outdoor conditions from seeds sown in the late summer in northern Germany. Although there were differences in the level of dormancy between the 13 populations and four regions, we were unable to detect geographic patterns which could be explained in terms of differential adaptation to the local climates. Our data did not support a proposed hypothesis that populations experiencing more severe winter conditions would require a longer cold-stratification period. We compared the results from the outdoor experiment with germination data from the laboratory experiments. The latter could not be used to predict differences in the timing of seedling emergence, the time-span during which seedlings emerged, or the number of seedlings emerging. We conclude that the relevance of detected differences in dormancy level among species or populations must be interpreted with great care. First, the detection of geographical patterns requires extensive sampling, second, the ecological consequences of such differences should be established.

When subjected to a seawater challenge test (34 parts/thousand at 4-5 degrees C), charr on their way to the sea showed only minor and temporary changes in blood plasma osmolality and Na+ and Mg2+ concentrations. The seawater tests also revealed good hypoosmoregulatory capacity for Arctic charr returning from the marine environment 4 wk later. A progressive decrease in seawater tolerance was first documented 7-11 days after their return to the freshwater habitat. Thus the Svalbard charr, being the northernmost anadromous salmonid and probably a direct descendant from the first Salvelinus immigrants to freshwater systems, undergoes a preparatory increase of hypoosmoregulatory capacity (smoltification) before entering the oceanic water bodies. Furthermore, the termination of their short annual seawater stay is probably elicited by factors controlling body systems other than osmoregulation.																	0363-6119					MAR	1997	272	3					R743	R749										WOS:A1997WP36000002	9087635					
J	BenDavid, M				BenDavid, M			Timing of reproduction in wild mink: The influence of spawning Pacific salmon	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE												In many species of seasonally breeding mammals, reproduction occurs later at higher latitudes. Records of timing of reproduction in free-ranging American mink (Mustela vison) in North America and Europe suggest a similar trend. Observations on mink in southeast Alaska, however, revealed a deviation from this pattern, suggesting that factors other than latitude and associated day length may affect timing of breeding for this species in this area. I investigated timing of reproduction and body condition of wild, free-ranging mink on Chichagof Island, southeast Alaska, and hypothesized that seasonal food availability, especially abundant carcasses of spawning Pacific salmon (Onchorhynchus sp.), would determine timing of breeding in this population of mink. Blood progesterone levels, body condition, and testicle lengths were recorded for 24 adult mink, livetrapped from mid-March to late July in 1992 and 1993. Results suggest that these free-ranging mink mate during the later part of April to early May, and parturition occurs in late June to early July. Although male mink seemed to respond to photoperiodism in initiating reproduction, timing of reproduction in female mink was shifted so that lactation coincided with the availability of carcasses of Pacific salmon.																	0008-4301					MAR	1997	75	3					376	382		10.1139/z97-047								WOS:A1997XB77600004						
J	Bradford, MJ; Roff, DA				Bradford, MJ; Roff, DA			An empirical model of diapause strategies of the cricket Allonemobius socius	ECOLOGY												We modeled the effect of heterogeneity in growing-season length on the diapause strategies of a partially bivoltine population of the striped ground cricket Allonemobius socius. First-generation females of this population can lay mixtures of direct-developing and diapause eggs, and bet-hedging theory predicts that in an unpredictably variable environment the proportion of diapause eggs laid will gradually increase over the season as the likelihood that a second generation will be able to complete development before winter decreases. We quantified variability in the thermal regime using long-term meteorological records, and constructed an analytical model using empirical components for growth and reproduction. The model predicted that females should switch to diapause egg production in early August, a finding that was corroborated by experimental and field observations. The form of the switch between egg types predicted by the model was a transition that spanned only a few days and was similar to that estimated from a laboratory experiment. Thus interannual variation in climate was not sufficient for the evolution of a marked bet-hedging response in the form of a gradual increase in the proportion of diapause eggs. However, we observed considerable variation among females in their diapause strategies that remains unexplained.																	0012-9658	1939-9170				MAR	1997	78	2					442	451										WOS:A1997WN75400010						
J	Thibault, M; Blier, PU; Guderley, H				Thibault, M; Blier, PU; Guderley, H			Seasonal variation of muscle metabolic organization in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)	FISH PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY												This study examined how muscle metabolic organization varied during an annual cycle in which rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were held in outdoor holding ponds in which they were exposed to natural changes in temperature (range 0.2 to 15.6 degrees C) and photoperiod. We examined the activities of glycolytic and mitochondrial enzymes in red and white muscle to evaluate whether trout enhance their capacity for lipid and carbohydrate oxidation during cold-acclimization. When assayed at habitat temperature, the enzyme activities generally increased in spring to reach a maximum in summer followed by a decrease in the fall. This led to significantly higher activities at warm than cold periods for all enzymes measured in red muscle and all but one in white muscle. The activities at 10 degrees C provided little evidence for compensatory adjustments of aerobic capacity. Particularly in red muscle, enzyme levels at 10 degrees C were generally lower during cold than warm periods. The variation of enzyme activities throughout the cycle was not due to changes in protein concentration, as the same responses were observed when activities were expressed per g wet mass or per mg protein. Although the aerobic capacity did not increase with cold-acclimatization, the relative capacity for lipid oxidation was higher in winter than in summer trout. In contrast, the relative capacity for aerobic glycolysis was higher in summer than in winter trout. Thus, the metabolic capacities of trout muscle undergo seasonal reorganization.

J	Tanaka, K				Tanaka, K			Evolutionary relationship between diapause and cold hardiness in the house spider, Achaearanea tepidariorum (Araneae: Theridiidae)	JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY												The relationship between diapause and cold hardiness of the house spider, Achaearanea tepidariorum, differed geographically. In a cool-temperate population, enhanced chilling tolerance and supercooling ability were observed in diapause individuals, whereas a subtropical population showed only chilling tolerance, Because this spider is considered to be of tropical origin, it would follow that the ancestral diapause of this spider was equipped with chilling tolerance, but not with an increased supercooling ability, It seems that the ability to Lower the supercooling point evolved through natural selection in the course of expansion of this species to the northern climates.

J	Wegis, MC; Bradshaw, WE; Davison, TE; Holzapfel, CM				Wegis, MC; Bradshaw, WE; Davison, TE; Holzapfel, CM			Rhythmic components of photoperiodic time measurement in the pitcher-plant mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii	OECOLOGIA												Photoperiodic time measurement regulating larval diapause in the pitcher-plant mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii, varies in a close relationship with latitude. The critical photoperiod mediating the maintenance and termination of diapause is positively correlated with latitude (r(2) = 0.977) among six populations from southern (30-31 degrees N), intermediate (40 degrees N), and northern (46-49 degrees N) latitudes in North America. The developmental response to unnaturally short and to unnaturally long photoperiods declines with increasing latitude, so that longer critical photoperiods are associated with a downward rather than a lateral shift in the photoperiodic response curve. Exotic light and dark cycles of varying period (T) with a short (10 h) photophase and a scotophase ranging from 14 (T = 24) to 62 (T = 72) h, reveal two geographic patterns: a decline in perturbability of the photoperiodic clock with increasing latitude, and no change with latitude in the 21-h period of rising and falling development with increasing T. These results show (1) that there is a rhythmic component to photoperiodic time measurement in W. smithii, (2) that the period of this rhythm is about 21 h in all populations, and (3) that more northern populations show decreasing responsiveness to photoperiod and increasing stability against perturbation by exotic period lengths (T > 24). Previous studies on W. smithii indicate that this single temperate species of a tropical and subtropical genus has evolved from south to north. We therefore conclude that the evolution of increasing critical photoperiod in W. smithii during its adaptive radiation into North America has more likely involved the amplitude and not the period of the under lying circadian pacemaker.																	0029-8549					MAR	1997	110	1					32	39		10.1007/s004420050130								WOS:A1997WP45200005	28307466					
J	Jones, JT; Robertson, L; Perry, RN; Robertson, WM				Jones, JT; Robertson, L; Perry, RN; Robertson, WM			Changes in gene expression during stimulation and hatching of the potato cyst nematode Globodera rostochiensis	PARASITOLOGY												The potato cyst nematode (PCN) Globodera rostochiensis, like other parasitic nematodes, needs to synchronize its life-cycle with that of its host. This synchrony is achieved by the invasive-stage juvenile remaining dormant within its egg until stimulated to hatch by the presence of root diffusates of its host. Root diffusates may induce changes in gene expression in PCN, some of which may be important in the transition to a parasitic mode of existence. We have used a range of techniques including differential display to examine gene expression during stimulation and hatching of PCN. We find that few changes in gene expression appear to be induced directly by root diffusates. Instead, changes in gene expression seem to occur during or immediately after the hatching process. These results are discussed in the context of the host-parasite relationship.

J	DelSocorro, AP; Gregg, PC				DelSocorro, AP; Gregg, PC			Calling behaviour in M-convecta females under different temperature and photoperiodic conditions	PHYSIOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												The effects of temperature and photoperiod on calling behaviour in females of the Australian common armyworm, Mythimna convecta (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), were studied in the laboratory. Age at first calling was greater at 15 and 20 degrees C compared with 25 degrees C, but there were no significant differences between 25 and 30 degrees C. Females kept at 10 degrees C did not call, but if transferred at 10 days to 20 degrees C they called after a period similar to the pre-calling period at constant 20 degrees C. Onset time of calling was earlier at 15 and 20 degrees C compared with 25 and 30 degrees C, but there were no significant differences in calling duration. At 20 degrees C, age at first calling was increased by shorter daylength (12h and 14h, compared with 16h), and there was an interaction between daylength and moth age affecting the duration of calling. Onset times advanced with longer daylength, but peak calling was later in relation to the length of the scotophase. These results are discussed in connection with migration in M. convecta. Evidence for a circadian rhythm of calling was found in females entrained for 3 and 8 days after emergence under reverse-cycle conditions and then transferred to constant darkness. However, after 56h and 80h respectively of darkness, calling became de-synchronized. Subsequently, it appeared to re-synchronize to a different clock, which approximately correlated with the normal photoperiods the moths had experienced during larval development.				gregg, peter/E-9408-2011	gregg, peter/0000-0001-7534-3567												0307-6962					MAR	1997	22	1					20	28										WOS:A1997WU08100004						
J	Beasley, CA				Beasley, CA			Effects of environmental conditions on diapause in native populations of pink bollworm (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae)	SOUTHWESTERN ENTOMOLOGIST												Factors affecting induction and termination of diapause in pink bollworm, Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders), were studied in several trials with field-collected animals under simulated field conditions from 1983 to 1994. Percentage diapause on 1 Oct had a significant correlation of 0.883 with chill units during the 2-wk period 8-21 Sept. In controlled environments, induction of diapause was delayed by higher temperature (32 degrees C) combined with longer photoperiod (14:10 LD) and accelerated by cooler temperatures (30/15 degrees C) combined with shorter photoperiod (10:14 LD) Additionally, larvae exposed to the modified and controlled environmental regimes for a longer period of time experienced a greater effect. One-, two-, or three-day exposure to the high temperature and longer days had no effect on larval survival 20 days after the beginning of exposure for diapausing larvae cultured at the lower temperatures and shorter days for almost four months and returned to the original culture conditions after exposure. However, exposure for 14 d at the high temperature and long days caused a marked reduction in percentage of larvae remaining in diapause. Results for 5-d exposure at the warm temperature and long photoperiod were intermediate, Moisture, combined with increased temperature and day length, caused earlier release from diapause than increased temperature and day length alone.																	0147-1724					MAR	1997	22	1					11	27										WOS:A1997WU32800002						
J	Blem, CR				Blem, CR			Lipid reserves of the eastern cottonmouth (Agkistrodon piscivorus) at the northern edge of its range	COPEIA												Lipid reserves of the eastern cottonmouth (Agkistrodon piscivorus) at the northern edge of its range, near Hopewell, Virginia, were lowest in the spring and increased throughout the summer and early autumn. Most (91.7%) mature females (those larger than 619 mm SVL) were gravid or gave birth, supporting the contention that biennial reproduction in this species is an artifact of differential breeding rates among females of different sizes. Gravid females had lipid deposits significantly smaller than those of males and nongravid females during summer months when reserves were depleted during egg formation. Estimates of the energy requirement for hibernation indicate that some cottonmouths may have insufficient lipid reserves for survival over warm winters with mean hibernaculum temperatures > 6 C. Early spring lipid reserves remaining after hibernation decreased significantly with increased mean temperature of the previous winter. Mass of fat bodies was not an accurate measure of lipid reserve in this species because of significant amounts of lipid available from the rest of the body.																	0045-8511					FEB 18	1997		1					53	59		10.2307/1447839								WOS:A1997WK26000007

When eggs were kept under LD15:9, pupation in the Akita strain (bivoltine, 39 degrees N) was synchronized under both short and intermediate days with a larval stage of about 14 days. Under LD15 : 9 at 23 degrees C, the complete larval stage was 68 days because the mature larval stage lasted 40 days. In contrast, the larval stage in the Aichi strain (trivoltine, 35 degrees N) was 14 and 16 days under LD12 : 12 and 15 : 9, respectively. Under LD 14.5 : 9.5 at 23 degrees C, the larval stage was 60 days including the mature larval stage of 40 days. The critical photoperiod for the induction of summer diapause in both strains was shortened with increasing temperature. Photoperiods from LD14 : 10 to 15.5 : 8.5 in the egg stage did not influence the quantitative photoperiodic responses of either strain. C. oryzae entered a winter diapause in the first stadium when the egg stage was exposed to LD12 : 12 but the diapause was terminated by intermediate and long days in the larval stage. There was no clear influence of photoperiod on larval development in either strain after the termination of winter diapause.																	0003-6862					FEB	1997	32	1					63	74		10.1303/aez.32.63								WOS:A1997WL09100009

Each year, flies were recorded at a density of more than two flies per heifer from August/September to the following June, with peaks of abundance in mid to late spring and late summer to mid autumn. The seasonal trend of fly numbers was best correlated with the mean temperature 4 weeks prior to each fly count (correlation indices of P<0.01 in six of the nine fly periods) followed by the previous 4 week mean saturation deficit. Rainfall and relative humidity correlated poorly with the seasonality of H. irritans. Temperature appeared crucial at the beginning (late winter) and at the end (early-mid autumn) of the fly season while its relevance diminished in the middle of the season. The percentage of heifers that were infested decreased from 80-100% in the fly season to 0-55% between fly seasons but H. irritans never disappeared from the herds, indicating that if diapause occurs at the latitude of the study area, part of the fly population was not sensitive to diapause inducing factors.

The breaking of dormancy (oligopause) was studied in the laboratory by comparing the feeding activity and reproduction of adults collected in the held under different physiological conditions (i.e., dormant and non-dormant). No bugs were found in overwintering sites during the summer (December to February) and during early autumn (March). From mid-autumn to winter (April - August), the number of E. her-os captured in these sites gradually increased, decreasing thereafter with the start of spring in September. Dormant and nondormant E. heros taken to the laboratory and maintained at 25 +/- 1 degrees C, 65 +/- 5% rh., and L14:D10 photoperiod, and given suitable food (soybean pods or seeds), began feeding immediately. The number of stylet sheaths deposited/day on the food was greater for non-dormant than for dormant adults. Feeding activity was greater on immature pods than on mature seeds of soybean. Dormant females placed under suitable biotic and abiotic conditions took ca. 2 weeks to start reproduction, in contrast to non-dormant females, which reproduced immediately.																	0013-8703					FEB	1997	82	2					213	217		10.1046/j.1570-7458.1997.00132.x								WOS:A1997WM17300012

Because spiders are ectothermic animals, the temperature regime of the microhabitat in which an individual finds itself may affect important performance traits of that individual, The present study examined the effects of temperature on attributes of webs spun by Achaearanea tepidariorum (C. Koch), as well as testing temperature preference in this species. The effects of temperature on the amount of silk per web produced by Achaearanea tepidariorum and the prey-capture efficiency of webs produced at different temperatures were determined by using webs constructed at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 degrees C. The temperature preferences of A. tepidariorum within a thermal gradient were also determined, 2. Web mass was related to temperature, exhibiting a quadratic relation with a maximum web mass occurring at approximately 20 degrees C. 3. Number of strands per cm(3) of webs varied directly with web mass; webs with greater strand densities were more efficient at capturing flies. 4. The number of spiders observed in each temperature range in the thermal gradient indicated a non-uniform distribution, with the spiders avoiding temperatures in the highest range (27.3 +/- 2.0 degrees C). 5. These data suggest an optimal temperature for web construction at which webs produced are more efficient at capturing prey. The data also suggest that this species may avoid sites that do not provide an adequate thermal environment.																	0269-8463					FEB	1997	11	1					4	10		10.1046/j.1365-2435.1997.00040.x								WOS:A1997WR93700001						
B	Sharp, PJ		Kawashima, S; Kikuyama, S		Sharp, PJ			Comparative regulation of prolactin secretion	ADVANCES IN COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY, TOMES 1 AND 2					XIIIth International Congress of Comparative Endocrinology	NOV 16-21, 1997	YOKOHAMA, JAPAN	Japan Racing Assoc				Prolactin secretion changes seasonally in many vertebrates to control a wide range of responses to seasonal cues (e.g. changes in salinity, ambient temperature or photoperiod). These prolactin-dependent responses include changes in osmoregulation, reproductive activity and behaviour, and pelage. Information on the mechanisms involved in transducing these environmental signals into changes in prolactin secretion is mostly restricted to these involved in transducing photoperiodic information in birds and mammals. In birds, seasonal changes in prolactin secretion are controlled by the avian prolactin releasing hormone, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide. The pineal gland does not appear to play a role in the control of photoinduced prolactin release in birds. In contrast, in mammals, melatonin produced by the pineal gland plays a key role in the photoperiodic regulation of prolactin secretion. Melatonin regulates prolactin secretion, at least in part, by a direct action on the pituitary gland.																							1997							951	955										WOS:000072639100161

It has been suggested that there is some form of annual global variation which may be caused by extraterrestrial factors, The present study, utilizing an experimental animal model, investigated the ''month of birth effect'' in the northern hemisphere on the somatic and skeletal growth of rabbits. The study sample consisted of 135 laboratory bred and reared New Zealand white rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) from 62 different litters; spring/summer rabbits (n = 75) were born between February and July; fall/winter rabbits (n = 60) were born between August and January. Serial longitudinal body mass and craniofacial radiographic growth data were collected at 10, 25, 42, 84, and 126 days of age. Results from a two-way ANOVA showed no significant (P > 0.05) differences in the month of birth main effect or in the age x month of birth interaction for either somatic or skeletal growth, Results from the present study do not support the ''month of birth effect'' hypothesis, It was concluded that variations in growth patterns are more likely controlled by local environmental factors such as hemispheric seasonality in photoperiod or temperature, and not by more exotic factors such as the earth's orbital trajectory around the sun or global energy fields.

J	Menard, N; Vallet, D				Menard, N; Vallet, D			Behavioral responses of Barbary macaques (Macaca sylvanus) to variations in environmental conditions in Algeria	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY												In this study, the behavioral responses of Barbary macaques to seasonal and interhabitat variations in resource availability were analyzed over an entire annual cycle. Two groups, one in an evergreen cedar-oak forest (Djurdjura) and the other in a deciduous oak forest (Akfadou), were observed. In this paper, references to data on resource availability published elsewhere are made. Time budget has been studied. Variations in foraging and moving time, in day-range lengths, and in time moving in trees have been considered to estimate the variations in foraging effort and thus energy expenditure. Great monthly variations in foraging effort and other activities were observed in both habitats. In early spring, when resource availabilities were maximal, foraging effort was low while monkeys maximized their feeding time (about 5 h/day). In June, during the peak of the birth season and the rearing period, monkeys minimized their feeding time to the benefit of social interactions (to 1.6-2.7 h/day), whatever the food availability, which was low in Akfadou and high in Djurdjura. In addition, foraging effort remained low in Djurdjura, while it increased in Akfadou. Thus, at the beginning of the dry summer period, monkeys in Akfadou were in a less favorable position than those in Djurdjura. At both sites, in periods of food shortage in summer or in winter, monkeys displayed two different strategies. In the former case, their foraging effort increased, while in the second one it remained relatively low. Whatever the foraging effort, monkeys did not reach the same amount of feeding time as in early spring. In the poorest site of Akfadou, foraging effort was globally greater than in the richest site of Djurdjura, especially for adults. At both sites, adult males spent more time feeding than juveniles and less time in social interactions. Results are discussed according to rearing period, temperatures, and day length constraints. The limits of adaptability to different habitats are considered in light of the demographic parameters.

After 24 weeks this range became narrower again. Effects of dehydration and dry storage on germination capacity depended on the provenance, the duration of pretreatment preceding dehydration, the seed m.c. after dehydration, the storage temperature and the duration of storage. When pretreated seeds with a m.c. of 30% were stored at -2 degrees C, no decrease in germination capacity was observed during at least four months. It is postulated that seeds withstand dehydration during the phase of dormancy breakage, whereas dehydration after completion of that phase results in irreversible damage in the metabolically active seeds, that otherwise may start early germinative events, although radicle protrusion is prevented.																			0-7923-4363-8				1997	30						269	278										WOS:A1997BH23T00031

When tested under standard germination conditions, they were unresponsive to light but under unfavourable germination conditions they tended to be inhibited by light. After prolonged exposure to sub-optimal germination conditions in darkness rape seed exhibited light sensitivity. Their germinability in darkness was considerably reduced, whilst their germinability in light was high. This light sensitivity was subsequently lost. Seeds being transferred from darkness to light during the germination test were not able to react to light any more. So, during germination tests in darkness seeds developed skotodormancy. Generally, there was no change of germinability when rape seed were imbibed under sub-optimal germination conditions in light. In one cultivar light inhibition was imposed but seeds of this cultivar remained highly germinable in darkness as well. So, after imbibition in light rape seed were never dormant in darkness. A pot experiment carried out to test the conclusions of the previous laboratory experiments under a more natural environment confirmed the strong impact of the light environment on the ability of rape seed to persist in darkness. It also confirmed genotypic differences identified in the laboratory studies.

It is unfortunate that, in spite of considerable effort and voluminous literature, we are still uncertain about the physiological and molecular mechanisms involved in these processes. But take heart, for sometimes such knowledge is not necessary, and may not even be helpful for predicting what will happen under different circumstances to populations or organisms such as seeds. Solutions to practical problems, however, often demand quantitative predictions which are valid in a wide range of circumstances; and such solutions are sometimes achievable. Nevertheless, the possibilities of productive interactions between those concerned with fundamental problems and those concerned with practical problems are increasing, and this series of International Workshops provides important opportunities to encourage this symbiosis.																			0-7923-4363-8				1997	30						R17	R25										WOS:A1997BH23T00001						
J	Nielsen, JK				Nielsen, JK			Variation in defences of the plant Barbarea vulgaris and in counteradaptations by the flea beetle Phyllotreta nemorum	ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA												Several sorts of variation in the interaction between the insect, Phyllotreta nemorum L. (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Alticinae), and the plant, Barbarea vulgaris R.Br. (Brassicaceae), have been discovered: 1) genetic differences in the levels of defences in the plant, 2) genetic differences in the ability of insects to cope with the plant defences, 3) seasonal variation in levels of defences in the plant, and 4) differences between leaf types in levels of defences. Two plant accessions were suitable for larval development throughout the season while the remaining nine accessions were more or less unsuitable for larvae from the 'susceptible' T-population at least at certain times of the year. All accessions were suitable for the 'resistant' E-population throughout the year. There was a seasonal variation in levels of defences in some accessions which were unsuitable for the T- population during the summer period when beetles were present, but not during autumn and spring when the beetles were hibernating. Upper (younger) cauline leaves of these accessions had higher levels of defences than lower (older) cauline leaves. The resistant E-population used B. vulgaris as a natural host plant while the susceptible T-population did not. The use of B. vulgaris as a natural host plant by the E- population of P. nemorum seems to be an extension of the host plant range of the species. Variation in plant defences may have facilitated the switch in host plant use by the resistant flea beetle population.																	0013-8703					JAN	1997	82	1					25	35		10.1046/j.1570-7458.1997.00110.x								WOS:A1997WJ17700004

J	Volkovich, TA; Blumental, NA				Volkovich, TA; Blumental, NA			Photo-thermoperiodic responses in some species of lacewings (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae): Their role in diapause induction	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY												The effects of combinations of photoperiod and temperature on diapause induction in six species of lacewings (Chrysopidae) from the forest-steppe zone (Russia, 50 degrees N) were examined. Diapause induction in the short day was temperature-independent ill all species, with exception of Chrysopa phyllochroma. In this species the incidence of diapause decreased within the range from 25 to 33 degrees C. The long day prevented diapause only within particular temperature limits, which were species specific. In species with typical long-day photoperiodic response (C. perla, C. septempunctata and Chrysoperla carnea) daily temperature fluctuations were less favourable to diapause induction than constant mean temperature. In C. phyllochroma and C. abbreviata the similar high incidence of diapausing prepupae was induced both by daily natural thermoperiods and constant mean temperature. In experiments carried out under 12-h thermophase: 12-h cryophase conditions it was revealed that photo-thermoperiodic responses of C. phyllochroma were significantly dependent on cryophase temperature, whereas diapause of C. perla was determined mainly by photoperiod. The diversity of seasonal cycles in Chrysopa species and the role of photoperiod and thermoperiod in the development and diapause control in nature are discussed.																	1210-5759						1997	94	4					435	444										WOS:A1997YA63100003						
J	Belmonte, G; Cavallo, A				Belmonte, G; Cavallo, A			Body size and its variability in the copepod Acartia margalefi (Calanoida) from Lake Acquatina (SE Italy)	ITALIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												A long-term study on the body size of adult copepods was carried out on the Acartia margalefi population of Lake Acquatina in 1988-1991. Males were unusually longer than females independently from the season or the year. The specimens (both sexes) collected during cold months were longer than those collected during warm months. The body size of A. margalefi was strongly correlated with temperature. A correlation was found also with photoperiod, salinity and (but only for females) with adult sex-ratio and population density. The average body size of 1988-specimens proved statistically different from other years. Specimens collected from the lake were smaller than those from the sea, where in addition they did not show any sex size-dimorphism. These results suggest that the body size of A. margalefi (a species adapted to variable environments) is inversely correlated with favourable conditions for reproduction, and it shows a different variability range in the two sexes probably due to the different cost of gametogenesis in two sexes.																	1125-0003	1748-5851					1997	64	4					377	382		10.1080/11250009709356225								WOS:000071907000011

During November almost all of the C. finmarchicus population in both regions was present as C5(r) with a small proportion of C4 and females. There were very few animals on GB. In the southern GOM about a third of the C. finmarchicus population was in the upper 80 m and actively feeding; the remainder were below 120 m. On GB the C. finmarchicus population was also feeding; gut pigment content in both areas was between 3 and 13 ng copepod(-1). About one third of the adult females on GB were reproductively active while none in the GOM were reproductively active. By January C. finmarchicus C6 females formed a large proportion of the older stage animals on the Bank and in surface waters of the southern GOM. These were actively feeding and reproducing with a large cohort of young nauplii of C. finmarchicus present in the southern GOM and smaller numbers on the northeast peak of the Bank. There were very few C. finmarchicus nauplii on the crest of the Bank or on the southern flank. Based on abundances and stage composition, it appeared that spawning began in late December and that repopulation of the Bank took place in the region of the NE peak, with nauplii and reproductively active females being transported onto this region of the Bank from the GOM.																	0171-8630						1997	151	1-3					103	114		10.3354/meps151103								WOS:A1997XE68700011

The upper lethal temperature was between 31.5 and 32.5 degrees C and the lower lethal temperature between 9 and 10 degrees C. Between 10 and 12.5 degrees C, the alga survived without any growth; new stolons and new fronds developed at 15 and 17.5 degrees C, respectively. Stolen growth was strongly correlated with the temperature increase. No morphological changes were observed when the cuttings were cultured within the vital temperature range (10 to 31.5 degrees C). The new fronds and stolons developed on the cuttings under a very weak light intensity of photosynthetically active radiation (27 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) at a photoperiod cycle of 14 h light:10 h dark). The most favorable range of light intensity was between 88 and 338 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) (14 h light:10 h dark). These light and temperature responses confer to the Mediterranean strain C. taxifolia, introduced in 1984, a large potential for expansion throughout the Mediterranean Sea and also in adjacent tropical and temperate seas.																	0171-8630					JAN	1997	146	1-3					145	153		10.3354/meps146145								WOS:A1997WL39000015						
J	Randolph, SE				Randolph, SE			Abiotic and biotic determinants of the seasonal dynamics of the tick Rhipicephalus appendiculatus in South Africa	MEDICAL AND VETERINARY ENTOMOLOGY												The creation of a generic population model for the tick Rhipicephalus appendiculatus requires a detailed, quantified understanding of the interactions of these ticks with their biotic and abiotic environment in the different parts of their range, from the tropical regions of East Africa to the temperate regions of South Africa. The much greater seasonal variation in climatic conditions, particularly temperature, further from the equator introduces variable development rates and diapause into the life cycle. Estimates of natural temperature-dependent interstadial development periods, derived from a combination of published laboratory and field data, were applied to published data on the seasonal abundance of R.appendiculatus on three farms in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. This enabled an assessment of which ticks of one stage give rise to which ticks of the next stage, from which (a) the onset and duration of diapause in unfed adults, and (b) seasonal interstadial mortality indices in the form of k-values, could be estimated. The contribution of biotic (tick density) and abiotic (climatic) factors as predictors of mortality at each life stage was investigated by step-wise multiple regression. Density-independent mortality at the female-to-larval stage is correlated with geographically variable climatic factors, minimum temperature at two farms and minimum relative humidity at the third. The other two stages are governed by density-dependent mortality, which, it is argued, may be caused largely by the hosts' acquired resistance to ticks. As expected on theoretical grounds, this density dependence is weaker nearer to the edge of the tick's range and for the more vulnerable immature stages.																	0269-283X					JAN	1997	11	1					25	37		10.1111/j.1365-2915.1997.tb00286.x								WOS:A1997WK47000005	9061674					
J	Jones, ME; Grigg, GC; Beard, LA				Jones, ME; Grigg, GC; Beard, LA			Body temperatures and activity patterns of Tasmanian devils (Sarcophilus harrisii) and eastern quells (Dasyurus viverrinus) through a subalpine winter	PHYSIOLOGICAL ZOOLOGY												During a held study of carnivorous dasyurid marsupials in subalpine Tasmania, the trapping success for Tasmanian devils (Sarcophilus harrisii), but not for spotted-tailed quells (Dasyurus maculatus) or eastern quells (Dasyurus viverrinus), was significantly lower when winter weather conditions turned to sleet or snow or when deep snow lay on the ground. This field study was instigated to determine if devils and eastern quells spend more time in burrows in severe weather conditions and if they enter torpor. Torpor is known to occur in eutherian mammals as large as devils and in a similar-sized congeneric marsupial, the western quoll (Dasyurus geoffroyi). Using radiotelemetry, body temperatures of Tasmanian devils and eastern quells ranging freely in their natural habitat were monitored throughout winter. Neither species was observed in torpor, even under prolonged severe weather conditions, and the number of hours spent active did not differ between summer and winter or between moderate and severe winter weather conditions. Body temperatures averaged 36.5 degrees C (SD = 0.079, range of 33.5 degrees-38.6 degrees C) for the three male eastern quells and 35.7 degrees C (SD = 0.575, range of 31.3 degrees-37.5 degrees C) for the four (male and female) devils. A diel cycle in body temperature occurred in both species; temperatures rose each evening when animals became active, remained high throughout the night despite ambient temperatures falling to the diel minima, and were lower during the day when the individuals were inactive in dens. The amplitude of this cycle was greater in eastern quells (1.1 degrees C, SD = 0.142) than in devils (0.6 degrees C, SD = 0.252).

J	Zarazaga, LA; Malpaux, B; Chemineau, P				Zarazaga, LA; Malpaux, B; Chemineau, P			The characteristics of the melatonin secretory rhythm are not modified by the stage of pregnancy in ewes	REPRODUCTION NUTRITION DEVELOPMENT												An experiment was designed to study if, in the same animals, characteristics of the plasma melatonin rhythm vary during pregnancy in ewes. Thirteen Ile-de-France ewes were maintained in natural photoperiod and measurements of the characteristics of the rhythm of melatonin secretion were determined during one estrous cycle and then during pregnancy. Duration and mean plasma concentrations of the nocturnal melatonin elevation were measured at four stages of pregnancy. Melatonin concentrations during the elevation were not significantly affected by the stage of the estrous cycle (mean +/- SEM: 227.8 +/- 34.9, 263.2 +/- 24.2 and 232.4 +/- 27.1 pg/mL for follicular phase, early luteal phase and late luteal phase, respectively), or by the stage of pregnancy (292.8 +/- 22.2, 268.7 +/- 21.7, 267.4 +/- 27.9 and 258.3 +/- 23.5 pg/mL for first, second, third and fourth month of pregnancy, respectively). A strong individual effect was detected (P < 0.01) for melatonin concentrations during elevation (range: 119.2 +/- 11.8 to 396.6 +/- 26.0 pg/mL of plasma). A highly significant correlation coefficient was observed within individuals for night melatonin concentrations between the different physiological stages. It was concluded that melatonin secretion is unaffected by the stage of pregnancy.

J	Loomis, SH; Hand, SC; Fell, PE				Loomis, SH; Hand, SC; Fell, PE			Metabolism of gemmules from the freshwater sponge Eunapius fragilis during diapause and post-diapause states	BIOLOGICAL BULLETIN												Post-diapause gemmules of the freshwater sponge Eunapius fragilis remained quiescent when maintained at 5 degrees C. Germination occurred within 48 to 72 h following warming to 20 degrees-23 degrees C, culminating with the emergence of a new sponge from the collagenous capsule, Both heat dissipation and oxygen consumption climbed steadily during germination and eventually reached 600% of the starting values, By comparison, energy flow was much lower over the same period of time in diapausing gemmules, clearly demonstrating metabolic depression during diapause, The calorimetric:respirometric (CR) ratio increased significantly from -354 kJ/mol O-2 to -541 kJ/mol O-2 between hours 3.5 and 56.5 of germination, with an average value across this period of about -495 kJ/mol O-2. The low CR ratio at hour 12.5 (-374 +/- 21; +/- 1 SE, n = 3) was statistically below the oxycaloric equivalent, which suggests that gemmules may have experienced hypoxia during the more than 3 months of storage at 5 degrees C prior to experiments, The increase in metabolism during germination could be blocked by perfusing the gemmules with nitrogen-saturated medium (nominally oxygen free). Developing gemmules were able to survive oxygen limitation for several hours at least; during that time energy flow was depressed to 6% of normoxic values. During germination, the range of values was 3.5 to 4.0 nmol/mg protein for ATP, 0.2 to 0.4 nmol/mg protein for ADP, and 0.5 to 0.8 nmol/mg protein for AMP. Because ATP was high even before gemmules were warmed to room temperature, it is unlikely that levels were severely compromised during the diapause condition.																	0006-3185					DEC	1996	191	3					385	392		10.2307/1543011								WOS:A1996WA83400006

Studies were conducted at constant temperatures in the range 10.0-29.4 degrees C, 14 L:10D photoperiod, and 50-70% R.H. Total developmental time (from egg to adult) in A. albipodus increased from 10.1 days at 29.4 degrees C to 27.9 days at 15.5 degrees C. Adult parasites did not emerge from mummies at 10 degrees C (although pharate adults were recovered by dissection). The thermal requirements for the egg-mummy, mummy-adult, and egg-adult developmental periods were estimated, respectively, as r = 7.62, 9.15, and 8.56 degrees C, and K = 100.30, 107.31, and 208.24 degree-days. The upper developmental threshold was considered to be above 29.4 degrees C because development did not cease and did not appear to be affected by that temperature. The possibility of hibernal dormancy or diapause as well as the potential for successful establishment in California, USA, in A. albipodus are discussed.																	0931-2048					DEC	1996	120	10					631	637		10.1111/j.1439-0418.1996.tb01663.x								WOS:A1996WC10200009						
J	Demas, GE; Klein, SL; Nelson, RJ				Demas, GE; Klein, SL; Nelson, RJ			Reproductive and immune responses to photoperiod and melatonin are linked in Peromyscus subspecies	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY A-SENSORY NEURAL AND BEHAVIORAL PHYSIOLOGY												The effects of photoperiod and melatonin treatment on reproductive and immune function were assessed in two subspecies of Peromyscus maniculatus from different latitudes of origin. In experiment 1, P. m. bairidii (latitude = 42 degrees 51' N) and P. m. luteus (latitude = 30 degrees 37' N) were housed in either long (LD 16:8) or short days (LD 8:16) for 8 weeks. Short-day P. Mt. bairdii displayed reproductive regression and elevated splenocyte proliferation in response to the T-cell mitogen concanavalin A, as compared to long-day mice. In contrast, P. m. luteus did not undergo reproductive regression or exhibit any increase in lymphocyte proliferation in short days. In experiment 2, individuals of both P. m. bairdii and P. m. luteus were implanted with empty capsules or capsules that contained melatonin. Individual P. m. bairdii implanted with melatonin underwent reproductive regression. Individuals of this subspecies also displayed elevated lymphocyte proliferation compared to control mice. Conversely, P. m. luteus implanted with melatonin did not undergo reproductive regression and displayed no significant changes in lymphocyte proliferation. These results suggest that reproductive responsiveness to melatonin mediates short-day enhancement of immune function in deer mice. These data also imply that melatonin may not possess universal immunoenhancing properties. Rather, the effectiveness of melatonin to influence immune responses may be constrained by reproductive responsiveness to this indole-amine.

J	Dautel, H; Knulle, W				Dautel, H; Knulle, W			The supercooling ability of ticks (Acari, Ixodoidea)	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY												The supercooling capacity of nine laboratory-held species of ticks originating from different geographical areas, as well as five field-collected species from Germany, was investigated. All but one tick species showed mean supercooling points between about - 17 and - 23 degrees C, suggesting that the capacity to supercool to temperatures of less than or equal to - 17 degrees C might be an inherent property of many tick species unrelated to their geographic origin. Photoperiod did not influence the mean supercooling point in any of the species and there was also no distinct seasonal pattern of supercooling in seasonally acclimatized Dermacentor marginatus. Thus, the supercooling ability was independent of the presence/absence of diapause. The finding of thermal hysteresis in D. marginatus hemolymph raises the question of whether or not anti-freeze proteins are involved in the supercooling capacity of that species. An interspecies comparison revealed a weak negative correlation between relative water content and supercooling point of the ticks and an even weaker correlation between body mass or body water mass and the supercooling point. Since the ticks exhibited low supercooling points both before and shortly after feeding, the blood used as food should lack potent ice nucleators.																	0174-1578					DEC	1996	166	8					517	524		10.1007/s003600050040								WOS:A1996VW93100008	8981761

Critical night lengths (CNLs) for gynopara and male production (CNLs: 50% of maximum production) and inter-clonal differences, defined by the different forms of progeny produced at a single discriminating night length (12 h 30 min), were measured at 16 +/- 1 degrees C. The aphid clones differed in CNL and in the morphs produced at the discriminating night length. These differences were used to investigate the inheritance of the photoperiodic response. In crosses between clones the photoperiodic response showed considerable overall variation. The variation in CNLs indicated that the photoperiodic response was unlikely to affect the overwintering success after long-distance movement of clones from one latitude to another.																	0307-6962	1365-3032				DEC	1996	21	4					297	303		10.1111/j.1365-3032.1996.tb00868.x								WOS:A1996WA98500007

Its population structure was studied in a German sand dune region. This region is partly forested and partly used as arable land. Only four small isolated dune areas still persist, two of which had been restored in 1989. Bridging a distance of 600 m, C. hybrida colonized one of the newly restored areas immediately. The other newly restored area is very small and surrounded by a forest. It has not been colonized since the end of 1990. Larvae and adults exclusively use bare patches without denser vegetation. Even shading by single trees deteriorates habitat quality. Small scale migration between adjacent patches is usually rare but increases significantly at specific periods of the year. Male home range is significantly larger than that of females. Most individuals need two vegetation periods to mature. Two generations follow one another in the course of one vegetation period. Therefore, different developmental stages of C. hybrida hibernate and are present simultanously during spring and summer. This desynchronized phenology is considered to be an adaptation to an ''unpredictable'' environment, thus minimizing the risk of local extinction.																	0012-0073					NOV 22	1996	43	2					251	264										WOS:A1996VY81800006

Under long daylength (greater than or equal to 14 h), most larvae of all populations pupated after the 4th to 6th stadium without diapause. In three populations (Ayabe, Ino and Naze), larvae reared. under shorter daylength (less than or equal to 13 h) went through about two more larval moltings and eventually entered diapause. In contrast, the southernmost (Ishigaki) and northern two (Akita and Oyama) populations did not manifest a clear photoperiodic response at the temperature tested. Geographic variation of photoperiodic response in the four southwestern populations (Ayabe, Ino, Naze and Ishigaki) was considered to exhibit a clinal change, while responses of the northern two populations (Akita and Oyama) showed discontinuous trend.																	0003-6862					NOV	1996	31	4					495	504		10.1303/aez.31.495								WOS:A1996VV49800005						
J	Sota, T				Sota, T			Altitudinal variation in life cycles of Carabid beetles: Life-cycle strategy and colonization in alpine zones	ARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												In carabid beetles, species with both larval and adult overwintering diapause may be advantaged in colonizing alpine zones compared with species without larval overwintering, which have to complete development during a short summer. The ability to diapause in two developmental stages facilitates a shift from an annual (univoltine) to a biennial (semivoltine) life cycle, which is an advantage in cool habitats. To test this hypothesis, I studied altitudinal variation in the life cycles of the subtribe Carabina (Coleoptera, Carabidae, Carabini) at altitudes from 750 m (below the subalpine zone) to 2800 m (alpine zone) in central Honshu, Japan. Of seven species occurring in the study area, five had annual life cycles with adult overwintering and were distributed below the subalpine zone (<2200 m). Two closely related Leptocarabus species overwintered as larvae in the first winter and as adults in the second and later years; one species occurred at altitudes from 750 to 2200 m, and its life cycle changed from annual to biennial in the subalpine zone. The other smaller species occurred from subalpine to alpine zones and had a biennial life cycle. These species showed a continuous decline of body size with increasing altitude. Thus, two species with larval overwintering had wider altitudinal ranges and colonized higher altitudes than other five species without larval overwintering, but there was an interspecific difference in the life cycle strategy between the two species, which was correlated with the difference in the altitudinal range of each species.																	0004-0851					NOV	1996	28	4					441	447		10.2307/1551855								WOS:A1996VZ65700005						
J	Boiteau, G; Coleman, W				Boiteau, G; Coleman, W			Cold tolerance in the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae)	CANADIAN ENTOMOLOGIST												The seasonal change in the level of cold tolerance in a field population of Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say), is described for a northern location. Survival of overwintering adult beetles is highest from September through January. After that it falls to a lower level that is maintained until beetle emergence in May or June. The seasonal change in the level of cold tolerance is parallel to the change in the intensity of diapause but not to the change in the low temperature exotherm. The value of the low temperature exotherm is variable but averages -8.8 degrees C for active beetles on plants and -11.7 degrees C for soil-collected overwintering beetles in their deep diapause phase. Experimental results suggest that reduction of the gut content and increase in the amount of body fat in diapausing beetles is sufficient to lower the low temperature exotherm by a few degrees. The diapausing state itself, without cold acclimation, is sufficient to increase cold tolerance. However, results suggest that it is not the level of cold tolerance of the Colorado potato beetle provided by the diapausing process that has allowed this species to extend its range northward into New Brunswick but its accompanying burrowing behaviour.																	0008-347X					NOV-DEC	1996	128	6					1087	1099		10.4039/Ent1281087-6								WOS:A1996WB76900010

The target sites for melatonin are poorly known in fish, especially marine species. A radioligand study was undertaken using the gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) maintained under natural temperature and photoperiod (at 28 degrees N latitude). This species exhibits the property of changing sex during growth. Brains of one year-old males were collected at 16:00h and brains of three year-old females at 03:00, 10:00, 16:00 and 23:00h. Membrane homogenate receptor assays were run using 2-[(125)] iodomelatonin as a ligand. Binding sites were detected in brains of young and old fish. In the younger, they exhibited a B-max between 3.52 and 4.29 fmol mg protein(-1) and a K-D between 358-380 pmol l(-1). In the older fish, the K-D varied according to a daily pattern: values were three times higher at 03:00 and 10:00h (500-600 pmol l(-1)) than at 16:00 and 23:00h (150-300 pmol l(-1)). The number of sites also were higher at 03:00 and 10:00h (180-200 fmol mg protein(-1)) than at 16:00 and 23:00h (95-110 fmol mg protein(-1)). Melatonin and iodomelatonin displaced 2-[I-125]iodomelatonin binding in a dose dependent manner, the second being more potent than the first. Binding was also inhibited by GTP. The results provide the first evidence for the presence of membrane melatonin binding sites in the brain of an exclusively marine fish. They suggest that their number and affinity varies during growth and throughout a light/dark cycle. Future experiments will aim to precise the anatomical location and role of these binding sites.

Runoff rates and interrill erosion were measured by using simulated rainfall within a shortgrass community in five grass cover classes during the growing and dormant seasons. Differences in runoff and interrill erosion were found between classes of grass cover during both seasons. Runoff and interrill erosion are affected mostly by basal cover of grasses, aerial cover of grasses, organic matter, soil water content, sand content and percentage of cover by rock and gravel.

The main purposes of this study are to characterize the intracellular and extracellular responses of cells in superficial layers of entorhinal cortex (EC) in chronically epileptic animals, determine whether their altered physiology is dependent on being connected to hippocampus, and investigate whether there is evidence of augmented excitation and inhibitory interneuron disconnection. 2. Functional connectivity was maintained between the hippocampal area and the EC in vitro in a combined rat hippocampal-parahippocampal slice preparation by slicing with a vibratome at a 30-deg angle to the base of the brain. Three groups of animals were studied: naive animals, animals that had experienced a previous episode of (nonconvulsive) self-sustaining limbic system status elilepticus (SSLSE) induced by electrical stimulation resulting in a chronically epileptic slate, and animals in an electrode control group. Tn chronically epileptic rats and the electrode control group, studies were done on tissue contralateral to the side of electrode implantation. 3. Extracellular and intracellular recordings were made from the superficial layers of EC. Neurons in the superficial layers of the EC were activated by stimulation of the deep layers within the EC or the angular bundle adjacent to the EC, which contains axons from EC neurons. Responses could be elicited by antidromic and synaptic mechanisms by stimulation at tither site. Tn addition, a monosynaptic protocol was used that involved direct activation of interneurons with a stimulating electrode placed near the recording electrode in the presence of the ionotropic glutamate blockers D(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV) and 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2-3-dione (DNQX). 4. Responses were collected over a range of stimulus intensities, from very low to high intensities, to construct input/output function (I/O) curves. Amplitudes and durations were measured at the lowest stimulus intensity that elicited a maximum response. 5. Extracellular field potential responses from electrode controls did not differ from naives qualitatively with respect to morphology of field potential responses or quantitatively with respect to response duration and amplitude. Field potential responses in tissue from post-SSLSE rats differed markedly in morphology from naive and electrode controls. being more complex, significantly longer in duration, and decreased in amplitude. These epileptiform responses were shortened markedly by blockade of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors with APV, but this manipulation did not con vert responses to a normal morphology. These responses were abolished by blockade of non-NMDA mediated ionotropic glutamate receptors with DNQX. 6. During intracellular recordings of neurons in slices from both control and epileptic animals, neurons were quiescent under resting conditions in the absence of electrical stimulation. 7. Intracellular responses in electrode controls were identical to naive, and together were considered ''controls.'' In control tissue, evoked intracellular responses were similar to those previously described and most commonly consisted of an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) that was blocked partially by the NMDA-receptor antagonist APV, followed by hyperpolarizing potentials, which were identified electrophysiologically and pharmacologically as gamma-aminobuturic acid-A (GABA(A))- and GABA(B)-receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs). EPSPs were blocked completely by DNQX. 8. Tn chronically epileptic tissue, evoked inh acellular responses differed markedly from responses in control animals? exhibiting all-or-none prolonged paroxysmal depolarizing events with multiple superimposed action potentials in response to a single shock. These depolarizing events were reduced in duration and amplitude, but not abolished, in APV. IPSPs were not seen or markedly reduced at all stimulus intensities. These intracellular responses never resembled control responses. Intracellular responses correlated precisely in morphology and duration with extracellular field potentials. 9. In chronically epileptic tissue with the monosynaptic protocol used to directly activate inhibitory interneurons, hyperpolarizing potentials were evoked that were electrophysiologically and pharmacologically identified as GABA(A)- and GABA(B)-receptor-mediated IPSPs and did not differ from monosynaptic IPSPs in control animals. 10. The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that superficial layer EC cells are hyperexcitable, as in CA1, in this model and that this is due to augmented excitation and impaired inhibition, possibly because GABAergic inhibitory interneurons are dormant (disconnected from excitatory input). 11. These results constitute the first study of the EC in an animal model of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy and provide evidence of electrophysiologic changes outside of the hippocampus.																	0022-3077					NOV	1996	76	5					2928	2940										WOS:A1996VT08200012	8930245					
J	Honek, A; Martinkova, Z				Honek, A; Martinkova, Z			Geographic variation in seed dormancy among populations of Echinochloa crus-galli	OECOLOGIA												In 1991-1993, we investigated the incidence of seed dormancy in 25 local populations of barnyard grass, Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) P.Beauv., in the western Czech Republic. The percentage of germination after 4 months after:ripening of dry seeds at 25 degrees C varied between 0.0 and 83.6%. Although there were significant annual differences in the percentage of germination at some localities, typical proportions of dormant seeds persisted over 3 years at field sites where the seed bank was not disturbed. One-way ANOVA (using data from 14 cultivated or abandoned fields) revealed that 73.0% of variance in seed dormancy incidence could be attributed to the effect of locality (P < 0.001). Incidence of dormancy was not con-elated with mother plant stature (dry above-ground biomass, number of tillers, maximal stem height) nor seed mass. There was a significant correlation (r(2) = 0.403, P < 0.005) between dormancy incidence at natural localities in 1991 and in F-1 offspring sown at experimental grounds at Praha-Ruzyne in 1992. The results indicate that heredity is important in maintaining local variation in seed dormancy, probably favoured by the self-pollinating reproduction of barnyard grass.																	0029-8549					NOV	1996	108	3					419	423		10.1007/BF00333716								WOS:A1996VW51200003	28307856					
J	Onstad, DW; Brewer, EF				Onstad, DW; Brewer, EF			Modeling induction of diapause in North American Ostrinia nubilalis (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) populations	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												A general model for predicting diapause induction in most North American populations of European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner), was created by statistically testing the influence of scotophase, civil twilight (the period before sunrise or after sunset when the sun is 6 degrees below the horizon), temperature, and latitude in equations calibrated with and validated against laboratory and field data. The best equation includes scotophase as hours of darkness per day, mean temperature, and latitude in decimal degrees. To predict diapause induction in the field, a larval maturation model and a function for determining the response of different larval instars must be calculated along with the basic equation. In the field, scotophase should be calculated by subtracting daylength and civil twilight from 24 h. The overall model explained about half the variability in the independent data for European corn borer populations in North America between 30 and 50 degrees N latitude.																	0046-225X					OCT	1996	25	5					1140	1146		10.1093/ee/25.5.1140								WOS:A1996VR84800035

The eggs and spermatophores display a moderate drought resistence. The adults, during mating and larvae leave the soil and are to be found on the soil surface. The host range of the parasitic larva is restricted to Saltatoria. The larval growth is much greater than that of other instars of E. trigonum; however, no damage or other effects on the hosts were obvious and usually the hosts survived parasitism. The active post-larval instars of E. trigonum are predatory and feed exclusively on the eggs of Acrididae. The life cycle of E. trigonum is uni- to semi-voltine and is synchronized by an obligatory diapause of the adult instar before reproduction.																	0168-8162					OCT	1996	20	10					545	561		10.1007/BF00052806								WOS:A1996VV58000001						
J	Olesen, JM				Olesen, JM			From Naivete to experience: Bumblebee queens (Bombus terrestris) foraging on Corydalis cava (Fumariaceae)	JOURNAL OF THE KANSAS ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY												Pollination of Corydalis cava (Fumariaceae), an obligately self-incompatible forest spring herb with a complex Bower, was studied outside the range of its specialist pollinator, a long-tongued anthophorid bee. Here, the major pollinators were queens of the short-tongued opportunistic Bombus terrestris (Hymenoptera: Apidae) that had newly emerged from hibernation. Flowering of the C. cava population lasted 39 days, with a peak on the 14th day. During the first 14 days of the flowering period, bumblebees collected pollen (i.e., pollinated), perforated the flower spur and robbed the nectar (i.e., primary nectar-robbery). Over the first nine of these days, they perforated the flower spur at random. Then, during the following five days, they learned to locate the nectar and placed most holes in spurs where the surface of the nectar was located. After having perforated most of the flowers, queens changed their behavior to the slightly faster method of secondary nectar-robbing, i.e., using old nectar-robbing holes. Thus, plants with a specialized floral morphology which indicates a tight evolutionary history with specialist pollinators may survive without these specialists at their range margin through pollination interactions with opportunistic Bower foragers.

J	AlSaffar, ZY; Grainger, JNR; Aldrich, J				AlSaffar, ZY; Grainger, JNR; Aldrich, J			Temperature and humidity affecting development, survival and weight loss of the pupal stage of Drosophila melanogaster, and the influence of alternating temperature on the larvae	JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY												1. The mean durations of development in the pupae of Drosophila melanogaster (Meigen) and their survival were measured at combinations of six constant temperatures (15, 20, 22.5, 25, 27.5 and 30 degrees C) and up to 11 levels of relative humidity. The thermal survival range for the pupae is between 15 and 30 degrees C, and the humidity viable range is between 60 and 100% RH. 2. The percentage water loss of the pupae was measured at six constant temperatures and four levels of relative humidity; There was a rapid increase in the percentage of water lost during the first 24 h exposure at all tested conditions. However, pupae reared at 100% RH at each constant temperature, sustained the lowest water loss. The percentage water loss increased as temperature increased, as humidity decreased and also with time. 3. The duration of larval development studied at six constant temperatures (15, 20, 22.5, 25, 27.5 and 30 degrees C) was inversely related to temperature. A wide range of alternating temperature regimes had a small, though statistically significant, accelerative effect on larval developmental time. Thus, the present results may be used as a basis for modelling development under changing temperatures, with the assumption that the developmental rate is nearly identical to that from a series of constant temperatures.

J	Norrbin, MF				Norrbin, MF			Timing of diapause in relation to the onset of winter in the high-latitude copepods Pseudocalanus acuspes and Acartia longiremis	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												It is proposed that the timing of overwintering diapause in multivoltine, marine copepods is optimised as in insects and limnic copepods. Theoretical models state that resting should begin a period equivalent to 1 generation before the environment becomes unfavourable. Computer simulations and field studies have shown this to apply to insects and limnic copepods. The present paper tests and discusses the model predictions in relation to seasonal environmental changes and life history events for populations of Pseudocalanus acuspes (Giesbrecht, 1881) and Acartia longiremis T. Lilljeborg in North Norwegian fjords. These copepods switch from developing populations, with normally developing gonads, to resting populations, with immature gonads, within a few weeks in early fall. Phytoplankton abundance and primary production decline later in the fall.																	0171-8630					OCT	1996	142	1-3					99	109		10.3354/meps142099								WOS:A1996VT88800010						
J	Kauhala, K				Kauhala, K			Habitat use of raccoon dogs, Nyctereutes procyonoides, in southern Finland	ZEITSCHRIFT FUR SAUGETIERKUNDE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MAMMALIAN BIOLOGY												Habitat use of raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides) was studied in southern Finland during the snow-free seasons of 1990-1992 using radio tracking. Habitat selection within the study area and habitat use within the home range were examined. Raccoon dogs favoured shore areas especially during early summer. Shore areas with dense undergrowth provide food (e. g. frogs) and shelter, and raccoon dogs often escape into water when attacked. During autumn, raccoon dogs favoured moist heaths with abundant berries, which serve as an important food source before entering winter dormancy. The habitat use of raccoon dogs is thus affected by the availability of food, shelter and suitable den sites. Two features are common to dogs in all areas: 1) the are very often found near water and 2) during autumn they are more or less dependent on fruits and berries, which affects their habitat selection.																	0044-3468					OCT	1996	61	5					269	275										WOS:A1996VN57800002

Misted psylla had significantly greater mortality than unmisted controls. Increases in mortality occurred at temperatures as warm as -6 degrees C, a temperature well within the range of conditions in the field. At extreme low temperatures (-18 degrees C) there was virtually no mortality in the unmisted controls, whereas mortality approached or reached 100% in several of the misted groups. Temperatures necessary to kill 50% of insects estimated for topically treated psylla ranged between -2.6 and -12.7 degrees C for surfactant-treated insects, and below -18 degrees C for water-treated or control insects. The possibility of using surfactants and water for control of overwintering pear psylla is discussed.																	0008-347X					SEP-OCT	1996	128	5					825	830		10.4039/Ent128825-5								WOS:A1996VT78800004						
J	Kudoh, H; Ishiguri, Y; Kawano, S				Kudoh, H; Ishiguri, Y; Kawano, S			Phenotypic plasticity in age and size at maturity and its effects on the integrated phenotypic expressions of life history traits of Cardamine flexuosa (Cruciferae)	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY												We analyzed variation in phenotypic plasticity of life history traits between two Cardamine flexuosa populations based on differences in plasticity of age and size at maturity. C. flexuosa (Cruciferae) is a facultative, vernalization-sensitive, long-day annual, and its phenology and the phenotypic expressions of many life history traits are largely controlled by photoperiod and vernalization in natural populations. We used plants from two populations which differed in their responses to chilling and photoperiod treatments. The timing of developmental processes was changed by controlling temperature and photoperiod regimes in growth chambers. Plasticity in size at maturity was analyzed as changes in a growth trajectory using two parameters, age at maturity (Delta t) and growth rate (k). Both traits showed plasticity, but differences between the populations were found mostly for Delta t. Distinctive differences in size at maturity of individuals in the two populations were mainly due to different amounts of plasticity in Delta t. Variations in plasticity of nine other life history traits and their associations to age and size at maturity were also analyzed. Variation for eight of the traits can be described, at least in part, as a function of age and size at maturity for both populations, and most of the variation in the total number of seeds was explained by age and size at maturity. Only age at maturity had any effect on changes in resource allocation. The nine life history traits were integrated through associated character expressions with age and size at maturity. Changes in the association between a trait and age and/or size at maturity were rather conservative compared to changes in the plasticity of a trait between the two populations. Associations with age and size at maturity are mostly explicable in terms of inherent relationships in the developmental processes, and they may limit the ecological range expansion and the adaptive evolution of plasticity in C. flexuosa. The negative correlation between reproductive allocation and age at maturity can be a cost of delaying maturation in C. flexuosa.																	1010-061X	1420-9101				SEP	1996	9	5					541	570		10.1046/j.1420-9101.1996.9050541.x								WOS:A1996VJ18300002						
J	Nunes, MV; Young, S; Hardie, J				Nunes, MV; Young, S; Hardie, J			Laboratory-simulated naturally-decreasing day lengths, twilight and aphid photoperiodism	PHYSIOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												Day-length changes, as well as periods of twilight, that occur in the course of each natural day-night cycle, were recreated for two chosen latitudes in a computer-controlled 'natural-day-length simulator'. The photoperiodic responses of two aphid species, Aphis fabae and Megoura viciae, were examined in conditions which mimicked late summer to autumn at two simulated latidudes, 51.5 degrees N (e.g. Ascot, Southern Britain) and 60 degrees N (e.g. southern tip of Shetland Islands, Northern Britain), with temperatures between 16 degrees C ('night') and 18 degrees C ('day'). The responses under simulated natural photoperiodic conditions were similar to those observed under conventional experimental conditions of squarewave light-dark cycles (with abrupt Lights-on and Lights-off and constant Light intensities during the light phase): both aphid species responded to civil twilight as light, and the critical day lengths (including civil twilight) for the induction of sexual morphs by the two aphid species observed in the simulator were the same as those found in squarewave light-dark cycles. Autumn field experiments (51.5 degrees N) with the same clones of A.fabae and M.viciae revealed much longer critical day lengths for gynopara and male induction in A.fabae compared with those in the laboratory, but the same critical day length for ovipara induction in M.viciae. Minimal night temperatures in the field were on average 6 degrees C, whereas maximal day temperatures declined from around 30 degrees C in early September to 12 degrees C at the end of October; it seems that the critical day lengths in A.fabae are temperature dependent, whereas the findings for M.viciae confirm that the critical day length is temperature compensated.																	0307-6962					SEP	1996	21	3					231	241		10.1111/j.1365-3032.1996.tb00860.x								WOS:A1996VX49800011

Merrill] and 1 of wild annual soyabean (Glycine soja L.) were sown at two sites in Taiwan in 1989 and 1990 and on six occasions during 1990 at one site in Queensland, Australia, On two of the occasions in Australia additional treatments extended natural daylengths by 0.5 h and 2 h. The number of days from sowing for the first flower to appear on 50% of the plants in each treatment was recorded (f), and from these values the rate of progress towards flowering (1/f) was related to temperature and photoperiod. In photoperiod-insensitive accessions it was confirmed that the rate is linearly related to temperature at least up to about 29 degrees C, In photoperiod-sensitive genotypes this is also the case in shorter daylengths but when the critical photoperiod (P-c) is exceeded flowering is delayed, This delay increases with photoperiod until a ceiling photoperiod (P-ce) is reached. Between P-c and P-ce, 1/f is linearly related to both temperature (positive) and photoperiod (negative), but in photoperiods longer than P-ce there is no further response to either factor, The resulting triple-intersecting-plane response surface can be defined by six genetically-determined coefficients, the values of which are environment-independent but predict time to flower in any environment, and thus quantify the genotype x environment interaction, By this means the field data were used to characterise the photothermal responses of all 40 accessions, The outcome of this characterisation in conjunction with an analysis of the world-wide range of photothermal environments in which soyabean crops are grown lead to the following conclusions: (1) photoperiod-insensitivity is essential in soyabean crops in temperate latitudes, but such genotypes flower too rapidly for satisfactory yields in the tropics; (2) photoperiod-sensitivity appears to be essential to delay flowering sufficiently to allow adequate biomass accumulation in the warm climates of the tropics; (3) contrary to a widely held view, some degree of photoperiod-sensitivity is also needed in the tropics if crop-duration homeostasis is required where there is variation in sowing dates (this is achieved through a photoperiod-controlled delay in flowering which counteracts the seasonal increase in temperature that is correlated with increase in daylength); and (4) a greater degree of photoperiod-sensitivity is necessary to provide maturity-date homeostasis for variable sowing dates - a valuable attribute in regions of uncertain rainfall, Since the triple-intersecting-plane response model used here also applies to other species, the use of field data to characterise the photothermal responses of other crops is discussed briefly.

J	Takeda, M				Takeda, M			Photoperiodic induction, maintenance and termination of winter diapause in two geographic ecotypes of the rice stem maggot, Chlorops oryzae Matsumura (Diptera: Chloropidae)	APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY												The sensitivity of Chlorops oryzae MATSUMURA to photoperiod in controlling winter diapause was studied by changing photoperiod at various stages. A short day (12 h) in the egg stage induced a winter diapause in the first larval stadium. The latter half of the egg stage was most sensitive to the diapause inducing photoperiod. Short days in the larval stage maintained diapause, but long days terminated it. In the bivoltine strain (39 degrees N), three short-day cycles were required to induce diapause when the egg stage lasted for 9 days. The critical photoperiod during the egg stage for the induction of diapause was about LD14 : 10. The duration of diapause under LD 12 : 12 was 80 to 90 days. The critical photoperiod in the larval stage for the maintenance of diapause was about LD14: 10. Winter diapause in the bivoltine strain sampled in December was maintained under LD12 : 12, but short and long days had similar effects on development when insects were sampled in January. In the trivoltine strain (35 degrees N), 4 short-day cycles were required to induce diapause when the egg stage was 9 days. The critical photoperiod for the induction and maintenance of diapause at 20 degrees C was about LD13: 11. The duration of diapause under LD12 : 12 was 50 to 60 days.																	0003-6862					AUG	1996	31	3					379	388		10.1303/aez.31.379								WOS:A1996VD65600005

These localities are approximately at the same latitude (Mairinque 23 degrees 52'S and Campos do Jordao 22 degrees 45' S), but with a difference of 1000m in the altitude between them. As same latitudes ensure similar photoperiods and the difference in altitude, a persistent step in the temperature, the field work was conducted in environmental conditions varying within a known and limited range. Circadian rhythms are described for pollen and nectar harvesting behaviours, which are finely adjusted to the flower's anthesis and withering. The environmental light/dark cycle is suggested as the main zeitgeber and temperature cycle either as a secondary zeitgeber or as a masking agent. Since these bee species are non-social, the possibility of social synchonization was discarded. We concluded that temporal adaptation plays a central role in the interaction of flowers and its visitors. In addition to specialized structures to collect the pollen of L.elegans, the acrophases of pollen and nectar collection rhythms coincide with the rime when the stigma is most receptive and consequently the possibility of pollination increases highly.

The horse fed on natural pasture and a nutritionally balanced feed twice a day (11:00 and 17:00 h). Water and a mineral supplement were available ''ad libitum''. Semen was collected for over 36 months (Oct 89-Dec92) almost daily between 08:00 and 10:00 h by an artificial vagina and evaluated for volume of ejaculate, spermatozoa motility and concentration by standard procedures. Analysis of data from a total of 128-days was performed according to the Fast Fourier Transform Technique (FFT).

The adults of A. venustula emerge in summer, and are in reproductive diapause until the following spring when the main adult feeding and oviposition activity occurs. A. venustula prefers mesic shaded and transitional areas but can survive on formerly forested land. The experimental adult feeding range of the beetle is restricted to species in genus Euphorbia, while the larval feeding range is restricted to species in subgenus Esula. Within its habitat in Europe, the beetle discriminates between species in subgenus Esula.																	0931-2048					AUG	1996	120	7					405	411		10.1111/j.1439-0418.1996.tb01628.x								WOS:A1996VG89500004						
J	McWatters, HG; Saunders, DS				McWatters, HG; Saunders, DS			The influence of each parent and geographic origin on larval diapause in the blow fly, Calliphora vicina	JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY												The blow fly, Calliphora vicina R.-D. (Diptera: Calliphoridae), displays a larval diapause in response to short daylengths experienced by the adult female. The range of daylengths inducing diapause varies among geographic populations of fly and differences are genetic in origin, being maintained under laboratory conditions. The critical daylength for a southern, English strain is 14.5 hours of light and for a northern, Finnish strain is 16 hours. Crosses between these strains revealed that diapause incidence was produced entirely by maternal induction and was not influenced by the male. Diapause duration, in contrast, was affected by both parents; larvae with mothers of the northern strain and southern fathers entered diapause at the same rate as the pure bred northern larvae but emerged from it much more quickly. Thus diapause duration is a characteristic of the larvae themselves, influenced by the genetic background of both parents.

Percentage of hatch of embryonated eggs, days to Ist hatch after incubation at warm temperature and temporal distribution of hatch are used to compare hatch of different strains under various conditions. Eggs from 2 Russian gypsy moth strains required less exposure to low temperature to be able to hatch than did eggs from a North American strain. Hatch took longer to begin and proceeded more slowly in eggs held at constant 15 and 20 degrees C. Hatch did not occur for >99% of North American and Russian eggs held at a constant 25 degrees C. Substantial variation in hatch in response to low temperature exists both within and between gypsy moth strains, making adaptation to a wide range of climates possible. Variation in diapause requirements within a strain and between strains can be assessed and compared by holding eggs for 60 d at 5 degrees C followed by incubation at 25 degrees C.

These nitrogen (N) species data, in conjunction with meteorological data, N data at a 3020 m a.s.l. subalpine site, and back-trajectory information, show that over 90% of the sampling was obtained under free tropospheric but, apparently, N-enriched conditions. Seasonal concentration and estimated N dry deposition trends are presented. Dry plus wet atmospheric N loading is found to provide 2.5-3 kg N ha(-1) of new, available N to tundra plants during the growing season (mid-May to mid-September), of which 50%, or more, is dry deposited. During the eight-month, nongrowing season about 5 kg N ha(-1) is wet plus dry deposited to the aggrading snowpack or dormant tundra plants. Up to half of this nongrowing season N loading is made available to growing tundra plants during snowmelt. Thus, a total of 3-5 kg N ha(-1) is annually made available to tundra plants by atmospheric deposition of, primarily, anthropogenically derived N. This annual input of new, available N to nutrient N-limited tundra plants may be compared with the dominant pathway for plant N availability at Niwot Ridge-net mineralization of 10-12 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) recycled through the soil. The ratio of atmospheric N deposition to net N mineralization, presently approaching 0.5, is higher at the Niwot Ridge alpine tundra ecosystem than at most other ecosystems in the continental U.S.																	1352-2310					JUL	1996	30	14					2527	2537		10.1016/1352-2310(95)00463-7								WOS:A1996UK36300007

Using historical and contemporary zooplankton and fish data, sediment analysis for diapausing eggs, and experiments on predation of Gammarus lacustris on diapausing eggs of H. arcticus, we assess the fate of these populations 35 years after fish stocking. In Pipit Lake, in which the trout introduction failed within 21 years, we propose that H. arcticus recovered as a result of hatching of diapausing eggs held in the sediments. In Snowflake Lake the diapausing egg bank was exhausted prior to the loss of the fish population 25 years after first stocking and H. arcticus recovery did not occur. Experimental studies indicate that G. lacustris predation on diapausing eggs probably occurs within the sediments. Combined with a 10-fold difference in G. lacustris density between Snowflake and Pipit lakes the results of the predation experiments imply that G. lacustris had a strong negative impact on the abundance of diapausing eggs held in Snowflake Lake sediments and therefore reduced the ability of the population to recover following perturbation.

Seasonal patterns of photochemical activity and the occurrence of photosystem II inhibition	FLORA												Photosystem (PS) II fluorescence of the cyanobacterial lichen Peltigera rufescens, together with microclimate parameters (light, temperature, relative humidity, and rainfall), was recorded over a complete year (September 1992 - August 1993). Measurements were made on thalli at two quasi-natural growing sites in a xerothermic steppe formation in the Botanical Garden, Wurzburg. The sites spanned the natural habitat range for the species, one being partly shaded whilst we increased exposure at the other by removing the steppe canopy. Chlorophyll fluorescence parameters were automatically determined at 20 minute intervals using a PAM-2000 fluorometer. From the fluorescence data, metabolically active phases of the poikilohydrous lichen could clearly be distinguished from dormancy. In the majority of cases, dormancy could be attributed to desiccation. During winter, frost inhibited activity completely at temperatures below -5 degrees C. Metabolic activity of the lichen occurred over a wide range of temperatures and light conditions including periods of very high light when photoinhibitory damage might have been expected. However, values of the optimal quantum efficiency of PS II (determined under low light at dawn) showed no depression (photoinhibition) except when metabolic activity of the lichen had been severely curtailed by frost and/or extended drought. The inhibition was reversed after even brief periods of normal metabolic activity. Peltigera rufescens, therefore, seemed to be well adapted to its natural environment and showed little photoinhibition as long as it frequently hydrated and became metabolically active.

J	Koveos, DS; Veerman, A				Koveos, DS; Veerman, A			Involvement of the circadian system in photoperiodic termination of diapause in the spider mite Tetranychus urticae	JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY												In the spider mite Tetranychus urticae, both diapause induction and diapause termination are under photoperiodic control. Resonance experiments with three strains from different localities in Europe revealed the involvement of the circadian system in the photoperiodic termination of diapause. In all strains the tau-value of the rhythm involved in diapause termination appeared to be shorter than that of the rhythm involved in diapause induction. This may be caused by a change in period length of a circadian oscillator involved in both induction and termination of diapause, or it may indicate that different circadian oscillators affect diapause induction and diapause termination in the spider mite. In previous experiments it has been demonstrated that the photoperiodic clock controlling diapause termination is most probably the same as the one controlling diapause induction. In eight strains of the spider mite, originating from widely different localities in Europe, the critical nightlengths for diapause induction and diapause termination appeared to be identical. Apparently some change occurs in the circadian system between diapause induction and diapause termination, without a concurrent change in photoperiodic time measurement. This makes it unlikely that the oscillator(s) involved in diapause induction and termination would constitute the photoperiodic clock. The results are interpreted according to the so-called non-clock or resonance hypothesis for the involvement of the circadian system in photoperiodic phenomena. Temperature appeared to affect the resonance rhythm of diapause termination differently in different strains of the spider mite: in two strains the rhythm appeared to be temperature compensated, in two other strains it was not. In two strains of the spider mite, originating from the same latitude, critical nightlength appeared to be the same, whereas the period of the rhythm involved in diapause termination differed from 1-3 h among the strains, depending on temperature. These results do not provide evidence in favour of a circadian-based photoperiodic clock in T. urticae. Another effect of temperature was found on the appearance of the different resonance peaks: temperature had little effect on the time course of appearance of the first peak (at nights shorter than the critical nightlength), but subsequent peaks (at nights longer than the critical nightlength) developed faster at higher temperature. This suggests that the mechanism of diapause termination in regimes with nights shorter than the critical nightlength is different from that with nights longer than the critical nightlength. The first represents the photoperiodic response proper, controlled by the photoperiodic clock at nightlengths around the critical nightlength, whereas the latter is most probably a 'resonance' effect, revealing the influence of the circadian system on the expression of the photoperiodic response in extended nights. The above effect of temperature therefore also appears to corroborate the non-clock hypothesis for photoperiodic time measurement in the spider mite.

Bats entered daily torpor when food and water were withheld for one night and the air temperature (T-a) was below about 26 degrees C. Torpor began shortly after lights went on in the morning and lasted for a maximum of 12 hours. During torpor at T-a 18 degrees C, metabolic rates fell to a minimum of about 15% of that in resting individuals at the same T-a, and to about 40% of the basal metabolic rate. The body temperature (T-b) during torpor was metabolically defended at or above about T-b 18 degrees C. Individuals that did not enter torpor in the morning reduced their T-b from about 34.5 degrees C, observed in resting individuals that had been fed during the previous night, to values between 30.2 and 32.8 degrees C, and the resting metabolic rate fell by about 25%. The ability to undergo short periods of torpor may explain why the distribution range of S. australis extends much further south than that of other small Australian megachiropteran bats.																	0952-8369					JUL	1996	239		3				583	590		10.1111/j.1469-7998.1996.tb05944.x								WOS:A1996UY83900012						
J	Kennedy, AD				Kennedy, AD			Antarctic fellfield response to climate change: A tripartite synthesis of experimental data	OECOLOGIA												This paper explores the biological consequences of climate change by integrating the results of a tripartite investigation involving fumarole, field manipulation and laboratory incubation experiments. The geographical region for this research is the maritime Antarctic. Under contemporary climate conditions, the lithosols in this region support only a sparse cryptogamic flora of limited taxonomic diversity and low structural complexity, However, the existence in geothermal areas of temperate species (e.g. Campylopus introflexus, Marchantia polymorpha, Philonotis acicularis) growing outside their normal biogeographical range suggests that elevated temperature and humidity may alter the trajectory of community development towards Magellanic or Patagonian composition. Productivity is also likely to increase, as indicated by significantly greater vegetative biomass recorded beneath climate-ameliorating soil covers than in controls. Barren fellfield soil samples transplanted to the laboratory and incubated at temperatures of 2-25 degrees C show rapid development of moss, algae and lichen propagules in the range 15-25 degrees C. A variety of species develop that have not been recorded in the field. The presence of exotic taxa indicates the existence of a dormant propagule bank in maritime Antarctic soils and suggests that no significant delay is likely to occur between the onset of climate warming and community development: instead, rapid establishment of those species favoured by the new climate conditions will yield a distinct founder effect, with increasing above- and below-ground biomass stimulating biogeochemical cycling. It is argued that the combined results of this synthesis identify generic responses to climate change arising from the importance at high latitudes of low temperature and water availability as limiting factors: subject to other growth resources being non-limiting, a more consistent stimulatory response to climate change may be expected than in temperate or tropical regions. The tripartite approach, encompassing field, microcosm and laboratory methodologies, renders the conclusions more robust than any single study considered in isolation.																	0029-8549	1432-1939				JUL	1996	107	2					141	150		10.1007/BF00327897								WOS:A1996VA14800001	28307299					
J	Basco, PS; Rashotte, ME; Stephan, FK				Basco, PS; Rashotte, ME; Stephan, FK			Photoperiod duration and energy balance in the pigeon	PHYSIOLOGY & BEHAVIOR												Energy balance, and daily rhythms in feeding activity, body temperature (T-b), metabolic rate (O-2 consumption), and RQ (CO2/O-2) that affect that balance, were studied in pigeons when the duration of the photophase gradually lengthened (LP group) or shortened (SP group) from an initial starting point at LD 12:12. The end point of change for the LP group was LD 21:3, and for the SP group was LD 3:21. Standard laboratory conditions were in effect (moderate ambient temperature; ad lib food and water). On LD 12:12, energy balance was positive (the ratio of gross energy intake to energy expenditure approximated 1.25). In the light phase, a bimodal pattern of feeding was accompanied by elevated levels in T-b, O-2 consumption, and RQ; in the dark phase, T-b and O-2 consumption fell at lights-off, and prior to lights-on there were anticipatory rises in both measures and a drop in RQ. Energy balance was remarkably constant over a wide range of photoperiods, but at the shortest photoperiods energy balance became more positive (approximately 1.45) because energy intake increased without much change in energy expenditure. Changes in the daily rhythms of the various measures provided some bases for understanding the changes in energy balance. Analysis of the T-b rhythms indicated that the circadian system of the pigeon appears to be capable of adjusting to a wide range of photoperiods. It is suggested that the increase in energy balance at short photoperiods may occur because of inadequate feedback from nutritional and metabolic signals, or may reflect anticipatory winter seasonal adjustments triggered by photoperiod duration.																	0031-9384					JUL	1996	60	1					151	159		10.1016/0031-9384(95)02238-4								WOS:A1996UU13200023	8804656

The ecological, physiological and geographical variations in the larval siphonal index of C. pipiens (the ratio of the length of the siphon to its width at the base) was investigated using both original measurements and previously published data. In all, data were used from 259 collections from open water bodies (marshes, ditches, holes, barrels, etc.) and underground waters (house basements) in areas of Europe, Asia and part of Africa. Autogeny was studied in some cases by dissection of females. In C. pipiens the mean siphonal index was strongly correlated with ecology (water body type) and adult physiology (autogeny). In spite of high geographical and individual variation, which makes the identification of individual larvae difficult, the mean siphonal index can be used with certainty for the differentiation of populations of the two forms of C. pipiens.

Since monogenous pairs are found in orders and species phylogenetically very far from each other, in order to try and clarify this phenomenon, two geographical populations of Asellus aquaticus (Isopoda) were collected in the Netherlands and in Italy, where the duration of the cold season and the photoperiods are very different. From these parental (P) populations, 200 females and 200 males per population were randomly subsampled and bred under standard conditions of temperature and nutrition. One half of each P generation was subjected to 18 hours light per day, the other to 14 hours light per day. New-born of each pair (laboratory F1) were grown up to differentiation of external sexual characters under the same photoperiod experienced by the parents. Also, hybrid F1 generation, born from mating between the two populations, was conceived in both photoperiods, but, after birth, one half of the new-born was maintained in the same photoperiod in which they were conceived, the other half was grown under the other photoperiod. No significant difference between the sex ratios was found in the two photoperiods, neither between Italian nor between Dutch Asellus. The sex ratio of Dutch F1 is female biased, while it is male biased in Italian Asellus. The female- or male-biased sex ratio can be ascribed to the high proportion of monogenous pairs in which offspring sex ratio is significantly biased towards females (in the Dutch population) and/or in which offspring sex ratio is significantly biased towards males (in the Italian population). On the basis of these results we can rule out the influence of photoperiod in sex determination for this species. The results shown by the hybrids suggest some form of maternal inheritance. In fact, the hybrids' sex ratio as indeed the frequency of pairs breeding one sex alone, was skewed towards the same sex for which the maternal population showed a bias. We therefore consider the possibility of sex determination associated with a cytoplasmic factor (a mitochondrial DNA?), which would inactivate only one of the two sets of genes governing sex determination.																	0011-216X					JUN	1996	69		4				455	475		10.1163/156854096X01041								WOS:A1996UY39500004

The Fall Webworm, Hyphantria cunea, introduced into Japan from North America in 1945, was bivoltine until the early 1970s throughout its distribution area, but thereafter shifted to be trivoltine in south-western areas of Japan. 2. To clarify changes of life-history traits in relation to the shift in voltinism and to delineate the boundary between bi- and trivoltinism, the developmental rate and photoperiodic response controlling the induction of pupal diapause were investigated in 13 geographic populations. 3. Geographic variation in the critical photoperiod for diapause induction was not a simple dine, but shifted step-wise. The critical photoperiod was longer in populations north of 36 degrees N than in populations south of 36 degrees N, and the interpopulation variance for the critical photoperiod was small in each area. 4. The duration of the larval stage was significantly shorter in the southern populations than in the northern ones, but there was no conspicuous break point in its dine. 5. Geographic variation in pupal development followed a similar pattern to that observed for larval development, although the variation was comparatively small. 6. Thus, both critical photoperiod and developmental rate decreased when the shift in voltinism from bivoltine to trivoltine occurred as this insect expanded its range. The transitional zone between bi- and trivoltinism was around 36 degrees N.																	0269-8463					JUN	1996	10	3					384	389		10.2307/2390287								WOS:A1996VH86100011

There has been little exploration, however, of within species Wolbachia polymorphisms and their effects on compatibility. Here we show that some strains of the parasitic wasp Nasonia vitripennis are infected with two distinct bacterial strains (A and B) whereas others are singly infected (A or B). Double and single infections are confirmed by both PCR amplification and Southern analysis of genomic DNA. Furthermore, it is shown that prolonged larval diapause (the overwintering stage of the wasp) of a double-infected strain can lead to stochastic loss of one or both bacterial strains. After diapause of a double-infected line, sublines were produced with AB, A only, B only or no Wolbachia. A and B sublines are bidirectionally incompatible, whereas males from AB lines are unidirectionally incompatible with females of A and B sublines. Results therefore show rapid development of bidirectional incompatibility within a species due to segregation of associated symbiotic bacteria.

J	Husband, BC; Barrett, SCH				Husband, BC; Barrett, SCH			A metapopulation perspective in plant population biology	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 A metapopulation approach considers the ecology and genetics of populations as a product of local dynamics and the regional processes of migration, extinction and colonization. While conventional metapopulation theory involves species with frequent population turnover, limited migration and random extinction, it is likely that metapopulation dynamics, broadly defined as the product of local population dynamics and dispersal, is a feature of all species. 2 Theoretical metapopulation models of single species make three critical insights. First, metapopulations will consist of a shifting mosaic of local populations linked through migration with only a fraction of the available habitat patches occupied at one time. Secondly, there is a threshold number of habitats available, below which the species cannot persist because extinction exceeds colonization. Thirdly, the antagonism between selective forces acting during recolonization and population growth can influence the evolution of phenotypic traits. Unfortunately, little empirical data is available to evaluate these ideas for plants or to address the broader issue of whether processes at a regional scale add anything to our understanding of population dynamics. 3 Plants may seem particularly appropriate for metapopulation analyses as a result of their immobility, strong spatial structure and restricted dispersal. However, a review of the literature revealed a paucity of studies that explicitly adopted a metapopulation approach, particularly in terms of testing theoretical models. We argue that this is because of the difficulty of measuring parameters such as extinction, colonization and migration that are central to most metapopulation models. 4 Plants possess a number of special features that present both challenges and opportunities for the development of new insights into the biology of metapopulations. Three particular characteristics, seed dormancy, restricted dispersal and local adaptation, need to be incorporated into existing theoretical models so they more accurately reflect the dynamics of plant metapopulations. Finally, more effort is needed to incorporate the explicit spatial structure of individuals within metapopulations and to investigate the effect that dispersion has on their growth and reproduction.

(Bistorta vivipara [L.] S.F. Gray) intermediate to high levels of genetic diversity were detected. In lowland populations in the Alps, which are outside of the typical ecological range of P. viviparum, none or very little genetic variability was found. Most genotypes were restricted to one or a few populations. High arctic, subarctic, and alpine populations had no genotype in common. Plants from Scandinavia needed considerably longer photoperiods for floral induction than plants from lower latitudes (Alps). The Scandinavian plants proved to be genetically adapted to the long, continuous daylight in summer at high latitudes. Stem length differences of lowland and highland clones of the Alps persisted under identical conditions in culture. Polygonum viviparum reproduces almost exclusively asexually by bulbils, but the development of seeds can occasionally be observed even in arctic and alpine populations. The differentiation of ecotypes and medium to high levels of genetic diversity in arctic and alpine populations is thought to be the result of occasional sexual reproduction.																	0004-0851					MAY	1996	28	2					190	195		10.2307/1551759								WOS:A1996UN84300007

The mean supercooling points show seasonal changes, with the lowest temperatures in November/December. The nymphs usually survived freezing at temperatures a few degrees beyond the supercooling point in dry and wet environments. Thus, Pristiphora abietina nymphs appear to be tolerant to freezing, as well as to inoculative freezing. Because the cocoon is permeable to water it does not protect the nymphs from superficial wetting. The cocoons represent an efficient shelter against transpiration, but even naked nymphs lose water very slowly in dry air. Therefore, a negative correlation between sensitivity to desiccation and tolerance to inoculative freezing is presumed. Physiological and ecological aspects of this feature are discussed within the context of hibernation.																	0931-2048	1439-0418				MAY	1996	120	4					225	230		10.1111/j.1439-0418.1996.tb01595.x								WOS:A1996UM38500006						
J	Gutterman, Y				Gutterman, Y			Temperatures during storage, light and wetting affecting caryopses germinability of Schismus arabicus, a common desert annual grass	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												The common desert annual grass Schismus arabicus produces many tiny caryopses which germinate only after dry storage at high summer temperatures. Two years after maturation 24% germinated within 22 h in the dark at 20 degrees C. At 20 degrees C or lower in light, there was less germination than in dark, although not at 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C. The lower the temperature, within the range 5-15 degrees C, the longer the delay in the start of germination and the lower the levels of germination in light and dark. In alternating summer temperatures of 18 h at 20 degrees C and 6 h at 40 degrees C, the percentage of germination was higher (53%) than in winter temperatures of 18h at 15 degrees C and 6h at 5 degrees C (40%). The ecological importance of germination regulated by post-maturation dry storage duration and temperatures, and temperatures during wetting, under light or dark, is discussed.

Levels of peptides in ganglia used for purification were enhanced by manipulating their exposure to the steroid molting hormones. Explants of ganglia were cultured in the low-level ecdysteroid environment of diapausing pupae shown previously to evoke accumulation of FMRFamide-like immunoreactivity (FLI). Sufficient material for sequencing was obtained from 180 explanted ganglia. Extracts of ganglia were fractionated using two reverse-phase liquid chromatography procedures, and the immunoreactive fractions were subjected to sequence analysis using electrospray mass spectrometry. The sequences of the two peptides were determined to be GNSFLRFamide and DPSFLRFamide. These peptides have been named MasFLRFamide II and MasFLRFamide III, respectively; the previously characterized M. sexta FLRFamide (pEDVVHSFLRFamide) has been renamed MasFLRFamide I. The three peptides show distinctive tissue and developmental distributions as determined from fractionated extracts of larval and adult central nervous system structures and neurohemal organs. In the retrocerebral corpora cardiaca/corpora allata, MasFLRFamide I was the predominant form, while in the segmental ganglia MasFLRFamides II and III predominated. Higher levels of MasFLRFamide I and II were found in the adult, whereas there was little apparent change in the level of MasFLRFamide III upon metamorphosis. Determinations of peptide levels in fractionated hemolymph of newly emerged moths revealed that levels of MasFLRFamide I and III could exceed 10 nmol l(-1). The actions of the three peptides were tested on the moth ileum, MasFLRFamides II and III were found to be stimulatory. At 1 nmol l(-1), these peptides induced robust increases in the rate of rhythmic longitudinal and peristaltic waves of contractions. In contrast, MasFLRFamide I was ineffective even at 20 nmol l(-1). Thus, while all three peptides have the characteristics of neurohormones in M. sexta, the physiological findings show that the heptapeptide FLRFamides have properties distinct from those of the decapeptide.

Stranding records of neonatal dolphins and observed births from a long-term field study were used to estimate peak periods of birth for wild populations, and information from captive-breeding colonies was used to assess the effects of latitude and origin of breeding females on timing of birth for dolphins in captivity. Bottlenose dolphins showed diffuse peaks and considerable flexibility in their seasonality of reproduction. There was no relationship between latitude and seasonality of reproduction or synchrony of births. However, there was a correlation between origin of population and seasonality of reproduction in both wild and captive dolphins. We suggest that adaptations to local environmental conditions have the strongest influence on seasonality of reproduction in these populations of bottlenose dolphins.																	0022-2372					MAY	1996	77	2					394	403		10.2307/1382814								WOS:A1996UM56200013						
J	Zadereev, ES; Gubanov, VG				Zadereev, ES; Gubanov, VG			The role of population density in gamogenesis induction in Moina macrocopa (Cladocera: Crustacea)	ZHURNAL OBSHCHEI BIOLOGII												Combined influence of population density, temperature and photoperiod on the gamogenesis of individual females of M. macrocopa was investigated. In all experiments the influence of population density was associated with the direct effect of ''swarm water''. The photoperiod in its broad natural range also influences gamogenesis induction. The increase in temperature above optimum but lower than lethal level sharply decreases the efficiency of gamogenesis. In this case stimulation of gamogenesis is possible by combined effect of poor feeding and high population density. If temperature and photoperiod are optimum for partenogenetic population the change of reproduction mode in low-density population of M. macrocopa is determined by poor feeding white in high-density populations density itself is more important. However the increase in food concentration descreases the efficiency of ''swarm water'' on the gamogenesis induction. According to the hypothesis of nondirect influence of population density an individual decreases its filtarion rate (and starves) under ''swarm water'' condition.

J	Austin, ABM; Tatchell, GM; Harrington, R; Bale, JS				Austin, ABM; Tatchell, GM; Harrington, R; Bale, JS			Adaptive significance of changes in morph production during the transition from parthenogenetic to sexual reproduction in the aphid Rhopalosiphum padi (Homoptera: Aphididae)	BULLETIN OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH												Many aphid species have life cycles which alternate between asexual reproduction during spring and summer and sexual reproduction in autumn. This paper describes the sequences of morphs produced by clones of Rhopalosiphum padi (Linnaeus) in response to a range of photoperiods and temperatures in the laboratory, and under semi-natural conditions at the time of year when the transition from parthenogenetic to sexual reproduction occurs. By using similarities in the order in which the various morphs were born, clones of R. padi were found to produce eight progeny sequence types. A clone of X. padi will produce these sequence types sequentially as it changes from parthenogenetic to fully sexual reproduction. The progeny sequence produced by clones under conditions corresponding to those of spring and summer consist of parthenogenetic females only. During late summer, production of parthenogenetic females is followed by males. Later in the year, a clone produces progeny sequences consisting of parthenogenetic females, gynoparae and males. The asexual phase of reproduction is terminated in late autumn when only gynoparae and males are born. A minority of clones terminate parthenogenetic reproduction by producing only gynoparae. The function of these changes in progeny sequence in maximizing the reproductive success of a clone of X. padi is discussed.																	0007-4853	1475-2670				APR	1996	86	2					93	99		10.1017/S0007485300052317								WOS:A1996UE24400001						
J	Orr, MR				Orr, MR			Life-history adaptation and reproductive isolation in a grasshopper hybrid zone	EVOLUTION												Patterns of life-history adaptation and reproductive isolation were investigated in the acridid grasshoppers Melanoplus sanguinipes and M. devastator, which hybridize along an altitudinal gradient in the Sierra Nevada of California. Melanoplus sanguinipes females crossed with M. devastator males produced eggs that were approximately half as viable as eggs from other crosses. Diminished viability was not attributable either to infection by Wolbachia pipientis or to failure of sperm transfer. When offered an opportunity to choose a mate, females from all populations discriminated against males of the other species, whereas in no-choice tests measuring copulation duration only females from the tails of the dines showed preferences. Melanoplus sanguinipes, found at high elevations where the growing season is short, exhibited faster egg hatch, faster larval development, smaller adult body sizes, and smaller clutch sizes than M. devastator. Melanoplus devastator, from California's Central Valley, endured a hot and dry summer in a reproductive diapause that was absent in M. sanguinipes. Clines in reproductive diapause and clutch size coincided with the region of reproductive incompatibility. Development time, body size, and hatch time also changed across the hybrid zone, but the regions of largest transitions in these traits were either difficult to locate using the limited populations studied here or were not coincident with the zone's center. A method is described for combining ecological and phylogenetic analyses to address the unknown issue of whether life-history divergence has conributed to reproductive isolation in this system.

J	Tanaka, K				Tanaka, K			Seasonal and latitudinal variation in supercooling ability of the house spider, Achaearanea tepidariorum (Araneae: Theridiidae)	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												1. To elucidate the impact of winter climates on supercooling in arthropod species, seasonal patterns of supercooling in a chill-tolerant spider, Achaearanea tepidariorum, were compared, from six populations in different climates (from 26 degrees 12'N to 43 degrees 03'N) in Japan. 2. The summer supercooling point (SCP) was stable at around -8 degrees C over the geographical range, while the winter SCP tended to be lower at higher latitudes. This was caused by the proportional increase of spiders with lowered SCPs at the higher latitudes. 3. SCP was closely related to the feeding status of individuals: the northern spiders with low SCP ceased to feed in winter, while the southern spiders with high SCP fed actively throughout the year. 4. Cessation of feeding and SCP depression were components of the diapause syndrome for the cool-temperate spiders, but these components were independent of diapause in the subtropical spiders. 5. These observations indicate that latitudinal variation in winter SCP is the result of genetic differentiation among populations and the connection of SCP depression with diapause may have evolved secondarily as spiders expanded from the subtropical to the temperate zone.																	0269-8463					APR	1996	10	2					185	192		10.2307/2389842								WOS:A1996UV19200004						
J	Gahr, M; Kosar, E				Gahr, M; Kosar, E			Identification, distribution, and developmental changes of a melatonin binding site in the song control system of the zebra finch	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE NEUROLOGY												In many avian species, singing is a circadian or seasonal behavior that appears to be widely dependent on gonadal steroid hormones. To explore the possibility of a further hormone-dependent vocal control mechanism driven by the action of melatonin, we examined the binding of iodinated melatonin (IMEL) in the vocal control network of adult and juvenile (22- and 40-day-old) zebra finches. IMEL binding areas of the zebra finch brain were localized and characterized by using quantitative in vitro autoradiography. In the vocal control system, dense IMEL binding site; were restricted to the nucleus hyperstriatalis ventrale, pars caudalis (HVC). The binding of IMEL to the HVC and to visual areas, e.g., the ectostriatum and the optic tectum, was saturable and showed a single class of high-affinity binding sites with binding affinities (K(d)s) in the range of 5-20 pM. Competition experiments with various indols and IMEL showed that the I:MEL binding site in the zebra finch brain has properties similar to the high-affinity melatonin receptor described in the chicken, in the house sparrow, and in the mammalian brain and retina. Similar to the zebra finch HVC, the HVC of other songbirds, e.g., male canaries and male house sparrows, has the most intense IMEL binding of all areas of the vocal control network. The IMEL binding in the forebrain vocal control areas of the zebra finch, but not that in the visual processing areas, was sexually dimorphic in correlation with the sexually dimorphic: neuroanatomy of the forebrain vocal control areas. In the HVC, there is a developmental increase in the maximal number of binding sites for IMEL and in the protein content, so that the adult phenotype of dense IMEL binding develops between day 40 and day 80. The distribution and developmental pattern of IMEL binding in the song system suggests that melatonin has a role in the motor control of singing. Melatonin binding sites in HVC could link HVC-based song control to circadian and circannual changes in the photoperiod independent of gonadal steroids.

Mean hatching time continually decreased with each successive transfer date and was significantly shorter for eggs transferred on 1 March compared with any previous transfer date. Transfer date also had a significant effect on percentage hatch, which generally increased with longer exposure of eggs to outdoor conditions. Mean hatching time was longer under 10L:14D photoperiod than at 13L:11D or 16L:8D conditions at all three temperatures studied. Rate of postdiapause development was linearly related to constant temperatures in the range from 6 to 25 degrees C, but appeared to have deviated from linearity at 30 degrees C. The lower threshold temperature for postdiapause development of eggs was estimated to be 3.4 degrees C. Means of 60, 77, and 97 degree-days above a lower threshold of 3.5 degrees C were required for hatching of the 10th, median, and 90th percentile of eggs under laboratory conditions, respectively. In each of 3 years, eclosion of first-instar larvae occurred over a 10- to 17-day period in late April to mid-May. Degree-day accumulations based on litter temperatures in the field predicted the dates of 10th, 50th and 90th percentile eclosion of first-instar larvae within +/-2 days of the observed dates.																	0008-347X					MAR-APR	1996	128	2					187	198		10.4039/Ent128187-2								WOS:A1996UL46300003

In the wild, females perform only one brood (in May). In contrast to isopods submitted to temperate climates (long day species), H. reaumuri is unsensitive to photoperiod. Onset of reproduction is dependent on temperature: it occurs only when temperature is higher than 15 degrees C (between 15 degrees C and 20 degrees C). Moreover, at 25 degrees C, the lag time of the onset of reproduction is shortened by 50% in comparison with the delay obtained at 20 degrees C. Whereas an isolated female remains in sexual rest, the presence of a male (even separated from the female by a wire netting) speeds up vitellogenesis following by moult. The beginning of burrow digging is well correlated with the initiation of reproduction (second phase of vitellogenesis).																	0011-216X					MAR	1996	69		2				223	235		10.1163/156854096X00538								WOS:A1996UL45900008

The models are integrodifference equations, discrete in time and continuous in space, and have applications to annual and perennial species. The spread or invasion of a single plant species into a geographic region is investigated by studying the travelling wave solutions of these equations. Travelling wave solutions are shown to exist in the single-species models and are compared numerically. The asymptotic wave speed is calculated for various parameter values. The single-species integrodifference equations are extended to a model for two competing annual plants. Competition in the two-species model is based on a difference equation model developed by Fakes and Mailer [26]. The two-species model with competition and dispersal yields a system of integrodifference equations. The effects of competition on the travelling wave solutions of invading plant species is investigated numerically.																	0303-6812					MAR	1996	34	4					455	481										WOS:A1996TZ31400004						
J	Houpt, TA; Boulos, Z; MooreEde, MC				Houpt, TA; Boulos, Z; MooreEde, MC			MidnightSun: Software for determining light exposure and phase-shifting schedules during global travel	PHYSIOLOGY & BEHAVIOR												The application of circadian principles has the potential to alleviate jet-lag in global travelers, but their application is hampered by the difficulty of determining light exposure along international flight routes. Computerized tools can solve this problem algorithmically. We have developed a program for Macintosh computers, called MidnightSun, which allows researchers to display ambient lighting conditions at any geographical location at any time of the year. The program contains a data base with the latitudes and longitudes of over 3000 airports. It calculates flight paths and durations, and prints a graphical itinerary indicating times of daylight during flights and layovers. Given a travel itinerary and a user-defined phase response curve (PRC) for light, it recommends light exposure times that may accelerate the reentrainment of circadian rhythms to new time zones and reduce the deleterious effects of jet-lag (depending on the efficacy of the PRC and the compliance of the traveler). Other potential applications include determining lighting protocols for photoperiodism experiments and providing data sets for mathematical circadian simulations under naturalistic lighting conditions.

J	Baskin, CC; Chester, EW; Baskin, JM				Baskin, CC; Chester, EW; Baskin, JM			Effect of flooding on annual dormancy cycles in buried seeds of two wetland Carex species	WETLANDS												Buried seeds of Carer comosa and C. stricta were exposed to nonflooded and flooded conditions and natural seasonal temperature changes for 30.5 and 33 mo, respectively. At 1-, 2- or 6-mo intervals, exhumed seeds were tested for germination in light and darkness over a range of daily thermoperiods. Freshly-matured seeds of both species were conditionally dormant; maximum germination was at 35/20 degrees C, in light. Dormancy decreased in nonflooded and flooded seeds of C, comosa during late autumn and winter but the decrease was greater in flooded than in nonflooded seeds. Nonflooded and flooded seeds of C, stricta gained the ability to germinate in light during the first summer of burial and in darkness during the following winter. Seeds of neither species germinated while they were buried in pots of soil under either nonflooded or flooded conditions in the nonheated greenhouse. Nonflooded and flooded seeds of both species incubated in light and flooded seeds of C. comosa incubated in darkness had an annual conditional dormancy/nondormancy cycle, being conditionally dormant in summer and autumn and nondormant in spring. However, nonflooded seeds of C comosa incubated in darkness remained dormant, germinating to only 1%. Most nonflooded and flooded seeds of C stricta incubated in darkness had an annual dormancy/nondormancy cycle, being dormant in summer and nondormant in spring. Thus, flooding influenced the annual changes in dormancy states of buried seeds of C. comosa, but it had no effect on seeds of C. stricta.																	0277-5212					MAR	1996	16	1					84	88		10.1007/BF03160648								WOS:A1996UD99800009						
J	Collier, RH; Finch, S				Collier, RH; Finch, S			Field and laboratory studies on the effects of temperature on the development of the carrot fly (Psila rosae F)	ANNALS OF APPLIED BIOLOGY												The thermal requirements for the pre-oviposition period, egg, larval, pupal and adult stages of the carrot fly were measured under held conditions and at a range of constant temperatures in the laboratory. In the laboratory, the pre-oviposition period lasted from 4 days at 24 degrees C to 28 days at 9 degrees C. In general, female carrot flies laid about 20-40 eggs in each batch. Once the first eggs had been laid, subsequent batches were laid after an average of 3 days at 24 degrees C to 7 days at 11.5 degrees C. The numbers of days required for egg, larval and pupal development ranged from 5, 31 and 24 days respectively at 21.5 degrees C to 25, 145 and 84 days respectively at 9 degrees C. Under laboratory conditions, complete development from egg to adult required from 60 days at 21.5 degrees C to 254 days at 9 degrees C. Newly-formed carrot fly pupae were exposed to temperatures of 22-30 degrees C for various 5-10 day periods during pupal development. Exposure to temperatures of 24 degrees C and 26 degrees C caused some, and exposure to 28 degrees C and 30 degrees C caused all, of the pupae to delay development. Pupae were sensitive to high temperatures only for approximately 4-10 days after pupation. Under field conditions between mid-May and early September, full carrot fly development (egg-adult) took 84-100 days. The numbers of day-degrees required (base temperatures of 2 degrees C and 4 degrees C) for carrot fly development in the laboratory and in the field were similar for egg hatching but not for the preoviposition period or for egg-adult development. The thermal requirement for fly development in the field varied between inoculation dates, fewest day-degrees being required when development was rapid.																	0003-4746					FEB	1996	128	1					1	11		10.1111/j.1744-7348.1996.tb07084.x								WOS:A1996VG07500001						
J	Scriber, JM; Hagen, RH; Lederhouse, RC				Scriber, JM; Hagen, RH; Lederhouse, RC			Genetics of mimicry in the tiger swallowtail butterflies, Papilio glaucus and P-canadensis (lepidoptera: Papilionidae)	EVOLUTION												The tiger swallowtail butterfly, Papilio glaucus, exhibits a female-limited polymorphism for Batesian mimicry; the Canadian tiger swallowtail, Papilio canadensis, lacks the mimetic (dark) form entirely. The species hybridize to a limited extent where their ranges overlap. Field collections and censuses indicate that mimetic females occur throughout the range of P. glaucus but at lowest frequencies in populations at the latitudinal edges of its geographic range such as the southernmost part of Florida and along the entire northern edge of its distribution from Massachusetts to Minnesota. Frequencies of mimetic females have remained relatively stable over time. Inheritance of the mimetic form is controlled primarily by two interacting sex-linked loci. The typical matrilineal pattern of inheritance in P. glaucus can be explained by polymorphism at a Y-linked locus, b. Analysis of P. glaucus X P. canadensis crosses has also revealed an X-linked locus, s, which controls the expression of the mimetic phenotype. The P. canadensis allele, s(can), suppresses the mimetic phenotype in hybrid and backcross females. Results from more than 12 yr of rearing tiger swallowtails, including interspecies hybrids, indicate that the absence of mimetic P. canadensis females is due to both a high frequency of the ''suppressing'' allele s(can) and low frequency of the black-pigment-determining b+ allele. The frequency of s(can) (or other suppressing alleles of s) in P. glaucus populations outside the hybrid zone is low. Some males heterozygous at the s locus and some suppressed mimetic females occur within the hybrid zone. A simple genetic model predicts the frequency of daughters that differ in phenotype from their mothers.																	0014-3820	1558-5646				FEB	1996	50	1					222	236		10.2307/2410795								WOS:A1996TX89100021	28568864					
J	Zwick, P				Zwick, P			Variable egg development of Dinocras spp (Plecoptera, Perlidae) and the stonefly seed bank theory	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Temperature dependence of egg development of Dinocras cephalotes (Curtis) (three German and one Norwegian population) and Slovenian D. megacephala (Klapalek) was studied under a constant 14:10 light:dark photoperiod and constant temperature ranges of 4-24 degrees C and 4-18 degrees C, respectively. D. cephalotes was also incubated under seasonal field conditions; natural daylength and fluctuating temperatures had no modifying effect. 2. Both species have very similar lower threshold temperatures (4 and 3.5 degrees C, respectively), thermal demand for development (c. 600 degree days) and high dependence of mean incubation period on temperature (exponents of regressions near 1.5). Present data on D. cephalotes agree with the literature on British and Norwegian material of the same species. 3. Development occurs only at cue temperatures above the lower threshold. Cue temperatures range from 6 degrees C (some D. megacephala) to 14 degrees C (some D, cephalotes) and vary strongly within and between egg masses of D. cephalotes. Variation is not random, but seems to be genetically determined. 4. The variable temperature response renders study of effects of particular experimental regimes, and comparisons between local populations, difficult. 5. A latitudinal gradient in cue temperatures for development from 6 degrees C at c. 46 degrees N to 12 or even 14 degrees C at c. 61 degrees N seems to reflect reduced diversity at high latitudes. 6. Average success of spontaneous hatching exceeded 90% between 12 and 20 degrees C, but declined towards higher and lower temperatures. 7. Unhatched eggs were not dead but in parapause; development at other, higher or lower, temperatures was induced. Spontaneous plus induced hatching success approached 90%. Developing eggs rarely died; most dead eggs were apparently unfertilized. 8. Dormant plecopteran eggs are proposed to form a seed bank in stream bed sediments. Highly successful development after up to 220 days of dormancy was ascertained in Dinocras, and survival for up to 3 years is reported for other Perloidea. 9. Only systellognathan egg morphology provides options for long dormancy; the other plecopteran superfamilies, notably Nemouroidea, follow different strategies.																	0046-5070					FEB	1996	35	1					81	99		10.1046/j.1365-2427.1996.00482.x								WOS:A1996TW36600008						
J	Oxford, GS; Crawford, TJ; Pernyes, K				Oxford, GS; Crawford, TJ; Pernyes, K			Why are capitulum morphs associated with other characters in natural populations of Senecio vulgaris (groundsel)?	HEREDITY												The capitulum polymorphism in Senecio vulgaris (groundsel) has previously been shown to have arisen in Britain following hybridization with the introduced species S. squalidus (Oxford ragwort). In natural populations, suites of developmental, morphological, reproductive and electrophoretic characters are often found to be associated with the radiate and non-radiate capitulum morphs. Here we demonstrate that the reasons for these character associations may vary among different populations. In plants from Acomb and Morpeth, there is no evidence of genetic linkage between the capitulum locus and those controlling a range of other characters. It is suggested that the associations between characters in these populations are a result of very low outcrossing rates between the two capitulum morphs so that chance associations present in founder individuals are not dispersed. In a population from York, however, linkage is shown to be present and provides an adequate mechanism to explain most of the character associations. York radiate plants may represent the product of a recent introgressive event involving S. squalidus. On the basis of linear discriminant function scores, in all three populations, both radiate and non-radiate progeny in the F-2 generation from crosses derived from radiate female parents are shown to be more radiate-like than equivalent progeny derived from the reciprocals with non-radiate female parents. The reason for this bias is not clear.																	0018-067X					FEB	1996	76		2				192	197		10.1038/hdy.1996.27								WOS:A1996TU59400011

Despite conflicting reports, efficient endogenous ice nucleators have not been identified in this freeze-tolerant insect. We found large crystalloid spheres within the Malpighian tubules of overwintering larvae. Energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis and infrared spectroscopy indicated that the spherules were a hydrate of tribasic calcium phosphate, To test for ice-nucleating activity, we placed the calcium phosphate spherules in 10 mu l of Schneider's insect medium and cooled them in a refrigerated bath. The addition of spherules increased the crystallization temperature of Schneider's medium by approximately 8 degrees C, from -18.4+/-0.8 degrees C to -10.1+/-0.9 degrees C (mean +/- S.E.M., N=20). Ice-nucleating activity (-10.1+/-0.9+/-0.9 degrees C) was also demonstrated in fat body cells suspended in 10 mu l of Schneider's medium. Both calcium phosphate spherules and fat body cells have ice-nucleating activity sufficiently high to explain whole-body crystallization temperatures. Furthermore, other crystalloid deposits, commonly found in diapausing or overwintering insects, also exhibited significant ice-nucleating activity. These endogenous crystalloid deposits represent a new class of heterogeneous ice nucleators that potentially regulate supercooling and promote freeze tolerance in E. solidaginis and possibly in other overwintering insects.																	0022-0949	1477-9145				FEB	1996	199	2					465	471										WOS:A1996TU98300022

On average, pregnancy lasted 359 days, with a range of 340-390 days, representing 20% of the period of post-implantation fetal growth. Pregnancy was longest and birth dates latest in years associated with reduced availability of food. Sex of fetus and birth mass had no effect on the duration of pregnancy or date of birth. However, dates of parturition tended to be consistent within individuals.																	0022-2372					FEB	1996	77	1					124	133		10.2307/1382714								WOS:A1996TW08600011

Non-invasive protocols are recommended in the field in order not to introduce additional variables. We propose an alternative strategy here. The effect of environmental cycles on biological rhythms can be estimated when the observations are made in more than one area. The areas under study must have at least one characteristic in common which is a guarantee that the limits of oscillation of an environmental cycle will be similar. This proposal has been tested using the biological system consisting of an Onagraceae plant, Ludwigia elegans, and its bee visitors, which is found in two localities at the same latitude, but at different altitudes. Under the same photoperiod, but with the mean temperature ranging within known limits, it was possible to determine temporal characteristics of the system in the field by examining the effects of the light/dark and temperature daily cycles.

(Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae), was investigated under a series of stationary photoperiods and constant temperature. When the parasitic larval stages of C. melanoscela were exposed to different photoperiods, the insect exhibited a typical long-day response: long days (greater than 18 h) promoted continuous development whereas short days (less than 16 h) resulted in diapause in the cocooned prepupal stage. Within the region of the critical photoperiod (16-18 h) the diapause response was associated with larval development time. Individuals that developed more slowly were more likely to enter diapause. Cotesia melanoscela was sensitive to photoperiod throughout its entire larval period. These individual responses are used to interpret patterns of seasonality of the parasitoid in Ontario and to compare with published information from populations of C. melanoscela in New England.																	0008-347X					JAN-FEB	1996	128	1					41	46		10.4039/Ent12841-1								WOS:A1996UB35200004

Repeated measurements of three variables in the semen were made for 36 months (Jan/90-Dec/92) in a 21-year old ''Mangalarga'' stallion living under natural photoperiod and temperature conditions in a farm situated in Sao Jose do Rio Pardo, Sao Paulo, Brazil (latitude 21 degrees 36' S; longitude 46 degrees 53' W). The horse fed on natural pasture and a nutritionally balanced feed twice a day (11:00 and 17:00 h). Water and a mineral supplement were available ad libitum. Semen was collected almost daily by an artificial vagina and showed annual changes in volume of ejaculate, sperm motility, and sperm concentration. Spectral and rhythmometric analyses of the semen data were performed according to the fast Fourier transform (FFT) and cosinor techniques (tau=365 days). Statistically significant annual rhythms for semen volume, motility, and concentration of sperm were present.

ENTOMOLOGIA GENERALIS												Two slope profiles covering altidudes from 620 - 1.420 mNN and exposed to N and S, respectively, were investigated during 2 seasons for their thermal conditions regarding the development of spruce bark beetle populations. Temperature of air and cambium in different positions on trap trees were recorded continously, in order to calculate the thermal sums available for the broods under different site and weather conditions. Moreover, flight activity and brood development was observed. In the laboratory the developmental zero and the required thermal sum of Ips typographus (Linnaeus 1758), Ips amitinus (Eichhoff 1871) and Pityogenes chalcographus (Linnaeus 1761) were experimentally determined. Significant differences between the 3 species were found. Since the data from laboratory proved to be valid also in the field, they can be used for calculating the developmental potential of these Scolytidae species under different thermal conditions. The latter differed considerably due to altitude, exposition, shadowing and weather, thus providing a wide range of different thermal sums available to the broods. Taking into account that Ips typographus cannot hibernate in a subadult stage, the effective period of reproduction during season varies between a few weeks in spring and a few months in summer. The implications for population dynamics of Ips typographus and Pityogenes chalcographus are briefly discussed, considering a diapause of adults with Ips typographus and the differences between specific modes of hibernation.																	0171-8177						1996	21	1-2					37	54										WOS:A1996VP87400004						
J	Masaki, S				Masaki, S			Geographical variation of life cycle in crickets (Ensifera: Grylloidea)	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY					2nd European Workshop of Invertebrate Ecophysiology	SEP 10-15, 1995	CESKE BUDEJOVICE, CZECH REPUBLIC	Czech Acad Sci, Inst Entomol, Univ S Bohemia, Fac Biol Sci				Crickets are convenient systems for studying life-cycle evolution. They show a considerable diversity in life-cycle types, being homodynamic in some parts of the tropics and heterodynamic with various kinds of diapause and other regulatory responses in the temperate region. Crickets are relatively free from constraints by food supply, because they are omnivorous. Therefore, their geographical variation may clearly reflect climatic selection as exemplified by latitudinal dines in adult size, egg size and ovipositor length. These morphometric dines are closely related to development time, egg diapause and photoperiodic responses, indicating that crickets are highly variable within the framework of their species-specific patterns of life cycle. More fundamental variation is divergence in life-cycle pattern that may be associated with speciation, because closely related species are often different in their life-cycle patterns (e.g., homodynamic versus heterodynamic, or egg overwintering versus larval overwintering). Evolutionary flexibility of life-cycle traits may be assessed by studying cricket populations under special natural or artificial conditions. In Japan, a population of the nemobiine cricket (Dianemobius mikado) introduced from a temperate to a subtropical island has almost lost egg diapause presumably in the last 130 years. At volcanic geothermal spots in the northern island (Hokkaido), presumptive relict populations of the nemobiine species Dianemobius nigrofasciatus occur and sing in mid-winter, but this cricket retains the photoperiodic response of a southern bivoltine type. In the subtropical nemobiine D. fascipes, artificial selection has been effective in changing the incidence and depth of diapause, and strains comparable to the tropical and temperate forms were established. The responsiveness to photoperiod in wing-form determination was also remarkably changed by selection, but this change was not associated with a change in critical photoperiod. Alternated selection in the opposite directions at photoperiods above and below the critical value to be selected was necessary to shift the critical photoperiod.																	1802-8829						1996	93	3					281	302										WOS:A1996VN62700002						
J	Whittaker, JB; Tribe, NP				Whittaker, JB; Tribe, NP			An altitudinal transect as an indicator of responses of a spittlebug (Auchenorrhyncha: Cercopidae) to climate change	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY					2nd European Workshop of Invertebrate Ecophysiology	SEP 10-15, 1995	CESKE BUDEJOVICE, CZECH REPUBLIC	Czech Acad Sci, Inst Entomol, Univ S Bohemia, Fac Biol Sci				A projected global temperature rise of 2-3 degrees C can be represented by the change in mean annual temperature experienced over some 10 degrees of latitude or approximately 700 m of altitude in the hills of northern Britain. Using an altitudinal rather than latitudinal transect has the advantage of allowing studies of population dynamics and adaptation of life cycles at the centre and edge of a species' range within the same locality with similar vegetation and photoperiod. Because of their unusual visibility in spittle masses, spittlebugs offer unusual opportunities to study population change in relation to environmental variables, including climate change. A population of spittlebugs, Neophilaenus lineatus (Auchenorrhyncha: Cercopidae) has been studied for 10 years on a transect from 20 m to 974 m on Ben Lomond, Scotland. The time lag in larval development corresponding with a 2-3 degrees C shift in mean temperature is approximately 3 weeks. Much of this arises from a delay in hatching times. There is a significant relationship between the weather in March to July (which spans hatching and early larval development) and the maximum altitude at which larvae are found in the same year. The study suggests that insects with a similar life cycle to Neophilaenus lineatus will respond to a 2 degrees C rise in mean temperature by extending their range and completing the life cycle two to three weeks earlier.																	1210-5759						1996	93	3					319	324										WOS:A1996VN62700005						
J	Block, W				Block, W			Cold or drought - The lesser of two evils for terrestrial arthropods?	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY					2nd European Workshop of Invertebrate Ecophysiology	SEP 10-15, 1995	CESKE BUDEJOVICE, CZECH REPUBLIC	Czech Acad Sci, Inst Entomol, Univ S Bohemia, Fac Biol Sci				Water is an essential part of all living organisms and terrestrial arthropods are no exception. They have to balance water loss and water gain to and from their bodies, often over a wide range of environmental conditions. Water exists in the arthropod body in two main forms: free, bulk or freezable water (usually forming 65-75% of fresh weight), and unfreezable water (often inappropriately termed bound water) associated with membranes and other macromolecular structures. Many factors influence the body water content of arthropods from the physical environment and climatic effects to feeding activity, metabolism and life stage. Some species are adapted to withstand dehydration (loss of 17-89% of their body weight), whilst others enter a state of anhydrobiosis or dormancy induced by partial desiccation. Body water plays an important role in arthropod cold hardiness. Partial dehydration may significantly affect the cold resistance of both freezing tolerant and freezing susceptible forms. An increase in the quantity of unfreezable water in arthropods of both strategies may occur through the production of low molecular weight sugar alcohols (polyols), and desiccation promotes polyol (e.g. glycerol) synthesis in some species. Hibernating insects and other terrestrial arthropods may be threatened by lethal desiccation in their natural habitats, and in cold environments this may be in addition to the possibility of freezing, which could result in death. Whilst a 50% reduction in body water content may double the haemolymph osmolality in an arthropod, the effect of this on its supercooling ability will depend largely on the cryoprotectant concentration and the initial haemolymph osmolality. On the other hand, partial dehydration in winter may increase the supercooling capacity of micro-arthropods by reducing ice nucleator activity. Whilst the biochemical and physiological similarities of the effects of cold and drought may be obvious, it should not be overlooked that desiccation tolerant arthropods may be pre-adapted for freezing tolerance, Thus cold and drought should be viewed as not necessarily competing mortality factors in overwintering arthropods, but as producing complementary adaptations for aiding survival in some species.																	1210-5759						1996	93	3					325	339										WOS:A1996VN62700006						
J	Convey, P				Convey, P			Overwintering strategies of terrestrial invertebrates in Antarctica - The significance of flexibility in extremely seasonal environments	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY					2nd European Workshop of Invertebrate Ecophysiology	SEP 10-15, 1995	CESKE BUDEJOVICE, CZECH REPUBLIC	Czech Acad Sci, Inst Entomol, Univ S Bohemia, Fac Biol Sci				Antarctic terrestrial communities are characterised by their geographical isolation and the survival of extreme environmental stresses. Of particular significance to life history strategies of organisms in continental and maritime. Antarctic zones is the pronounced seasonality, with short (1-4 month) cold summers and long (8-11 month) winters. Activity and growth are largely limited to the summer period, although maintenance costs, undetectable in the short-term, may become significant over winter. Sub-Antarctic invertebrate communities experience a less rigorous regime, as climatic extremes are ameliorated by their oceanic environment, with positive mean temperatures occurring over 6-12 months. Here, year-round activity and growth of invertebrates are common. This paper considers our limited knowledge of the life histories of sub-Antarctic and Antarctic terrestrial invertebrates, to identify features correlated with seasonal and/or climatic cues. There is little evidence for diapause, although seasonal patterns of variation in cold tolerance and cryoprotectant production in direct response to desiccation and decreasing temperatures have been reported. A rapid response to feeding and growth opportunity is shown by maritime. Antarctic species, irrespective of season, although moulting does not occur over winter. Associated reduction of feeding, along with arrested growth and reproductive activity due to the low thermal energy budget over winter are probably sufficient to explain the peaks of moulting and reproduction often observed at the end of winter. Generally there is a high level of flexibility in the observed species life histories, with varying developmental duration and much overlap of generations being the norm, particularly in maritime and continental Antarctica. A formal diapause may be a disadvantage in maritime and continental Antarctic zones, as it would be erroneously triggered by severe conditions during summer. In contrast, the development of specific overwintering strategies including diapause may be unnecessary or even irrelevant in much of the sub-Antarctic, where seasonality is greatly reduced and the risk of severe of stressful environmental conditions during winter is negligible.																	1210-5759	1802-8829					1996	93	3					489	505										WOS:A1996VN62700020

Geographical, clinal variation was observed in both mechanisms. Critical photoperiods increased northwards 1 h 9 min per 5 degrees of latitude. The dine relaxes north of 65 degrees N, however. The critical temperature measured under long-day conditions varied little in areas south of 63 degrees N, but increased from 13 degrees C at that latitude to 17 degrees C at 65 degrees N and to 24 degrees C at 68 degrees N. Selection experiments revealed extensive intrapopulation variation in both diapause characteristics. The mean temperature In the middle of the breeding season for C. costata is above the long-day critical temperature in areas south of 63 degrees N, the same or slightly lower than the critical temperature in areas between 63 degrees N and 66 degrees N and well below the critical temperature in areas north of 67 degrees N. The relative importance of temperature and photoperiod in diapause induction changes from south to north, the photoperiod being the main determinant in the south and temperature assuming the main role in the north. The forms and positions of the two dines can be explained when data on the estimated number of generations per year are combined with data on weather and illumination conditions at each locality.																	0018-0661						1996	124	2					151	163		10.1111/j.1601-5223.1996.00151.x								WOS:A1996VE93800007						
J	Gwinner, E				Gwinner, E			Circannual clocks in avian reproduction and migration	IBIS					21st International Ornithological Congress	AUG 21-25, 1994	VIENNA, AUSTRIA					Many behavioural and physiological functions of organisms are adjusted to the periodic changes in their environment, particularly to those related to the natural day and year. This adjustment is often achieved through the action of endogenous daily (circadian) and annual (circannual) clocks. Studies of the control of avian moult, migration and reproduction have played a major role in understanding how biological clocks function and interact with rhythms in the environment. Investigations on tropical birds such as the East African subspecies of the Stonechat (Saxicola torquata axillaris) and long-distance migrants like the Garden Warbler (Sylvia borin) have provided the longest records of circannual rhythms, some of them running for more than 12 years, with periods ranging from about 9 to 13 months. Avian circannual rhythms are organized in a characteristic way for a particular species or population, and cross-breeding experiments have shown that some of the differences found among them are genetically determined. In African Stonechats circannual rhythms guarantee that seasonal events occur at the appropriate times of the year and in the characteristic sequence. They also control a ''reproductive window'' that provides the temporal framework for breeding. The width of this window is rather inflexible but the performance of a bird within this framework (e.g. whether it breeds once or twice per season) is subject to modification by environmental conditions. In migratory birds circannual programs are involved in determining the time course, distance and direction of migration. Circannual rhythms are synchronized with and modified by environmental factors in a complex way, but the endogenous mechanisms usually respond to environmental cues such that an optimal adjustment to season and latitude is guaranteed.																	0019-1019					JAN	1996	138	1					47	63		10.1111/j.1474-919X.1996.tb04312.x								WOS:A1996TU90700006

Most data accrued from research carried out by the authors, while some were obtained from the literature, but all pertained to experiments performed in the laboratory, at 20-21 degrees C, under long daylength conditions, to facilitate unbiased comparison. The results reflecting larval growth show a high interspecific variation. On one hand, the mean weights of newly laid eggs range from 69 mu g in Chrysoperla mediterranea (Holzel) to 237 mu g in Nineta pallida (Schneider). On the other hand, the mean weights of freshly spun cocoons range from 5.0 mg in Dichochrysa flavifrons (Brauer) to 35.7 mg in N. pallida. The growth ratio was lowest (56) in Hypochrysa elegnns (Burmeister) and highest (199) in Chrysopa pallens (Rambur). The growth rate indices relating to larval development and full-brood durations - from egg to egg also revealed large interspecific differences of 15 and 13 times, respectively. Intraspecific variations in cocoon weights may occur in some species as a result of the influence of sex and winter diapause. During the stages in which there is no food intake, namely embryogenesis and pupation within the cocoon, weights decreased. The more intensive the diapause, as in the semivoltine Chrysopa regalis Navas, the lower the weight loss of the cocoons.																			2-9506536-1-8				1996							87	101										WOS:A1996BH56V00003

A gradual decrease in daylength (6 min per day) had no effect upon diapause induction. Larvae were subjected to a daily temperature rhythm (T:C = 12-hour thermophase: 12-hour cryophase) combined with photoperiod. Photoperiodic responses (PhPR) were compared for thermoperiodic conditions, and for the relative related constant temperatures equivalent to the means obtained by daily temperature summation. The recorded curves showed three situations. They were the same in both the thermoperiodic conditions and in the constant equivalent temperatures, only if the cryophase temperature was below 15 degrees C and the mean temperature rhythm was within the optimal range for PhPR, namely 20 to 27 degrees C. Thermoperiods with lower cryophase temperatures and a mean temperature lower than 20 degrees C caused a decrease in the proportion of diapausing prepupae, but those with a cryophase from 17 to 24 degrees C, alternated with higher temperatures of 30 to 33 degrees C stimulated diapause induction in contrast to PhPRs at constant temperatures. It was concluded that the seasonal cycle of Ch. perla is controlled by both photoperiod and thermoperiod in the field.																			2-9506536-1-8				1996							259	267										WOS:A1996BH56V00023

J	Ehrman, T; Cocks, PS				Ehrman, T; Cocks, PS			Reproductive patterns in annual legume species on an aridity gradient	VEGETATIO												Reproductive patterns are analysed in annual legumes of west Asia, and their relationships to increasing aridity determined by multivariate analysis. Dormancy, seed size, dispersal and fecundity are shown to be partially substitutable in terms of their effect on survival and population growth. The range of patterns show greatest diversity under mesic conditions in coastal, mediterranean areas with high winter rainfall, low incidence of frost and long growing season. Increasing aridity leads to increasing reproductive homogeneity, in which a subset of patterns - those composed of high levels of seed dormancy, high seed to pod ratios, restricted dispersal capabilities and early flowering - become predominant. These findings corroborate earlier theoretical and empirical evidence concerning desert annuals. The majority of widespread species are shown to possess ''arid-type'' patterns. This exerts considerable influence on both the type and degree of ecotypic differentiation within species. The only feature that responds consistently to climatic change is flowering time, particularly among species characterized by high seed dormancy. In the few widespread species that do not display ''arid-type'' characteristics, ecotypic differentiation appears more frequently in a larger suite of traits. The unequal environmental demands made on species showing different levels of dormancy (e.g. variation in length of growing season from year to year and place to place) leads to strong asymmetries governing the relationships between reproduction and ecological amplitude. In this respect ''arid-type'' strategists with high seed dormancy appear to have greater chances of expansion than others. This has implications when choosing pasture legumes to improve mediterranean grasslands.																	0042-3106					JAN	1996	122	1					47	59		10.1007/BF00052815								WOS:A1996TU86400005						
J	Carriere, Y; Roff, DA				Carriere, Y; Roff, DA			Change in genetic architecture resulting from the evolution of insecticide resistance: A theoretical and empirical analysis	HEREDITY												Under selection for insecticide resistance, the spread of a major resistance allele that has strong pleiotropic effects on life history characters will affect the genetic architecture of fitness. A model is developed showing that the spread of such an allele induces a change in the mean and in the additive genetic variance (heritability) of the life history characters, and in the genetic covariance (correlation) between these characters. The model was tested using a quantitative genetic study that compared, in a lepidopteran species (Choristoneura rosaceana), the genetic architecture of diapause propensity and larval weight within and among insecticide-free and insecticide-treated populations from the same geographical area. Significant genetic correlations between resistance to the insecticides and the life history traits were found within the populations, suggesting that the resistance allele(s) has pleiotropic effects on the life history characters. As resistance develops from an initial value of zero, the model predicts a positive relationship between the degree of resistance within the populations and, (1) the magnitude of the fitness costs, (2) the heritability of the life history traits, and (3) the absolute value of-the genetic correlations between pairs of life history traits. All these predictions were confirmed. Moreover, the evolution of resistance apparently affected the environmental variance in larval weight. Hence, the novel evolution of insecticide resistance appears to result in major changes in the genetic architecture of fitness, which may limit to some extent the colonization of insecticide-treated habitats.																	0018-067X					DEC	1995	75		6				618	629		10.1038/hdy.1995.181								WOS:A1995TK53800008						
J	Censky, EJ				Censky, EJ			Reproduction in two lesser antillean populations of Ameiva plei (Teiidae)	JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY												Reproduction was studied in Ameiva plei from Anguilla and Dog Island, Lesser Antilles. Reproduction was seasonal with reproductive activity concentrated in the months of May-October, and timing associated with day length and temperature. Clutch size on Anguilla averaged 3.1 (range 1-7) and 2.1 (range 1-3) on Dog Island. Clutch size was positively correlated with body size on both islands and appeared to be unrelated to environmental factors except as insofar as body size is related to such factors. Females on Anguilla produced multiple clutches within a season, depending on their size, while on Dog Island there was no evidence of a second clutch.																	0022-1511					DEC	1995	29	4					553	560		10.2307/1564738								WOS:A1995TK75800007

As the birds from the two subspecies were raised and kept under comparable laboratory conditions, differences in metabolic rate between the two subspecies had to be genetically determined. RMR peaked during moult in both subspecies. During the rest of the year RMR was fairly constant in both subspecies and assumed to reflect basal metabolic rate (BMR). African stonechats had a 22% lower mass specific BMR than European stonechats, which is thought to reflect a genetical physiological adaptation to the differences in environmental circumstances they experience in the field. A low BMR makes an animal more susceptible to cold. Hence, the relatively high plumage mass in the African compared to the European stonechat may be functionally linked to its relatively low BMR. Moult costs, calculated from the plumage masses and the differences in RMR inside and outside the moult period, tended to be higher in the European compared to the African stonechats. These data and an interspecific comparison of moult costs over various species of birds support the earlier notion by Lindstrom et al. (1993) that moult costs are more closely linked with BMR than with body mass or rate of moult. The relation between moult costs and BMR and the fact that the efficiency of moult is extremely low (3.8 and 6.4% for European and African stonechats, respectively) suggest that the maintenance of specific tissues necessary for moult is a large cost factor. Alternatively, impaired insulation during moult may necessitate an increased metabolic capacity which may be associated with an increased RMR.

J	SPAAK, P				SPAAK, P			SEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN DAPHNIA - INTERSPECIFIC DIFFERENCES IN A HYBRID SPECIES COMPLEX	OECOLOGIA												To investigate whether reproductive variation in the Daphnia galeata-cucullata-hyalina hybrid species complex can explain the occurrence of hybrids and backcrosses, a total of 43 clones from three north German lakes were tested for allocation to sexual reproduction under equal stress conditions. Six replicates per clone were followed until the seventh adult instar. I used the following cues to promote sexual reproduction: short photoperiod, water from a crowded Daphnia culture, fish-conditioned water and low food concentration. For each animal, clutch size and clutch sex were recorded. Ephippia, which were empty since the animals were cultured individually, were only produced by D. cucullata and D. cucullata x hyalina (26% and 6% of the broods, respectively), whereas almost all taxa produced males (the range was 2-15%). Intraspecific variation for male and ephippial production was also found. The fact that the taxa tested show different responses to the stimuli offered may indicate that there is reproductive isolation between them. This is supported by field data from the Tjeukemeer (The Netherlands) which shows that D. galeata mostly produces ephippia in spring and D. cucullata in autumn. The presence of hybrids with ephippia in both seasons, however, shows that backcrossing is also possible.																	0029-8549					DEC	1995	104	4					501	507		10.1007/BF00341348								WOS:A1995TJ37500013	28307666

Esterases and MDH were polymorphic in the majority of populations studied. Geographic patterns in esterases and MDH allele frequencies were observed among populations collected from fruit trees and roses. A dendrogram constructed by the phenetic cluster analysis based on the genetic distance values showed that these populations could be divided into three geographic groups. However, there seemed to be no particular geographic pattern in any enzyme variation in populations from herbaceous hosts, and the allele frequencies differed greatly even among geographically neighboring populations.																	0003-6862					NOV	1995	30	4					567	579		10.1303/aez.30.567								WOS:A1995TH24800009						
J	LINDER, CR; SCHMITT, J				LINDER, CR; SCHMITT, J			POTENTIAL PERSISTENCE OF ESCAPED TRANSGENES - PERFORMANCE OF TRANSGENIC, OIL-MODIFIED BRASSICA SEEDS AND SEEDLINGS	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												We performed two experiments designed to assess the risk that seed-oil-modification transgenes will increase the persistence of feral Brassica napus canola and interspecific hybrids of B. napus canola and wild Brassica rapa, a weedy relative. The first experiment, conducted at field sites in California and Georgia where oil-modified canola will be grown commercially, tested whether buried seeds of transgenic high-stearate canola had increased survivorship and dormancy. Performance of the high-stearate type was compared to nontransgenic null segregant and parental lines. In California, no differences in initial proportions of dormant seeds and rates of exit could be detected between high-stearate canola and its controls, suggesting low probability that high-stearate canola will form a larger or more persistent seed bank than its nonpersistent controls. In Georgia, although high-stearate canola initially had as low or lower proportions of dormant seeds than its controls, high-stearate seeds exhibited no detectable exit from the seed bank, whereas both controls had significant rates of exit. Hence, escaped high-stearate seed may persist for a longer period than its controls at this site. Differences between the sites highlight the need to conduct risk assessment over the range where a transgenic crop will be commercialized. The second experiment, a greenhouse study, measured the relative ability of oil-modified canolas and wild X crop hybrids to emerge from four depths in the soil (0, 0.5, 4, and 10 cm) and their subsequent seedling vigor. We tested lines of B, napus canola carrying either the hi,oh-stearate gene or a transgene for high-laurate production, using nontransgenic parental types as controls. We also examined the impact of the high-laurate transgene in interspecific wild B. rapa X B. napus canola hybrids. Performance of the high-laurate hybrids was compared to nontransgenic hybrids and the B. rapa wild parent. For all seed types, no seedlings emerged from 10 cm, and all seedlings emerged from 0 and 0.5 cm. A higher proportion of high-stearate canola emerged from 4 cm than its control, but for all depths, high-stearate canola emerged more slowly and had significantly less biomass than its control 2 and 4 wk following emergence. In contrast, high-laurate canola's total emergence and timing of emergence could not be distinguished from its control. Although high-laurate canola's 2-wk biomass was less than that of its control, by 4 wk, its biomass was equivalent due to its significantly higher relative growth rate during that period. The different results for the two oil-modification transgenes suggest that even transgenes with similar functions should be considered on a case-by-case basis. From 0 and 0.5 cm, high-laurate wild X canola hybrids' total emergence, timing of emergence, and biomass accumulation were indistinguishable from their wild parent. High-laurate hybrids emerged more rapidly and had greater biomass at 2 wk than their hybrid controls. Our results indicate that high-laurate hybrids, emerged from shallow depths, may experience performance advantages that will allow them to perform as well as their persistent, wild parent.																	1051-0761					NOV	1995	5	4					1056	1068		10.2307/2269354								WOS:A1995TF37500019

The genotypic variation in expression of barley reaction to short day was revealed; it concerned ontogeny stages and the levels of phenotypic display. In direct diallelic crossings with four barley varieties, the inheritance of the plant reaction expressivity to short day was determined. Varieties under study differed in the reaction expressivity, which was manifested phenotypically during formation of the generative sphere, and were neutral to light quality and elevated growing temperature. It was shown that the plant sensitivity to short day is controlled by four genes Ssd1-4. The dominant gene Ssd1 (insensitivity to short day) is epistatic to the recessive genes ssd2-4 (sensitivity to short day); while the dominant genes Ssd2-4 are epistatic to the gene Ssd1 both in the dominant and the recessive states. Genotypes of the varieties studied, at the loci Ssd1-4, were determined.																	0016-6758					NOV	1995	31	11					1534	1539										WOS:A1995TM32400010						
J	Huntley, B; Berry, PM; Cramer, W; McDonald, AP				Huntley, B; Berry, PM; Cramer, W; McDonald, AP			Modelling present and potential future ranges of some European higher plants using climate response surfaces	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												It is hypothesized that the principal features of higher plant distributions at continental scales are determined by the macroclimate. Bioclimate data have been computed on a 50 km grid across Europe. Along with published maps of higher plant distributions based upon the same grid, these data have been used to derive climate response surfaces that model the relationship between a species' distribution and the present climate. Eight species representative of a variety of phytogeographic patterns have been investigated. The results support the hypothesis that the European distributions of all eight species are principally determined by macroclimate and illustrate the nature of the climatic constraints upon each species. Simulated future distributions in equilibrium with 2 x CO2 climate scenarios derived from two alternative GCMs show that all of the species are likely to experience major shifts in their potential range if such climatic changes take place. Some species may suffer substantial range and population reductions and others may face the threat of extinction. The rate of the forecast climate changes is such that few, if any, species may be able to maintain their ranges in equilibrium with the changing climate. In consequence, the transient impacts upon ecosystems will be varied but often may lead to a period of dominance by opportunist, early-successional species. Our simulations of potential ranges take no account of such factors as photoperiod or the direct effects of CO2, both of which may substantially alter the realized future equilibrium.

J	Norment, CJ				Norment, CJ			Prebasic (postnuptial) molt in free-ranging Harris' Sparrows, Zonotrichia querula, in the Northwest Territories, Canada	CANADIAN FIELD-NATURALIST												Harris' Sparrows (Zonotrichia querula) in the Northwest Territories. Canada, in 1989-1991, were single-brooded, although they occasionally replaced a clutch if the loss occured prior to hatching. Harris' Sparrow breeding chronology is highly synchronized, and the fledging period for first nests was 3-14 July. Of 21 adult Harris' Sparrows captured on or after 3 July, no bird captured prior to 13 July was molting; estimated dates for prebasic molt initiation in 10 birds captured after beginning molt ranged from 13 to 18 July. The almost complete separation of the nestling phase and molt initiation support the idea that most Harris' Sparrows at my study site did not begin prebasic molt until after their young fledged. This is similar to most passerines breeding at high latitudes, including White-crowned Sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophrys). However, my results contradict results of previous workers who found that caged Harris' Sparrows exposed to natural photoperiods found on their breeding grounds initiated prebasic molt at the time when breeding Harris' Sparrows should be feeding nestlings. This difference may be attributed to earlier use of birds which had not participated in the reproductive cycle.																	0008-3550					OCT-DEC	1995	109	4					470	472										WOS:A1995TY60500022

The founder population originated from southwest France, The study was conducted between 1986 and 1989 on birds aged from 1 day to 2 years, exposed to a seasonal photoperiod corresponding to latitude 16 degrees N during autumn and winter and latitude 48 degrees N during the remainder of the year. Under these conditions, adult quail showed two annual moults with only the post-breeding one being complete, The pre-breeding moult essentially involved the throat feathers, Large interindividual variation was observed in the duration, timing and development of the post-breeding moult: 60% of the studied birds suspended moult when they developed migratory restlessness and then finished renewing their feathers during the winter, The post-juvenile moult was also suspended when 7-9 weeks old (3-6 primaries and 1-10 secondaries renewed), After this suspension, the length of which was related to the hatching date, the moult continued up to p7. The three outer primaries were kept for the first year and were replaced only during the postbreeding moult, Based on the examination of wing patterns, our study provides reliable criteria for discriminating between age classes, The numbers of primaries and secondaries simultaneously in growth or renewed were different between the age classes, The secondaries of adults were renewed later in the moult stage than were the secondaries of juveniles. These criteria provide field researchers with a guide that enables them to age quail with reasonable accuracy.																	0019-1019					OCT	1995	137	4					570	581										WOS:A1995TF62100015						
J	LAVOREL, S; CHESSON, P				LAVOREL, S; CHESSON, P			HOW SPECIES WITH DIFFERENT REGENERATION NICHES COEXIST IN PATCHY HABITATS WITH LOCAL DISTURBANCES	OIKOS												We used a two-species simulation model to study mechanisms of coexistence of annual plants in patchy habitats with local disturbances. In habitats with nested scales of patchiness, short dispersal is advantageous because favorable habitat tends to be aggregated. The invasion of a resident population with short dispersal distance by a species with longer-range dispersal was simulated for combinations of habitat pattern, disturbance frequency and germination strategies. A germination strategy was defined by the type of response to disturbance (''disturbance-broken'' when disturbances trigger germination, ''risk-spreading'' when germination is insensitive to disturbance) and the dormancy fraction at dispersal. Simulations estimated the long-term low-density growth rate of the invader, the mean local crowding (number of competing seeds per invader seed at each site) and the effective fecundity of each species (the mean number of seeds successfully dispersed per adult plant). Crowding increased with habitat suitability and decreased with increasing dormancy fractions for the resident. Effective fecundity in a landscape can be taken as a measure of competitive ability. The short-dispersing resident invariably had higher effective fecundity, but this difference decreased with increasing suitability, i.e. competitive differences decreased. Coexistence depended on both habitat suitability and disturbance frequency. Maximum coexistence was obtained for habitats of intermediate suitability with moderately frequent disturbances. General linear modelling of the long-term low-density growth rate showed that coexistence results from a reduction in local crowding. This growth rate also increased for increasing habitat suitability and connectivity, and for a higher dormancy fraction of the resident species. The effects of disturbance frequency and of invader's dormancy fraction depended on the type of dormancy of the resident species. The analysis showed that 2 different mechanisms are involved in the coexistence of species with different niches. Differences in regeneration niches permit coexistence through competitive equivalency with trade-offs between dispersal and germination traits, but for a limited range of habitat pattern and disturbance conditions. On the other hand, coexistence through density fluctuations of a disturbance-broken species and storage effects can be achieved for a broad range of environmental conditions and species germination strategies. Species coexistence thus results from the combination of two mechanisms. Evidence from natural communities is discussed. Our results also demonstrate the importance of detailed attention to spatial patterns and dispersal because of the complexity of spatial effects. Further, spatial pattern and disturbance frequencies need to be considered jointly to understand the dynamics of diversity.																	0030-1299					OCT	1995	74	1					103	114		10.2307/3545679								WOS:A1995TJ35900011

The original view that metabolic rate is reduced below the basal metabolic rate because the lowered body temperature reduces tissue metabolism has been challenged by a recent hypothesis which claims that metabolic rate during torpor is actively downregulated and is a function of the differential between body temperature and ambient temperature, rather than body temperature per se. In the present study, both the steady-state metabolic rate and body temperature of torpid stripe-faced dunnarts, Sminthopsis macroura (Dasyuridae: Marsupialia), showed two clearly different phases in response to change of air temperature. At air temperatures between 14 and 30 degrees C, metabolic rate and body temperature decreased with air temperature, and metabolic rate showed an exponential relationship with body temperature (r(2) = 0.74). The O-10 for metabolic rate was between 2 and 3 over the body temperature range of 16 to 32 degrees C. The difference between body temperature and air temperature over this temperature range did not change significantly, and the metabolic rate was not related to the difference between body temperature and air temperature (P = 0.35). However, the apparent conductance decreased with air temperature. At air temperatures below 14 degrees C, metabolic rate increased linearly with the decrease of air temperature (r(2) = 0.58) and body temperature was maintained above 16 degrees C, largely independent of air temperature. Over this air temperature range, metabolic rate was positively correlated with the difference between body temperature and air temperature (r(2) = 0.61). Nevertheless, the Q(10) for metabolic rate between normothermic and torpid thermoregulating animals at the same air temperature was also in the range of 2-3. These results suggest that over the air temperature range in which body temperature of S. macroura was not metabolically defended, metabolic rate during daily torpor was largely a function of body temperature. At air temperatures below 14 degrees C, at which the torpid animals showed an increase of metabolic rate to regulate body temperature, the negative relationship between metabolic rate and air temperature was a function of the differential between body temperature and air temperature as during normothermia. However, even in thermoregulating animals, the reduction of metabolic rate from normothermia to torpor at a given air temperature can also be explained by temperature effects.																	0174-1578					SEP	1995	165	4					291	297		10.1007/BF00367312								WOS:A1995RT92100005	7560307

Female cottonmouths there produce relatively large litters and attain sexual maturity at sizes greater than reported elsewhere. Meristic characters of the northernmost population differ only slightly or not at all from neighboring populations in southeastern Virginia or northeastern North Carolina, but melanism increases significantly southward. Vitellogenesis, ovulation, and birth in the northernmost population appear to occur several weeks later than in southern populations. Most small cottonmouths did not survive cold winters and few individuals less than 600 mm snout-vent length were observed; thus the population is comprised largely of older snakes (>4 yr). Most mature females (91.7%) reproduced annually. Winter mortality in hibernacula may be an important limiting factor in this northernmost population of cottonmouths.																	0022-1511					SEP	1995	29	3					391	398		10.2307/1564989								WOS:A1995TA49100009

The analysis of these inbred lines suggests that the difference in the photoperiodic response between the original diapausing and non-diapausing strains is due to genes at three or four loci and at least one of these loci is located on the X chromosome. The original diapausing strain and two inbred lines exhibited circadian peaks when subjected to the Nanda-Hamner protocol, although they had different critical daylengths. This suggests that critical daylength is modified independently of the circadian oscillation system in this species. On the other hand, diapause duration was correlated with critical daylength among the inbred lines and the original diapausing strain, suggesting that these two traits are under the control of the same genetic system.																	0307-6962					SEP	1995	20	3					253	256		10.1111/j.1365-3032.1995.tb00009.x								WOS:A1995TH68100009						
J	GOMI, T				GOMI, T			EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON DIAPAUSE RESPONSE TO PHOTOPERIOD IN HYPHANTRIA-CUNEA WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO LOCAL DIVERGENCE	APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY												After the fall webworm, Hyphantria cunea, was introduced into Japan from North America in 1945, a bivoltine life cycle was maintained throughout its distribution in Japan for three decades (MASAKI, 1975). The critical photoperiod for the induction of pupal diapause was 14 h 35 min (25 degrees C) in two local populations at 35.3 and 39.5 degrees N, as in the founder population (MASAKI et al., 1968), and was relatively stable over a range of temperatures from 17 to 25 degrees C (MASAKI, 1977). Recently, a trivoltine life cycle was found in localities south of 36 degrees N, although bivoltinism is still the rule in the northern areas (Gomi and TAKEDA, 1990, 1991). The bivoltine and trivoltine: populations show a significant difference in critical photoperiod for the induction of diapause (GOMI, 1992). This species is a long-day type and develops without diapause under long-day conditions. In this type of photoperiodic response, the critical photoperiod is generally shortened by high temperatures in insects (DANKS, 1987). The present study examines whether H. cunea populations derived from the bivoltine and trivoltine areas exhibit such a temperature-dependent change in critical photoperiod, and discusses the possibility that such a response is involved in the recent shift of the life cycle from bivoltine to trivoltine. In one of the two populations examined, I found a marked effect of temperature on the incidence of diapause. Whereas the stage sensitive to photoperiod for diapause induction is known to occur in early larval instars (MASAKI, 1977), the stage sensitive to temperature has not been studied. Because insects usually experience fluctuating temperatures in the field, such information is important in discussing the life cycle and voltinism in local populations. In die second half of this paper, therefore, I present data on the stage sensitive to temperature for diapause induction in this species.																	0003-6862					AUG	1995	30	3					490	492		10.1303/aez.30.490								WOS:A1995RR93200016

Diapause in postfeeding third-instar larvae is important for winter survival in this species, especially under the cool climate which prevails in the northern areas of its distribution (VINOGRADOVA, 1984, 1991). Diapause is primarily determined by the short-day conditions experienced by the female parent, although high temperatures in the larval period can prevent the induction of diapause programmed by the short-day conditions in the maternal generation (VINOGRADOVA and ZINOVJEVA, 1972; SAUNDERS et al., 1986). The upper threshold temperature for the induction of diapause is between 12 and 17 degrees C in various geographic populations (VINOGRADOVA and ZINOVJEVA, 1972; SAUNDERS et al., 1986; VINOGRADOVA, 1991). Larvae of this species develop promptly even at low temperatures. The period from egg hatching to maximum weight is only 5.66 d at 15 degrees C (DAVIES and RATCLIFFE, 1994). Thus, C. vicina may produce an additional generation in a relatively warm autumn. Furthermore, in the natural habitat of larvae, i.e., carcasses or feces of animals, heat is produced as a result of the digestive activity of microorganisms and the activity of enzymes secreted by the larvae themselves. The temperature in the natural habitat of larvae is likely to be much higher than ambient temperature, especially in carcasses of large animals. It is, therefore, interesting to observe how temperature influences the onset of diapause in this species. Such information is important for understanding how larvae of this species enter diapause in the appropriate seasons in natural conditions. In the present study, we examine the sensitive stage for the diapause-averting effect of high temperatures.

J	HAIRSTON, NG; KEARNS, CM				HAIRSTON, NG; KEARNS, CM			THE INTERACTION OF PHOTOPERIOD AND TEMPERATURE IN DIAPAUSE TIMING - A COPEPOD EXAMPLE	BIOLOGICAL BULLETIN												In many organisms, photoperiod and temperature are thought to be the most significant token cues for seasonally timed life history events, including diapause in arthropods. A common pattern in many species of terrestrial insects and several copepod species is the existence of a critical daylength on one side of which the animals do not enter diapause and on the other side of which they do. Temperature plays a secondary role as modifier of the critical daylength. In some species, however, including the freshwater copepod Diaptomus sanguineus, the fraction of females making subitaneous eggs (eggs that hatch immediately) undergoes a very gradual transition as daylength changes over the natural range of photoperiods experienced in nature. Here we show that temperature is as important as photoperiod in cuing diapause timing in a population of D. sanguineus living in Bullhead Pond, Rhode Island. When ecologically relevant photoperiod and temperature cues are provided in the laboratory, the copepods rapidly switch from producing subitaneous eggs to producing diapausing eggs in a way that is typical of the seasonal switch seen in the pond. We provide a graphical model that illustrates how copepod sensitivities to photoperiod and temperature interact to produce an abrupt transition, and we discuss how natural selection should act on D. sanguineus diapause response to produce the variation in diapause timing seen within and between natural populations.																	0006-3185					AUG	1995	189	1					42	48		10.2307/1542200								WOS:A1995RN59900007	29281421					
J	TSAI, KH				TSAI, KH			GENIC ANALYSIS FOR HEADING TIME IN WILD-RICE STRAINS	JAPANESE JOURNAL OF GENETICS												Rice cultivars so far examined mostly had the early-heading gene, Ef-1. Their wild progenitor, Oryza rufipogon Griff., was examined in respect to the genes for heading time in the present study. Of three strains tested, W593 from Malaysia and W1623 from Tauyuan, Taiwan produced no panicles when planted in the first crop season at Taichung, suggesting their strong sensitivity to photoperiod, while W630 from Burma was practically insensitive to photoperiod and produced panicles. In the second crop season, the wild strains headed several days later than Taichung 65. When they were crossed with Taichung 65, the heading dates of the F-1 plants were similar to, or a few days earlier than that of Taichung 65. In the B1F1 (T65 X F-1) populations, early-heading plants like Ef-1 carriers were found. They were backcrossed to Taichung 65 several times and true-breeding early-heading lines were obtained. When they were crossed with T65(20)E(a) carrying Ef-1(a), the heading dates of the F-2 plants varied within the parental range, suggesting that the wild strains had similar alleles at the Ef-1 locus. Regarding genes controlling photoperiod sensitivity W593 and W1623 were found to have recessive ones denominated as se-7 (t) and se-6 (t), respectively. The effect of these genes can be suppressed by Ef-1 when combined together.																	0021-504X					AUG	1995	70	4					555	562		10.1266/jjg.70.555								WOS:A1995RX85900008						
J	BRADFORD, MJ; ROFF, DA				BRADFORD, MJ; ROFF, DA			GENETIC AND PHENOTYPIC SOURCES OF LIFE-HISTORY VARIATION ALONG A CLINE IN VOLTINISM IN THE CRICKET ALLONEMOBIUS-SOCIUS	OECOLOGIA												Clinal variation in life histories can be genetically based, resulting from selection imposed by different environments, or it may be due to the differential expression of phenotypically plastic traits. We examined the dine in voltinism in the egg-diapausing cricket Allonemobius socius, with populations spanning the switch from a univoltine to a bivoltine phenology. A common garden experiment was employed, using environments that mimicked photoperiod and temperature conditions found in the field. There were only small differences in development time among populations, and the difference in phenology observed in the field is likely due to clinal variation in the length of the growing season. We found large genetically-based differences in the reaction norm for egg diapause that were further magnified by environmental cues. The synergism of genetic and environmental effects was an example of cogradient selection. In the zone of transition between phenologies, voltinism appeared to be a conditional strategy, rather than a genetic polymorphism. First-generation females from this area can lay either direct-developing or diapause eggs depending on the likelihood that a second generation will have sufficient time to develop. For this species, the dine in voltinism is the result of a combination of environmental effects on development, and genetic and environmental influences on egg diapause propensity.																	0029-8549	1432-1939				AUG	1995	103	3					319	326		10.1007/BF00328620								WOS:A1995RR94800008	28306825

We detected these responses in individuals who were exposed to artificial ''days'' of different durations. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether men who are exposed to natural and artificial light in an urban environment at 39 degrees N are still able to detect and respond to seasonal changes in duration of the natural photoperiod. We measured profiles of circadian rhythms during 24-h periods of constant darkness (<1 Ix) and found no summer-winter differences in durations of nocturnal periods of active secretion of melatonin, rising levels of cortisol, high levels of thyrotropin, and low levels of rectal temperature. The results of this and our previous study suggest that modern men's use of artificial light suppresses responses to seasonal changes in the natural photoperiod that might otherwise occur at this latitude.

J	MOUSSEAU, TA; ROFF, DA				MOUSSEAU, TA; ROFF, DA			GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO GEOGRAPHIC-VARIATION IN THE OVIPOSITOR LENGTH OF A CRICKET	ECOLOGY												Females of many insects possess an ovipositor, which in crickets is usually used to place eggs deep into the soil. Ovipositor length in female striped ground crickets (Allonemobius socius) increased at higher latitudes and altitudes in North America, despite an opposing trend in overall body size. Crickets inhabiting regions with short growing seasons and long, cold winters invariably had longer ovipositors than crickets inhabiting warmer regions. The only exception to this observation was for first generation crickets in bivoltine populations where there was no pattern of geographic variation in ovipositor length. However, second generation females from these same populations always had longer ovipositors than their first generation ancestors, and followed a pattern of geographic variation similar to that found for univoltine crickets. Overall, these results support Masaki's (1986) model, which predicts that longer ovipositors will evolve in northern cricket populations as an evolutionary response to the selective advantages of overwintering eggs being oviposited deep in the soil in cold habitats. In order to determine the mechanisms underlying patterns of phenotypic variation in the wild, and to test the hypothesis that interpopulation variation reflects genetic differentiation while intergeneration variation within a population reflects environmentally induced phenotypic plasticity, crickets from eight populations were brought to the laboratory and reared through three generations in a common garden. It was found that laboratory-reared populations varied significantly in ovipositor length, with the pattern of variation mimicking that found for field-collected crickets. This finding supports the hypothesis that geographic variation in the wild has a significant genetic basis. The influence of environment on ovipositor length was examined in 20 full-sib families from a bivoltine population. Crickets reared in ''autumn-like'' conditions (30 degrees C, 15:9 h, L:D), such as might be experienced by second generation bivoltine crickets in the wild, were generally larger and had significantly longer ovipositors than siblings reared under ''spring-like'' conditions (27 degrees C, 11:13 h, L:D). This pattern corresponds to that observed for bivoltine populations in the wild and suggests the importance of environmental cues for phenotypic plasticity, or polyphenism in ovipositor length in bivoltine populations of this cricket.

J	CARRIERE, Y; ROFF, DA; DELAND, JP				CARRIERE, Y; ROFF, DA; DELAND, JP			THE JOINT EVOLUTION OF DIAPAUSE AND INSECTICIDE RESISTANCE - A TEST OF AN OPTIMALITY MODEL	ECOLOGY												The goal of this study was to assess whether selection for insecticide resistance resulted in evolutionary change in diapause propensity in the obliquebanded leafroller, Choristoneura rosaceana. Caterpillars that diapause under bark in midsummer were assumed to escape exposure to insecticides. Estival larval diapause was modeled as a bet-hedging strategy that reduces the risk of reproductive failure in a stochastic seasonal environment and decreases mortality due to insecticides. The proportion of larvae entering estival diapause in populations within a local geographic area was predicted to increase in orchards treated with insecticides after midsummer. As predicted, insects from populations exposed to insecticides evolved a higher propensity to diapause than individuals from insecticide-free populations. A second prediction of the model was that the proportion of diapause in a population should be negatively correlated with survival of the non-diapausing larvae to insecticides applied after midsummer. This prediction was not supported; there was a positive correlation between diapause propensity and the estimated survival to the insecticides. A simulation model indicated that this unexpected correlation did not result from a non-equilibrium situation in which diapause propensity and physiological resistance evolved at different rates across orchards exposed to different insecticide regimes. A positive across-population correlation between physiological resistance and diapause suggests pleiotropic effects of the resistance allele(s). Such pleiotropic effects could result in a correlated response of diapause following strong directional selection for physiological resistance and may explain the inadequacy of the optimality model to predict the evolutionary trajectory of diapause propensity across the insecticide-treated populations.																	0012-9658					JUL	1995	76	5					1497	1505		10.2307/1938151								WOS:A1995RE89200011

Atrazine applied to dormant plant-soil microcosms reduced below-ground (crown plus root) biomass and shoot total nonstructural carbohydrate levels during regrowth, Atrazine application increased shoot chlorophyll content, N levels, and nitrate reductase activity, but not total plant N content, Decreased belowground biomass accumulation, and increased shoot N and nitrate reductase activity levels were linked to decreased total nonstructural carbohydrate availability, Total plant P levels were highest at the intermediate atrazine rate, Differences in soil microbial biomass and activities, and chemical properties resulted primarily from presence of blue grama and duration of plant regrowth. Soil nitrifying activity was depressed in soil previously exposed to atrazine whether or not blue grama was present, Hydroxyatrazine was not identified as an important factor in observed plant or soil changes, Atrazine may alter shortgrass system structure and function by immediate impacts on primary producers and long-term impacts on soil microbial processes.																	0022-409X					JUL	1995	48	4					298	306		10.2307/4002481								WOS:A1995RH22400002

Tolerance was related to larval density during rearing as well as larval age. When larvae from a group of populations freshly obtained from different locations in Africa and Asia were prepared in a similar way for fumigation, a wide range of tolerances was observed, indicating the possible presence of phosphine resistance in at least one strain.

An inverted-U function occurred with food intake increasing 30 and 60 min after doses of 1.0 and 2.0 mu g NPY. When photostimulated (20:4-h light-dark), birds increased daily caloric intake and gained weight rapidly. Birds maintained on long day lengths significantly increased food intake after 0.25 and 0.5 mu g of NPY and did not respond to higher doses. The effective dose range for NPY to increase food intake moved to the left, suggesting an increase in sensitivity to the peptide on long day lengths. In summary, white-crowned sparrows consume more food when administered NPY ivt and have increased sensitivity when photostimulated and gaining weight. Hence NPY may be a natural stimulator of food intake in this species.																	0363-6119	1522-1490				JUN	1995	268	6					R1418	R1422										WOS:A1995RE35700011

Our research was carried out in Northern Finland, at latitude 69 degrees 10'N, where the daily light-dark rhythm has a polar pattern: constant darkness starts on November 26th and lasts about 10 weeks, while the polar day of about 10 weeks starts on May 15th. We had previously found distinct daily rhythms in reindeer melatonin secretion in autumn, winter and spring but not at all in summer. Here we determine how the daily melatonin pattern develops after the period of polar day and how it disappears at the beginning of that period. Melatonin showed increased concentrations very soon after the first sunset. Thereafter the daily pattern developed gradually and was fully developed around the autumn equinox. Its shape was asymmetric and the maximum amplitude occurred near the end of the dark period. The disappearance of this daily pattern in spring was also gradual. The maximal concentrations depended on ambient illumination, especially the duration of the dark period. In spring the reindeer appeared to be more sensitive to light than in autumn. Additionally illumination of the same magnitude suppressed serum melatonin levels more effectively before midnight than afterwards, which is in accordance with the asymmetric secretion pattern. Melatonin secretion was always suppressed when the ambient illumination exceeded 1,000 Ix. The pattern of melatonin secretion in reindeer is different from those described earlier and hence the reindeer may serve as a model for melatonin secretion at high latitudes. We suggest that, in addition to the duration of the melatonin secretion, changes in amplitude are also of importance in the reindeer.																	0003-1569					JUN	1995	35	3					203	214										WOS:A1995RT97300003

The collared lemming (Dicrostonyx groenlandicus), an arctic species, also undergoes a seasonal transition in body mass, but one that is temporally out of phase with that observed in species from lower latitudes; whereas temperate species increase in mass when exposed to relatively long day lengths, collared lemmings do so under long but decreasing day lengths. This adaptation may be in response to the timing of peak above-ground biomass in the arctic. Validation of this hypothesis requires a more thorough examination of both collared lemmings and other arctic species. In the collared lemming, photoperiod-mediated changes in body mass are correlated with changes in serum concentrations of prolactin, thyroid hormones, corticosterone, and growth hormone, and pineal concentrations of melatonin. These observations are compared to those obtained with temperate small mammals, and possible cause-and-effect relationships between body mass and hormonal parameters are discussed.																	0003-1569					JUN	1995	35	3					246	258										WOS:A1995RT97300007

The investigation war performed on five populations of the speckled wood butterfly, Pararge aegeria (L.) (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae), from central and south Sweden, England, Spain and Madeira. Insects from all five populations were reared at all daylengths from 10 h to 20 h at 17 degrees C. Larval and pupal development times were noted. Predictions were met regarding the type of life-cycle regulation and the shape of reaction norms. Evidence for diapause (larval summer and winter diapause, pupal winter diapause) was found in the three northern populations (P. a. tircis) but not in the two southern populations (P. a. aegeria). Photoperiodic thresholds for diapause induction followed the predicted latitudinal patterns, and this was also the case regarding quantitative regulation of development time (by photoperiod) among directly developing individuals. Under direct development, development time was progressively shorter in shorter daylengths in the two Swedish populations, where this signals progressively later dates. This was not found in the English, Spanish and Madeiran populations where such a response is likely to be maladaptive, because one or more generations of larvae are present before summer solstice. There were also unexpected results, for which we propose preliminary adaptive explanations.

Sensitivity to protease indicated that the INAs were proteinaceous. The INAs were stable at at least 50 degrees C for 5 min, and active over a broad pH range (pH 2.0 to 8.0) and after delipidation treatments. These results suggest that the chemical characteristics of the INAs of the muscle in the diapausing larvae are similar to those of the exogenous agents in the nondiapausing ones in Fusarium sp. After differential centrifugation of muscle homogenate of the diapausing larvae, the crystallization temperature of the 105,000g pellet was the highest of all fractions separated, implying that INAs are present in microsome membrane.

Significant differences in days to pupation for postdiapausing larvae were found between different geographic locations, and between bivoltine and univoltine populations of the European corn borer in North Dakota. The differences in the time required for postdiapause development is believed to be the major contributing factor responsible for voltinism of the European corn borer population in North Dakota. Larvae from most of the sites had some degree of similarity to the bivoltine population, as measured by the proportion of the larvae pupating at less than or equal to 220 DD. Retention of the bivoltine trait allows a mechanism for the expression of a second generation in populations that had been considered univoltine. Retention of the bivoltine trait supports the importance of local adaptations in determining the voltinism of European corn borer populations in the northern Great Plains.																	0046-225X					JUN	1995	24	3					564	570		10.1093/ee/24.3.564								WOS:A1995RE60500010

Populations were from two locations in the United States (Iowa and Delaware) and two locations in Eurasia (France and Ukraine/Moldavia/Crimea). Large intrapopulation variation was observed in preoviposition, interoviposition, and number of days on which eggs were laid. This variation was a result of 10-35% of females entering diapause, whereas most females initiated oviposition within 12 d of eclosion and continued egg laying with interoviposition periods of < 6 d. No significant differences among the four populations were detected in preoviposition, interoviposition, or number of days on which eggs were laid. In addition, preimaginal development time, sex ratio, and life table parameters, including intrinsic rates of increase and fecundity, did not differ significantly among the four populations. On the basis of the parameters measured, we conclude that these four populations of C. septempunctata have not undergone local adaptation that would define these populations on the basis of geographical origin.																	0046-225X					JUN	1995	24	3					581	587		10.1093/ee/24.3.581								WOS:A1995RE60500013

A. womersleyi matured in 4.92 and 4.67 d, and consumed 15.32 and 11.54 spider mite eggs, respectively. In the first 10 d after eclosion, adult female A. longispinosus and A. womersleyi consumed an average of 26.43 and 32.07 spider mite eggs daily, and laid 2.92 and 3.07 eggs per day, respectively. A. womersleyi developed slightly faster than A. longispinosus and was more voracious. Larvae of both species were observed eating spider mite eggs. Adult female A. womersleyi incompletely consumed spider mite eggs when food was abundant. When mated with male A. longispinosus, all female A. womersleyi oviposited but with reduced fecundity. Only male offspring were produced and 47.8% of eggs were nonviable. However, only 1.5% of female A. longispinosus that mated with male A. womersleyi oviposited, but offspring of both sexes were produced. Hybrid F-1 progeny inherited the maternal setal length of dorsal seta L8 in all reciprocal matings. These findings suggested that these two mites are distinct species.

This study provided an alternative approach to analyzing stage-frequency data for determining stage transition times. It differed from the nearest published method in two vital areas: stage frequencies were expressed as the inverse of the proportion of insects in the sample that had not reached the relevant stage; mean-stage transition times were estimated by fitting a nonlinear curve to the changes in proportions with time. Mean developmental times for instar II, III, and IV, and mean adult emergence times were obtained by subtracting the estimated mean stage transition time from the mean of the previous stage. Temperature-mean developmental time relationships were described with nonlinear functions, which provided curves with a good fit, with r(2) ranging from 0.964 to 0.998. Mean developmental times were 3- to 5-fold longer for instars III and IV than for instars I and II. The estimated optimum temperatures for development were 41.8, 34.0, 34.4, 34.2, and 32.7 degrees C for instars I, II, III, and IV, and pupae, respectively. The relationship between temperature and mean adult emergence times was also described using a nonlinear function but may have been confounded by the effects of temperature on adult activity and diapause. Stage-specific survival was generally high except at the temperature extremes. Only instar III exhibited density-dependent mortality.																	0046-225X					JUN	1995	24	3					623	634		10.1093/ee/24.3.623								WOS:A1995RE60500018

This remarkably rapid spread of a mosquito species is unprecedented during this century and has heightened concern among public health and vector control officials because of the known and potential vector relationships of Ae. albopictus with several arboviruses. Photoperiod, temperature, rainfall, and humidity are major limiting factors affecting the range extension of Ae. albopictus. These are examined, along with previous distribution records of the closely related Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus), to identify general areas of the Mediterranean basin that might be suitable for colonization by Ae. albopictus. Finally, the results of vector competence studies, virus isolation tests of field-collected specimens, and feeding habits of Ae. albopictus are analyzed with a view toward assessing the potential of Ae. albopictus becoming involved in arbovirus cycles in Mediterranean countries. Mosquito-borne arboviruses of concern to the region include Sindbis, chikungunya, West Nile, dengue, Tahyna, Rift Valley fever, and Batai viruses. In addition, Israel turkey meningoencephalitis and African horse sickness viruses occur in the area and mosquito vectors may be involved in their transmission.

Broodstock were divided to two groups (A and B) of 6 and 7 individuals, respectively. They were caught in the sea and acclimatized to laboratory conditions for about seven months prior to spawning. Spawning lasted 65 days from April 8 to June 11 in group A, and 43 days from April 10 to May 22 in group B, within the temperature range between 13.5 and 21.3 degrees C. Numbers of buoyant and sunken eggs, fertilization rate of buoyant eggs and percentage of abnormally developed eggs were estimated daily. There was no correlation between water temperature at spawning and viable hatch, and between spawning period and viable hatch, at the same incubation temperature in all cases. The total number of eggs released during the spawning period was estimated at 18.1 million in group A and 10.8 million in group B.

J	STIEFEL, VL; NECHOLS, JR; MARGOLIES, DC				STIEFEL, VL; NECHOLS, JR; MARGOLIES, DC			OVERWINTERING BIOLOGY OF ANOMOEA-FLAVOKANSIENSIS (COLEOPTERA, CHRYSOMELIDAE)	ANNALS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												We investigated the type of winter dormancy used by Anomoea flavokansiensis Moldenke, a leaf beetle whose life history is poorly understood, by quantifying CO2 production of larvae reared under two photoperiods (16:8 [L:D] h and 10:14 [L:D] h) at an average temperature of 25 degrees C in the laboratory and from an overwintering population sampled from a field insectary in late autumn. We also determined whether larvae were able to overwinter in the field insectary. CO2 production by laboratory-reared larvae increased as larvae increased in size, but the amount of CO2 produced did not differ between photoperiods. CO2 production by larvae (head capsule widths of 0.59 +/- 0.03 mm) removed from the soil within the insectary (9 degrees C) on 14 December was similar to that of laboratory-reared larvae with the same range of head capsule widths. In addition, no larvae survived a 6-mo overwintering period in the insectary. Because CO2 production did not differ among larvae within die same head capsule width classes reared under different environmental conditions, including those that typically induce diapause in other arthropods, and because no larvae survived overwintering in the field insectary, we hypothesize that A. flavokansiensis overwinters in quiescence and that the larvae may do so as inquilines in ant nests, as has been shown for larvae of closely related genera.																	0013-8746					MAY	1995	88	3					342	347		10.1093/aesa/88.3.342								WOS:A1995QY12800011

However, it is not known if the conspicuous diversity in the distribution pattern of melatonin binding sites in these areas depicts differences in reproductive behavior observed in the seasonally breeding species in the temperate zones. We explored the distribution and the characteristics of melatonin binding sites in the hypothalamus and pituitary of three species (bovine, horse, and donkey) different in terms of seasonal reproductive competence. The topographical localization, investigated by in vitro autoradiography, revealed 2-[I-125]iodomelatonin binding sites only in the pituitary gland in all three species, primarily in the pars tuberalis (PT), but also in the pars distalis (PD) and pars intermedia (PI). Kinetic, inhibition, and saturation studies, performed by means of in vitro binding, revealed presence of a single class high affinity binding sites. The K-d values, melatonin, and 2-iodomelatonin K-i values were in the low picomolar range. Coincubation with GTP gamma S inhibited 2-[I-125]iodomelatonin binding, demonstrating that these putative receptors are linked to a G protein in their signal-transduction pathway. The hypothalamus was devoid of specific binding. In conclusion, the results suggest that in these species, the hypophysis may be a principal target for the melatonin action on the reproductive system.

J	WIPKING, W				WIPKING, W			INFLUENCES OF DAYLENGTH AND TEMPERATURE ON THE PERIOD OF DIAPAUSE AND ITS ENDING PROCESS IN DORMANT LARVAE OF BURNET MOTHS (LEPIDOPTERA, ZYGAENIDAE)	OECOLOGIA												The onset of larval diapause in the burnet moth Zygaena trifolii is clearly characterized by the larva molting into a specialized dormant morph. In a potentially bivoltine Mediterranean population (Marseille) two types of diapause can occur within 1 year: firstly, a facultative summer diapause of 3-10 weeks, and secondly, an obligate winter diapause, which can be lengthened by a period of thermal quiescence to several months in temperatures of less than or equal to 5 degrees C. For the first time, three successive physiological periods have been experimentally distinguised within an insect dormancy (between onset of diapause and molting to the next non-diapause stage), using chilling periods of 30-180 days at 5 degrees C, and varying conditions of photoperiod and temperature. These stages are: (1) a continuous diapause-ending process (DEP); (2) thermal quiescence (Q); and finally, (3) a period of post-diapause development (PDD) before molting to the next larval instar. The result of transferring dormant larvae from chilling at 5 degrees C to 20 degrees C depended on the length of the chilling period. After chilling for 120-180 days, molting to the next instar occurred after 6-10 days, independent of daylength. This period corresponds with the duration of PDD. After shorter chilling periods (90, 60, 30 days and the control, 0 days) the period to eclosion increased exponentially, and included both the latter part of the previous diapause process and the 6-10 day period of PDD. However, photoperiod also influences the time to eclosion after chilling. Short daylength (8 h light / 16 h dark: LD 8/16) lengthened the diapause in comparison to long daylength (16 h light / 8 h dark: LD 16/8). Short daylength had a similar effect during chilling at 5 degrees C, as measured by the longer time to eclosion after transfer. The shorter time to eclosion resulting from longer chilling periods (30-90 days) demonstrates that the state of diapause is continuously shortened at 5 degrees C, and corresponds to the neuroendocrine controlled DEP. Presumably the DEP has already started after the onset of diapause. When chilling was continued after the end of the DEP, which ranged between 90 and 120 days, thermal quiescence (Q) followed (observed maximum 395 days). Different photoperiodic conditions during the pre-diapause inductive period modified diapause intensity (measured as the duration of diapause), in that a photoperiodic signal just below the critical photoperiod for diapause induction (LD 15/9) intensified diapause. Experiments simulating the summer diapause showed that PDD occurred in the range of 10-25 degrees C. Higher temperatures (15 and 20 degrees C) shortened the DEP at LD 16/8, so that at 20 degrees C many individuals had already terminated diapause after 10-40 days and had molted after the 6-10 days of PDD. A temperature of 25 degrees C unexpectedly lengthened the DEP to 110 days in several individuals. The ecological consequences and the adaptive significance of variation in the duration of the diapause are discussed in relation to the persistence of local populations which, in a Mediterranean environment, encounter unpredictably variable and rare climatic extremes throughout the year.																	0029-8549					MAY	1995	102	2					202	210		10.1007/BF00333252								WOS:A1995QY66400010	28306875					
J	Chan, K				Chan, K			Comparative study of winter body composition of resident and migrant Grey-breasted Silvereyes	AUK												A comparative study of the winter body composition between resident and migrant birds was made on the partially migratory Tasmanian race of the Grey-breasted Silvereye (Zosterops I. lateralis). Each year some members migrate from Tasmania to winter on mainland sites, while other members remain in Tasmania year-round. Resident birds were those captured at Mt. Nelson, Tasmania, during midwinter; migrant birds were those captured during midwinter at Armidale, New South Wales, 1,500 km to the north. Nighttime winter temperatures at the two locations are very similar. both residents and migrants showed diurnal increases in lipid content, but not in other major body components. Despite differences in photoperiod and feeding conditions at the winter grounds, lipid content accumulated in the late afternoon was similar (8% of live body mass) for residents and migrants. Fractional differences in major body components between residents and migrants were negligible, being less than 0.01 in all cases. Therefore, body composition is not related to whether an individual bird is a resident or a migrant. Low night temperatures alone do not explain why the species migrate from Tasmania to places like Armidale in New South Wales. The birds could migrate for reasons such as better food conditions, higher daytime temperatures, and longer daylength for foraging on the mainland.

J	WILSON, LJ				WILSON, LJ			HABITATS OF 2-SPOTTED SPIDER-MITES (ACARI, TETRANYCHIDAE) DURING WINTER AND SPRING IN A COTTON-PRODUCING REGION OF AUSTRALIA	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												Winter and spring habitats of the twospotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch, were investigated to determine the source of mites infesting seedling cotton crops. The two possibilities were that mites may overwinter in diapause in the soil or litter of cotton fields or they may overwinter on suitable vegetation. Few mites were found in litter or soil collected from fallow cotton fields in winter. Significant numbers of diapause mites were found in litter at only 2 of 15 sites. ht one of these sites the abundance of mites in litter declined dramatically following cultivation. The cotton crops at these two sites were late maturing and, therefore, more mites may have been induced to diapause because of cooler temperatures, shorter days, and possibly lower food quality than at other sites where more typical, earlier maturing crops were grown. The contribution of mites that overwinter in the soil or litter of cotton fields to infestations on the subsequent cotton crop is not likely to be significant. Vegetation from within and From the borders of fallow cotton fields and from sites remote from cotton (>1-km distance) were examined for presence of mites in winter and spring. Remote sites were further classified as adjacent to permanent water (wet) or not (dry) Nondiapausing mites, actively feeding and reproducing, were Found on a wide range of plant species (37) in the vicinity of cotton fields in winter and spring Natural senescence of these plants in spring probably forces mites to disperse, often onto young cotton seedlings nearby resulting in a pronounced edge effect in cotton fields. Mite abundance on weeds was far lower Lit dg remote than at cotton sites, possibly caused by the lack of a continuous sequence of hosts. Mite abundance at wet remote sites was intermediate between cotton and dry remote sites, probably because they provide a continuity of hosts for mites. Management of the weeds on cotton farms through winter/spring could potentially reduce levels of mite infestation of cotton seedlings in the following season.

J	KENNEDY, AD				KENNEDY, AD			TEMPERATURE EFFECTS OF PASSIVE GREENHOUSE APPARATUS IN HIGH-LATITUDE CLIMATE-CHANGE EXPERIMENTS	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												1. Passive greenhouse apparatus is commonly used to investigate the in situ biological response of terrestrial communities to global warming. 2. Although close conformity of greenhouse treatment effects to general circulation model (GCM) scenarios is widely claimed, no proof of such a relationship has yet been published. 3. Here, the relationship between passive greenhouse thermal environment and future climate conditions is considered using temperature data collected from within and without greenhouses deployed in the maritime Antarctic. It is revealed that in terms of thermal extremes, diel and annual variation, and overall distribution across the temperature spectrum, such apparatus achieves only poor simulation of GCM forecasts. 4. During summer, greenhouses induce an amplified daily range of temperatures, elevated maxima and accelerated rates of change. 5. During spring and autumn, diel temperature variation continues inside the greenhouses while snow cover protects the controls. 6. During winter, an inverse treatment effect occurs, in which the relative depth of snow cover causes lower temperatures in greenhouses than in controls. 7. These treatment effects differ significantly from GCM climate predictions. Changes recorded in the composition, structure and function of greenhouse biota may thus be artefacts of the methodology. 8. Thorough a priori testing of greenhouse treatment effects is recommended for future climate change studies that are to be conducted in environments subject to seasonal snowfall, solar elevation and day length.																	0269-8463					APR	1995	9	2					340	350		10.2307/2390583								WOS:A1995QU91300026

Collecting focused on the relatively unstudied southeastern United States, although fruit collections as far north as Michigan and as far west as Texas were made. The known range of the blueberry maggot By has been extended west to the Ozark Plateau, and the fly is now known to be much more widely distributed in southeastern North America than previously thought. Although R. mendax infests many species of Vaccinium and Gaylussacia in the northernmost part of its range, in most of its range it infests almost exclusively V. stamineum (deerberry). The relatively inflexible diapause characteristics of R. mendax may contribute to this restriction in host plant usage.																	0022-8567					APR	1995	68	2					133	142										WOS:A1995RQ28300002

In this species, geographic variation is found in the percentage of parasitoids entering diapause and in the sex ratio of emerging parasitoids. Percentage diapause appears to be influenced by host species (more parasitoids enter diapause in D. melanogaster Meigen than in D. subobscura Collin) and temperature. It is not correlated with any of the abiotic factors investigated, but is correlated with survival probability in D. melanogaster larvae and with the time of year in which the experiment was conducted (even though none of the parasitoids experienced natural day light). Sex ratio was only found to correlate with percentage diapause, suggesting that males enter diapause more frequently than females. It is concluded that A. tabida uses diapause to survive both unfavourable abiotic and biotic circumstances.																	0013-8703					MAR	1995	74	3					259	265		10.1111/j.1570-7458.1995.tb01899.x								WOS:A1995QU36100009

Helophorus orientalis and H. lacustris predominated. Three types of univoltine life cycles occurred: (1) adults overwinter in terrestrial habitats and larvae complete development in riparian habitats from early summer to early autumn, depending on the species; (2) the same as type 1, except eggs and a few adults overwinter; (3) larvae, pupae, and/or recently emerged adults overwinter and teneral adults occur in aquatic habitats in early spring. Nine species of Hydrochus (Hydrochinae) were found among 6,278 adults, with H. squamifer predominating. All had a similar univoltine life cycle in which adults overwinter in terrestrial habitats and enter aquatic sites in spring; larvae complete development in riparian habitats from late spring to late summer, depending on the species. Eight species and 5,167 adults Berosus (Hydrophilinae: Berosini) occurred, with B. striatus predominating; their univoltine life cycles varied greatly among species. Some species overwinter as diapausing eggs (B. aculeatus, B. peregrinus, B. stylifer), others as adults in terrestrial habitats (B. pantherinus, B. striatus), one as aquatic larvae (B. hatchi), and another as adults and larvae (B. fraternus). Only 35 Hydraenidae adults were collected; included were Hydraena angulicollis, H. pennsylvanica, and Ochthebius lineatus. A generic key to aquatic Hydrophilidae adults and keys to species of Helophorus, Hydrochus, Berosus, and Hydraenidae in Wisconsin are provided.

J	PILASTRO, A; BERTORELLE, G; MARIN, G				PILASTRO, A; BERTORELLE, G; MARIN, G			WINTER FATTENING STRATEGIES OF 2 PASSERINE SPECIES - ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL INFLUENCES	JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY												We studied the fattening strategies of two insectivorous passerines, the Robin Erithacus rubecula and the Wren Troglodytes troglodytes, during their wintering stage in a study area of the eastern Po valley (Northern Italy). We analysed the relationship between some environmental (temperature, photoperiod, rainfall) and social factors (density of migrant competitors, territoriality, home range size) on the one hand, and levels of fat reserve on the other. Although average body fat depots differed between the two species, both increased their daily fat stores as the photoperiod shortened with the progress of winter. The amount of fat accumulated by day was more than that required for overnight consumption. Both species also responded to short-term variations in weather conditions: fat depots were inversely related to the maximum temperature on the day of capture. The use of space and the social structure of the wintering populations seem to affect fattening strategies: fat reserves of resident Robins were negatively related to the density of conspecific migrants, early in the season. The same relationship was not observed for Wrens, which were dispersed in extensively overlapping home-ranges. In this species, the home-range size was positively, and fat reserves negatively, correlated with the body size of the bird.

Larval developmental time and adult scutum length decreased as a function of increasing rearing temperature. In northern populations at 20 degrees C, larval developmental time was shorter in short-day than in long-day conditions. Females of tropical and subarctic populations remained autogenous under different conditions and produced many autogenous eggs in the first batch. In subtropical and temperate populations, the percentage of autogenous females varied from 0 to 100%, being highest at low temperature and short-day condition. A correlation analysis of population traits indicated that the autogeny rate was correlated positively with larval developmental time and the number of eggs per autogenous female. The life-history traits did not show a simple clinal gradient over mean annual temperature of the locality of origin, except that adult scutum length decreased with an increase in mean temperature. A principal components analysis for female life-history traits revealed a continuous latitudinal change from temperate to tropical populations: populations at low latitudes were small in adult size and more autogenous. Subarctic populations showed a departure from this trend, having large adult size but high autogeny rate.																	0022-2585					MAR	1995	32	2					181	189		10.1093/jmedent/32.2.181								WOS:A1995QJ93700015	7608925

Tropical and temperate Ae. albopictus eggs were tested under different diapause and cold acclimation conditions. Temperate Ae. albopictus eggs had a lower lethal temperature than tropical Ae. albopictus eggs. Diapause and cold acclimation decreased the lower lethal temperatures of temperate eggs. However, neither diapause, cold acclimation, nor geographic origin affected Ae. albopictus egg supercooling points. All lower lethal temperatures were above -13 degrees C and all supercooling points were below -26 degrees C, indicating prefreeze mortality.

Larvae burrow in the substratum of the stream, living under small to large cobbles that are firmly embedded in the stream bottom. Euthyplocia hecuba is sexually dimorphic and one of the largest mayflies of Central America, with maximum larval size of 149 mg (dry mass) for females and 35 mg for males. Mature female and male larvae are about 40% larger in Q. Marilin relative to R. Tempisquito. Subimagoes emerge about 1 h before dawn (similar to 0400 h); the molt to the image (or true adult stage) occurs similar to 20 min later. Adult emergence and reproduction occurs mainly between June and November. Females mate and then oviposit in riffle areas just before dawn, with the time period gradually changing from 0446 and 0507 h in June to 0508 and 0529 h in October. We found that size of adult males and females gradually declined during the emergence period. Fecundity averaged 984 in October (range 364-2851), with eggs being very large for a mayfly(0.46 x 0.4 mm; 0.017 mg dry mass). The proportion of adult biomass allocated to eggs (reproductive effort) averaged 0.51 but varied according to female size. Median egg development time was 113, 55, and 31 d at 15, 20, and 25 degrees C. The hatch success of eggs was >90% at 15 and 20 degrees C, only 68% at 25 degrees C, and 0% at 10 and 30 degrees C. First instar larvae are relatively large for a mayfly, having a head width of 0.11 mm and a body length of 1.30 mm. Seasonal changes in larval size distribution suggest that larval development takes similar to 22 mo to complete and may involve a developmental quiescence or diapause during the first year. A 2-yr life history appears to be the most parsimonious hypothesis given a 2-mo egg development time, the occurrence of two size cohorts of larvae throughout most of the year, and the temporal pattern of maximum and average larval sizes over the course of the sampling period. Our data suggest that seasonality in the developmental dynamics of larvae underlies both the seasonal emergence and decline in dry mass of both adult males and females during the emergence period. The data provide the first evidence for semivoltinism in a tropical mayfly.																	0887-3593					MAR	1995	14	1					131	146		10.2307/1467729								WOS:A1995QQ80800012

Seventeen OP populations and 2 inbreds of contrasting daylength response [termed by convention as long (LD) and short (SD) day], 1 shallot (A. cepa var. ascalonicum), and one cultivar of bunching onion (Allium fistulosum) were examined with 104 cDNA clones and two to four restriction enzymes. Sixty (58%) clones detected at least 1 polymorphic fragment scorable among the OP populations and were used for analyses. The average number of polymorphic fragments per polymorphic probe-enzyme combination was 1.9, reflecting that numerous monomorphic fragments were usually present. Similarities were estimated as the proportion of polymorphic fragments shared by 2 populations. Average similarity values among LD, among SD, and between LD and SD OP populations were 0.79, 0.67, and 0.68, respectively. Relationships among the OP populations were estimated by parsimony, cluster analysis of similarities using the unweighted-pair-group method (UPGMA), and multivariate analysis using principle components. Parsimony analysis generated a strict consensus tree that grouped all but 1 LD onion with unresolved relationships to the SD OP populations. The UPGMA analysis placed together the LD storage OP populations. Principal component analysis grouped all but 2 LD onions; the other OP populations were dispersed. The results suggest that LD and SD onions do not represent distinct germ plasm, but that LD storage onions represent a derived group selected for production at higher latitudes. If it is assumed that the sampled populations are representative of all onion OP populations, the lower similarities among SD OP populations indicate that their collection and maintenance in germ plasm collections is important for the preservation of genetic diversity.																	0040-5752					MAR	1995	90	3-4					407	414										WOS:A1995QR66400015	24173931

The larva overwinters within a ball gall on the stem of goldenrod Solidago spp. The galls often extend above the snowpack, exposing the larva to a wide range of environmental extremes in winter. This species has received extensive attention as a freeze-tolerant insect model. A seasonal study of the overwintering bioenergetics of an Ohio, USA, population revealed marked decreases in body weight, lipid and total caloric content in October and November when environmental temperatures were the highest. Overwintering larvae produce heat shock proteins in response to high-temperature exposure. However, unlike other insects E. solidaginis does not appear to synthesize heat shock proteins in response to low-temperature exposure.																	0936-577X					FEB 23	1995	5	1					61	67		10.3354/cr005061								WOS:A1995RQ20800008

The cones were incubated in a controlled environment chamber and the emerging insects were collected and identified. This analysis excludes parasitoids except for the most abundant Torymus spp. Twelve insect species and some 14000 individuals in total were identified. On the average, every cone was inhabited by three insects. The most numerous species were Kaltenbachiola strobi (Winn.), Cydia strobilella (L.), and Torymus spp., amounting together to 95% of the total insect number. Though the abundance peaks varied for different species, most insects were reared from cones from the alpine area. Vegetation type (alliance) was related to the abundance of several species but did not correlate with total infestation rate. For two species their number was related to sampling site altitude. Likewise, a positive, linear correlation was found between the frequencies of the parasitoid Torymus spp. and its host K. strobi, the ratio between the two species averaging 0.7. Cone setting did not correlate with infestation level, but tree age was positively related to total insect number per cone. In the laboratory C. strobilella and K. strobi were the earliest species to emerge; they had the shortest emergence period as well. The percentage of K. strobi with prolonged diapause (emergence in second year after cone sampling) was 51%, while the corresponding values for all other species were lower than 20%. Neither sampling site elevation nor cone setting affected diapause length.

EFFECT OF INBREEDING ON DIAPAUSE	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY-ZEITSCHRIFT FUR ANGEWANDTE ENTOMOLOGIE												Experiments were undertaken in 1990 and 1992 to prove the effect of consanguinity on diapause and to study its links with sex determinism and possible genetic factors. These experiments were realized on the progenies of colonies collected in Fontainebleau forest. From adult emergences in April different ways of breeding were comparatively carried out during two generations: inbred brother-sister crosses, non-inbred crosses with insects from another origin, in particular with a reference rearing strain reared for many generations; and breedings of virgin females. The progenies of these crossings were reared in the same standard laboratory conditions favourable to development without diapause (16 degrees C, 15 h L-9 h D photoperiod for the young larvae, 20 degrees C, 16 h 30 L-7 h 30 D thereafter). Diapause rates and sex-ratio were simultaneously observed. The results show an important increase in diapause rates and male rates in the progenies of inbred insects. We also found a link between sex and diapause, its rates being higher in males. On the other hand, crossings with the rearing strain corroborate the existence of a genetic factor strengthening diapause which would be eliminated in reared populations if only the without diapause insects are bred from generation to generation. Some hypotheses about the interaction between consanguinity, sex determinisms and the existence of this genetic factor are drawn from these results. It is suggested that these phenomena may have a noticeable importance for population dynamics ofD. pini.																	0931-2048					FEB	1995	119	1					35	43		10.1111/j.1439-0418.1995.tb01240.x								WOS:A1995QT92100006

A general model of an annual reproductive cycle is developed and presented in two forms for semelparous and iteroparous organisms. 2. In the model a fixed period for spawning implies a fixed phase relationship between all components of the cycle and those external variables with an annual component. Causal relationships cannot be established by observations of concurence. 3. The physiological basis of causal relationship is being established for a number of marine invertebrate groups and some polychaete case histories are reviewed. 4. An important role for endogenous timing mechanisms that interact with external variables including temperature but also seasonal photoperiod and other factors is established. 5. An increase in mean sea temperature would cause a change in the temperature phase relationships of annual reproductive cycles when photoperiod has a significant role in the timing mechanism. 6. Local variation in the responses to environmental signals are expected in populations in different parts of the geographical range. Gene flow would provide a mechanism by which populations would respond to reductions of fitness arising from the changed phase relationships that are implied by global warming.																	0306-4565					FEB-MAY	1995	20	1-2					79	90		10.1016/0306-4565(94)00030-M								WOS:A1995QL61000010

To better understand fat cycling in this model, we obtained plasma and gluteal adipose tissue from five captive adult bears at approximately 20-day intervals from October 1 1992 through March 31 1993. The study included a predenning and denning period for each animal. Sampling during the predenning period followed a 12-h fast. Bears were anorectic while denning. Adipose LPL activities and plasma insulin concentrations were determined for each time point. Predenning LPL activities (4.83 +/- 0.64 mu mol/h/g) were significantly greater than those seen during the denning period (1.82 +/- 0.65, p < 0.001). A biphasic pattern of fasting LPL activity was seen in four of the five bears during the predenning period. Fasting insulin concentrations showed no such pattern of variation during the study period (mean = 25.1 +/- 1.36 pmol/l; range 1.1-6.0). We found no evidence of a linear relationship between LPL activity and insulin levels (p = 0.139). Neither LPL activity nor insulin concentrations were related to changes in weight (p = 0.257 and p = 0.7104, respectively). We conclude that LPL activity can be measured in black bear adipose tissue and that fall (predenning) activities are significantly higher than those seen during the winter (denning period). Furthermore, the seasonal regulation of LPL involves some factor(s) in addition to insulin.																	0031-9384					FEB	1995	57	2					271	275		10.1016/0031-9384(94)00246-2								WOS:A1995QC52300011	7716203					
J	OBA, G				OBA, G			THE EFFECTS OF CONTROLLED GRAZING ON PHYTOMASS DYNAMICS OF THE DWARF SHRUB INDIGOFERA-SPINOSA IN ARID KENYA	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Conventional range rehabilitation methods use controlled grazing, followed by assessments of either species composition, cover or phytomass dynamics. We compared effects of controlled and free grazing on the dynamics of live (current year's and preceding years' crops), standing dead and litter fraction of the dwarf shrub Indigofera spinosa (Forsk.) Mathew between 1986 and 1990, on arid range of North-West Kenya. Except for standing dead fraction and litter mass, live phytomass fractions varied significantly between growth and dormancy months in the two treatments. Generally, phytomass fractions exhibited disappearance in grazed plots, while it was accumulated in control plots. The control, however, achieved greater phytomass turnover (50.1 +/- 15.8% Yr(-1)) than grazed plots (34.4 +/- 6.0% Yr(-1)). The results showed that browsing when combined with declining rainfall, increased depreciation of forage yield, while above-average rainfall enhanced greater phytomass production. Given the rapid recovery potential by the shrub, declining trends of live fractions in grazed plots were unlikely to be permanent but fluctuate between periods of favourable rainfall and drought. The relationship between total monthly rainfall, cumulative rainfall of the current and the preceding months and the current year's crop, respectively, was explained by correlation coefficient (r) of 0.23-0.30 in control plots and 0.43-0.65 in grazed plots (<0.05). Daily green dry matter productivity and rainfall use efficiency (RUE) of I. spinosa improved when rain storm events were closely sequenced and spread over growth months. On this arid range, dwarf shrub litter production showed constancy, while standing dead fraction increased by about 900% in control plots and declined by 40% in grazed. Accumulation of standing dead phytomass fraction in control plots portrayed a deteriorating forage condition. Given that I. spinosa is highly adapted to herbivory, deferral of over-browsed shrubs should be limited to no more than 1-2 growth seasons. The paper discusses management implications of the findings.																	1146-609X						1995	16	1					31	54										WOS:A1995RR76500003

We tested the hypothesis that temperatures characteristic of the microenvironment under P. glandulosa enhance seed germination and seedling growth of C. pallida and inhibit germination and seedling growth of Acacia smallii. Soil temperatures beneath P. glandulosa individuals and in adjacent herb-dominated interspaces between canopies and effects of interspace and canopy temperatures on germination and seedling growth of the 2 shrub species were determined. Greatest germination of C. pallida seeds occurred at temperatures (25 and 30 degrees C) within the range of mean monthly soil temperatures (25 +/- 0.3 to 31 +/- 5 degrees C, (x) over bar +/- SD) under P, glandulosa during May and June, the peak period of seedling emergence in the field, Exposing unimbibed C. pallida seeds to 50 degrees C, similar to maximum temperatures (49 +/- 6 degrees C) beneath canopies during the peak period of C. pallida seed dispersal by birds during July and August, increased germination 62%. Aggregation of C. pallida beneath P. glandulosa may occur in part because birds disperse seeds beneath P, glandulosa where maximum summer temperatures reduce seed dormancy and mean May-June temperatures favor germination. Absence of C. pallida in interspaces may result in parr from lack of dispersal by birds and inhibition of germination by high temperatures characteristic of interspaces.																	1146-609X						1995	16	5					621	632										WOS:A1995UA35100009

Hydrocarbons from the puparia of both diapausing and nondiapausing individuals are saturated and range in chain length from 25 to 33 carbons. GC-MS analyses indicate that the hydrocarbon fraction contains n-, terminally and internally branched monomethyl-, and 3,x-, 5,x- and internally branched dimethylalkanes. The diapausing and nondiapausing empty puparia contained 39.4 and 42.9% n-alkanes, 46.5 and 44.7% monomethylalkanes, and 9.5 and 8.5% dimethylalkanes, respectively. No major differences in the percent composition of the different hydrocarbons were noted between the two groups. This suggests that the amount of hydrocarbon, rather than the composition, contributes to the lower transpiration rates observed in diapausing pupae.

The seasonal patterns of spider activity revealed by the two methods were very different. The suction trap catches overall had a peak at the end of the summer and low catches in early spring and autumn. The wire catches in the field layer showed two maxima, one in early spring and one in autumn. These findings are interpreted to mean that gossamer dispersing spiders tend to reach high in the air in the warm season, and disperse close to the ground in spring and autumn. Summer aeronautic activity seems to have potential for long-range migration between breeding habitats, whereas autumn and spring movements may have evolved as short-distance migrations in which the same individuals first move from breeding to hibernation habitat, then from hibernation to new breeding habitat.																	0065-1354		87-7288-492-4				1995	70	2					257	268										WOS:A1995BH94E00022

In addition, its diapause induction and its coldhardiness were compared with those of the target host M. configurata and its native tachinid parasitoid, Athrycia cinerea (Coq.). E, consobrina was found to fit criteria Soi a successful biocontrol agent reasonably well. It also had the potential to fill a largely unoccupied niche in the parasitoid complex of M. configurata. E. consobrina has a facultative diapause of the long-day type, similar to A. cinerea, but is less sensitive to diapause-inducing conditions. E. consobrina is at least as coldhardy as A. cinerea and more coldhardy than M. configurata. Laboratory exposures to temperatures of 0 degrees C for 140 days apparently selected for greater coldhardiness, and later generations survived exposures of 140 days at - 15 degrees C without significant mortality. Adult E. consobrina were released at three locations in Manitoba in 1986 and 1987, but establishment has not been confirmed.																	0958-3157						1995	5	1					55	67		10.1080/09583159550040015								WOS:A1995RC97800005

Oviposition continues irrespective of day length, but stops almost completely when the mean temperature drops below 15 degrees C (beginning in December). During winter months, the outdoor females enter reproductive diapause, and resume oviposition in during March and April. All first instar nymphs die at low temperatures, whereas approximately 20% of the nymphs of later instars may survive and mature. Dense populations of the western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis, develop outdoors in Israel about a month before the peak in population of O. albidipennis, and have the opportunity to cause much damage. Since the Israeli O. albidipennis does not enter diapause under short day photophase, it might be an efficient predator of F. occidentalis in greenhouses in countries of northern latitude.																	0958-3157						1995	5	3					287	296		10.1080/09583159550039747								WOS:A1995TB47200004

We raised offspring of two field-caught populations from each of three latitudes in a common laboratory environment at 20 degrees C and two photoperiods. Nearly all Quebec (PQ) individuals (ca. 46 degrees N) entered diapause to reproduce the following spring (univoltine life cycle), while intermediate proportions of New York (NY; ca. 43 degrees N) and New Jersey (NJ; ca. 41 degrees N) individuals reproduced directly, producing a second generation (bivoltine life cycle). PQ females were smaller, developed faster, and laid smaller eggs than NY and NJ individuals; NY and NJ populations differed little in these variables. NY females had longer life spans than either PQ or NJ females, but lower oviposition rates. Total reproductive output did not differ across latitudes. Photoperiod affected body length, development time, and reproductive pathway, resulting in a latitutide by environment interaction. PQ individuals reproduced directly under 15L:9D (summer) conditions only, while the NY and NJ populations exhibited more direct reproduction under 13L:11D (spring or fall) conditions. Some life history characters of the NY and NJ populations displayed the higher variability indicative of phenological transition zones. These results indicate local adaptation of populations to long-term climatic patterns. Water striders appear to adapt to longer seasons by extending development, growing larger, and breeding directly. Larger body size and extended or rapid development are associated with bivoltinism and increases in egg size, but not necessarily with higher fecundity or oviposition rate. The phenological transition zone appears to be unrelated to a transition zone a little further south established by allozyme data and morphology, as all populations studied here could be electrophoretically identified as the northern ''type''.																	1010-061X					JAN	1995	8	1					21	41		10.1046/j.1420-9101.1995.8010021.x								WOS:A1995QQ78900004

Substrates consisted of separate samples of 2 cool season mid-grasses, western wheatgrass (Agropyron smithii Rydb.) and Japanese brome (Bromus japonicus Thunb.), and a mixture of warm season shortgrasses, buffalograss (Bunchloe dactyloids [Nutt.] Engelm.), and blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis [H.B.K.] Lag. ex Steud.), hand clipped from standing forage in mid-March. Isonitrogenous treatments included buffer containing urea with or without amino acids, branched-chain volatile fatty acids, sodium sulfate, or starch. Urea increased (P<0.05) in vitro dry matter disappearance and in vitro neutral detergent fiber disappearance of the cool season grasses over N free buffer. Methionine addition increased (P<0.05) in vitro neutral detergent fiber disappearance and rate of fermentation of both cool season grasses and in vitro dry matter disappearance of Japanese brome over urea alone. Sodium sulfate increased (P<0.05) in vitro neutral detergent fiber disappearance of Japanese brome compared to urea alone. None of the branched-chain volatile fatty acids tested increased dry matter disappearance, neutral detergent fiber disappearance, or rate of fermentation of the dormant range grasses. Addition of urea or amino acids did not increase in vitro dry matter disappearance or in vitro neutral detergent fiber disappearance of the short-grass mixture. In vitro screening of amino acid and branched-chain volatile fatty acid buffer additions to dormant range grasses showed that methionine supplementation with urea offers the greatest potential, among the supplements evaluated, for improving digestibility and rate of fermentation of cool season grasses. None of the buffer supplements improved fermentation of the warm season grasses.																	0022-409X					JAN	1995	48	1					39	44		10.2307/4002502								WOS:A1995QA49600005

Only one species of Phasia was detected, P. robertsonii Townsend); this species has been known by several other names, but most publications refer to it as Alophorella aeneoventris (Williston). P. robertsonii was reared from six species of mirids (ranked by parasitism level): Leproprema dolabrara (L.) (1.8%), Lygus lineolaris (Palisot) (0.6%), Megaloceroea recticornis (Geoffroy) (0.4%), Stenotus binotatus (F.) (0.2%), Trigonotylus coelestialium (Kirkaidy) (0.2%), and Adelphocoris lineolatus (Goeze) (0.1%). Five of these host records have not been reported before, and represent a wide variety of hosts-grass and legume feeders, univoltine to poly-voltine species, and immigrant as well as native mirids. The significance of this broad host range is discussed, including its relation to the low parasitism rates observed in this study and others. P. robertsonii had two generations per year in northwestern New Jersey, the first mainly in June and mostly on grass-feeding mirids, and the second exclusively on Lygus in October. No pupal diapause was detected, but parasite larvae may overwinter inside Lygus adults. The very Low parasitism rates indicate that tachinids provide little or no population suppression of the six mirid species studied.																	0028-7199					JAN	1995	103	1					100	106										WOS:A1995TP95900011

Over a two year period, the rate of shoot extension of T. fluminensis in a New Zealand mixed mahoe (Melicytus ramiflorus) coastal forest remnant showed a similar pattern to monthly mean values for mean daily air temperature and day length. Growth at the shoot apex was balanced by death at the shoot base. During the first year, nitrate (NO3-)content of the plant in the field was always > 250 mu mol g(-1) dry weight. On high NO3- supply in pot experiments, in a glasshouse or outdoors, total plant dry weight increased with increased relative irradiance from 1 to 30-50% (open ground photosynthetically active radiation = 100% relative irradiance). Changes in shoot to root dry weight ratio (S:R), specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf chlorophyll, carotenoid and protein content associated with decreased irradiance from 50 to 1% were similar to those associated with increased distance into the forest remnant and are discussed in relation to shade acclimation. Values for S:R (>30.1) and SLA (approximate to 900 cm(2) g(-1) dry weight) were extremely high at low irradiance. These results support earlier conclusions that irradiance level is likely to be the primary factor limiting the extent of colonisation of forest remnants by T. fluminensis. Under glasshouse conditions, the growth response of T. fluminensis to different ammonium and NOS concentrations was similar to that previously reported for herbaceous species capable of rapid growth. Leaf nitrate reductase activity was within the range previously reported for fast growing species. Tradescantia fluminensis accumulated substantial amounts of NO3- in shoots with no depression in growth. This NO3- was utilised when nitrogen became limiting to growth. An 'invasion strategy' of T. fluminensis into N.Z. native forest remnants is proposed.

J	COCKREM, JF				COCKREM, JF			TIMING OF SEASONAL BREEDING IN BIRDS, WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO NEW-ZEALAND BIRDS	REPRODUCTION FERTILITY AND DEVELOPMENT												A model to explain the timing of seasonal breeding in birds is presented. It is assumed that, despite the wide range in egg-laying seasons, there are common physiological mechanisms which underlie seasonality in birds and that most, if not all, birds are photoperiodic. Birds are considered to possess an internal rhythm of reproduction which is synchronized with seasonal changes in the environment by external factors, particularly the annual cycle of daylength. The rhythm consists, at least in part, of regular changes in the photoperiodic response between states of photosensitivity and photorefractoriness. Avian breeding seasons effectively start in autumn when birds become photosensitive, regardless of when egg-laying occurs. The timing of breeding is then influenced by the rate of increase of hypothalamic 'drive' and by the sensitivity of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland to inhibitory feedback from gonadal steroids. If sensitivity is high, gonadal growth will not occur until the threshold daylength for photostimulation is exceeded after the winter solstice. Egg-laying then starts in late winter, spring or summer. Alternatively, steroid feedback may be relatively low and gonadal growth may be sufficiently rapid once the birds become photosensitive that breeding occurs in late autumn or winter. The time of egg-laying in birds may also be strongly influenced by supplementary information, such as social cues, food availability, temperature and rainfall and, in some species, this information is more important than daylength in determining the timing of breeding. The review also includes the first summary of the breeding seasons of New Zealand birds. The pattern of egg-laying is exactly the same in native birds, in birds introduced to New Zealand and in other Southern hemisphere birds from similar latitudes, with a broad peak of egg-laying occurring from September to December. In addition, annual cycles of steroid hormone concentrations in the North Island brown kiwi, the yellow-eyed penguin and the kakapo are consistent with results from many studies on Northern hemisphere birds. This model for the timing of breeding in birds can be applied to New Zealand birds and it is concluded that the physiological control mechanisms for the timing of seasonal breeding in New Zealand birds are similar to those of other birds.

J	Martin, GB				Martin, GB			Reproductive research on farm animals for Australia - Some long-distance goals	REPRODUCTION FERTILITY AND DEVELOPMENT					25th Anniversary Symposium of the Australian-Society-for-Reproductive-Biology	SEP, 1994	BRISBANE, AUSTRALIA	Austr Soc Reprod Biol				In Australia, much of the research on the reproduction of farm animals has emphasised the technological manipulation of the reproductive tract, gametes and embryos. However, most of the animal production in Australia is still based on sheep and beef cattle enterprises that are managed on an extensive scale; the managers need technologies that can be easily and cheaply implemented on a large scale, and that are aimed at extensive control rather than intensive manipulation. For example, for synchronizing oestrus in the wool flocks the 'ram effect' has, and probably always will have, far more impact on extensive grazing systems than technologies based on exogenous prostaglandins or progestagens. This can also apply to the newer animal industries (such as emu farming), to human problems (such as population control), and to environmental problems (such as control of feral animals). Moreover, under the pressure of public opinion, the industries that are currently intensive are going 'free range'. In addition, surgical managerial tools (such as castration) will probably have to be abandoned or replaced. To cope with such profound influences, new types of reproductive management systems will be needed. This paper is an attempt to broaden our research horizons by developing the concept of 'control systems technologies', aimed at controlling reproductive performance rather than simply improving it. Ideas for such technologies already exist and are evident in the responses to environmental factors that our farm animals developed under the pressure of natural selection (before domestication). Stress, nutrition, photoperiod, lactation, and socio-sexual cues (e.g. pheromones) can all exert profound effects on reproductive activity. We already have a good grasp of the final common pathway through which the brain responses to these factors affect gonadal activity, namely the hypothalamic system that generates pulses of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone. All we need to do is learn how the major environmental cues exert their impact on the systems that control the final common pathway. When we understand them, we shall be able to manipulate them. This is not too speculative; we already have several technologies that take advantage of this approach, including steroid-based contraceptives, the 'ram effect', a vaccine-based antifertility treatment for rangeland cattle and the melatonin formulation used to control seasonal breeding in sheep.

J	vonWuehlisch, G; Krusche, D; Muhs, HJ				vonWuehlisch, G; Krusche, D; Muhs, HJ			Variation in temperature sum requirement for flushing of beech provenances	SILVAE GENETICA												The time of bud-burst of provenances of beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) is important especially on sites with frequently occurring late frosts. On a field trial in the nursery of the Institute of Forest Genetics at Grosshansdorf, Germany, the time of bud-burst was scored in 2 different ways on 158 3 year old provenances representing most part of the natural distribution of beech. Also the air temperatures were logged to calculate temperature sums at the time of bud-burst. A dine became evident with provenances from the east and south-eastern part of the range of distribution to flush early and provenances of the western part of the range to flush late. Also provenances from higher elevations tend to burst bud earlier than those from lower elevations. At a base temperature of 5 degrees C starting from January Ist early flushing provenances require 8,500 degree hours for bud-burst whereas late flushing provenances require 11,000 degree hours. Averagely 9,750 degree hours were required for bud-burst. The first single trees to flush required 7,600, the last 14,750 degree hours before bursting bud. According to the local risk of late frost occurrence during the period when the freshly flushing beech leaves are prone to frost it can be predicted which provenances could be potentially planted without late frost risk at a certain site and for which the late frost risk is too high.																	0037-5349						1995	44	5-6					343	346										WOS:A1995UF16400019						
J	RITKE, ME; LESSMAN, CA				RITKE, ME; LESSMAN, CA			LONGITUDINAL-STUDY OF OVARIAN DYNAMICS IN FEMALE GRAY TREEFROGS (HYLA-CHRYSOSCELIS)	COPEIA												Biopsies were performed to study the ovarian dynamics of a breeding population of free-living female gray treefrogs, Hyla chrysoscelis, in western Tennessee. This study used a longitudinal design in which individual females were biopsied up to four separate times in the same breeding season. All of the postspawning ovaries (n = 149) contained a series of enlarged follicles (mean follicle diameter = 0.305 mm), a condition that apparently facilitates repeated spawning during a prolonged breeding season. The size-frequency distribution of follicles remaining in the ovary after spawning was similar among all females (unimodal between 0.10 and 0.30 mm diameter) indicating that vitellogenic growth of this pool of follicles is slowed or arrested while another series of larger follicles (those that will comprise the next clutch) nears maturation. The average size of the follicles remaining in the ovary after spawning was not correlated with female body size, clutch number, time (month) during the breeding season, the number of days since last oviposition, or the number of days it took females to oviposit their next clutch. Thus, the ability to oviposit more than one clutch in a breeding season may depend primarily on the foraging success of females, an idea supported by the observation that fat bodies were generally not available as an energy source for the production of multiple clutches after the start of the breeding season. Ovarian biopsies performed in Nov. on captive frogs indicated that females may enter winter dormancy with or without enlarged ovaries, a condition that may also depend on the nutritional condition of the female.

Pineal glands from four northern elephant seal pups, estimated age less than 1 week, weighed 3.0+/-0.80 g, which was significantly less than that previously found in southern elephant seals (4.6+/-0.35 g). Midday concentrations of plasma melatonin in pups averaged more than 3000 pmol/l in the first 5 days post-partum, but declined rapidly to less than 400 pmol/l after day 9. Daytime melatonin levels in northern elephant seals tended to be lower than in southern elephant seals, although they were very high compared with other species. A circadian cycle of plasma melatonin concentration was observed in newborn northern elephant seals, with levels of 3000-5000 pmol/l during the day, rising to more than 10,000 pmol/l late in the dark phase. Soon after weaning at 4 weeks of age, daytime and night-time levels were in the range 60-100 pmol/l and 100-400 pmol/l, respectively. When approximately 10 weeks old, most samples were in the range 100-400 pmol/l with no discernible difference between day and night levels. The results do not support the hypothesis that the pineal gland is involved in thermogenesis in new-born southern elephant seals. Instead, the very active pineal gland may contribute to energy conservation, by lowering body temperature, particularly at night. As physical insulation is acquired by the deposition of blubber, the mechanism is not required and melatonin falls to adult levels.

In wing-dimorphic species, their influence on habitat quality, and on rates of development of the migrant itself, maintains variation in responses to environmental cues determining wing-form and migratory behaviour. Migrants flying above their flight boundary layer rely on winds to disperse them across landscapes in which their habitats are distributed. Patterns of distribution of habitat patches, and the influence of changing windspeeds and direction on the displacements of migrants, result in selection for variation in migratory potential at each migration. In subsequent migrations, this variation and stochastic effects of the winds on groundtracks of individual migrants ensure that their destinations 'sample' the landscapes they travel over. The extent and resolution of this sampling, by which migrants reach favourable habitats, depend on the components of migratory potential, their mode of inheritance, and genetic correlations between them, as well as on the characteristics of the winds on which they travel.																	0034-5466					DEC	1994	36	2					165	171		10.1007/BF02514932								WOS:A1994QP56200007

In previous work, however, we have shown that quiescence-the readily reversible cessation of development in direct response to contemporaneous environmental conditions-acting alone and independent of stage development cannot yield synchronization. Here we demonstrate how stage-specific quiescence(SSq), with stage dependence based solely on developmental thresholds that differ among stages, is generally sufficient to synchronize semelparous life cycles to seasons. We present an example consistent with this mechanism, compare SSQ with mechanisms based on diapause, and propose some testable hypotheses. Finally, we indicate additional empirical and theoretical work needed to evaluate the applicability of SSQ and its close relatives to a potentially wide range of organisms.

One group (Control group) was held under light conditions simulating the natural light regime of their moulting grounds at 66 degrees N latitude. The light regime of another group (Shifted group) was similar to the Control group, but shifted 1 month forward, simulating light conditions further into autumn. All birds had food ad libitum. In addition, comparisons were made with free-living bluethroats. There were no differences in moult performance (start and speed) between the Control group and the Shifted group, and moult was similar to that of free-living birds. The start of moult may be endogenously controlled and set earlier in the season so the change in light regime for the Shifted group may have come too late to influence moult performance. The rate of moult may also be inflexible, in spite of the imposed time stress. In addition, bluethroats may moult so fast that further acceleration would hamper flight manoeuvrability and feeding efficiency. Whereas the Control group birds first started to deposit fat when moult was finished, as free-living birds do, the Shifted group birds started fat deposition in mid-moult. Also, the fat deposition rate following completion of moult was higher in the Shifted group. Thus, adult bluethroats can adjust the timing and speed of fat deposition in relation to moult and time of season. Such flexibility should be advantageous for migratory birds moulting at high latitudes where time available between breeding and migration is short.																	0003-3472					NOV	1994	48	5					1173	1181		10.1006/anbe.1994.1349								WOS:A1994PQ35100018

The critical daylength varied among the geographic strains, about 13 h in the ON (originated from Onuma, 42-degrees-N), 12 h in the OI (Oita, 33.2-degrees-N) and 10 h in the YK (Yakushima, 30.3-degrees-N) strains at 15-degrees-C. All the strains exhibited a weak ''circadian'' oscillation pattern in diapause incidence on Nanda-Hamner protocol. The dependence of photoperiodic time measurement on cycle lengths close to module tau was shown for the ON and OI strains by experiments using non-24 h light-dark cycles. Thus, no evidence was obtained for covariation between critical daylength and circadian oscillation pattern. The ON and OI strains showed similar patterns of response in the night-interruption experiment, despite the one-hour difference in critical photoperiod.																	0003-6862					NOV	1994	29	4					499	505		10.1303/aez.29.499								WOS:A1994PV05300004

FOODPLANT QUALITY AND POPULATION RANGE	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. The growth form and nutrient content of the foodplant of the butterfly C. palaemon, purple moor-grass Molinia caerulea, were compared in areas where larvae survived to hibernation and where they failed to develop, corresponding to the known distribution of microhabitats in which larvae were found and rarely occurred. Larvae tended to occur on foodplants of richer soils, such as flushes, in association with soil-enriching plants, and not in nutrient-poor conditions. 2. Larvae had a long development period from hatching in late June to hibernation in fate October or early November. Plants on which larvae survived had a larger growth form, fewer flowers, persisted longer and had higher nitrogen concentrations. 3. Larvae fed on only leaf blades with the highest nitrogen concentrations and, overall, plants in larval microhabitats were of higher nutrient status. 4. The differences in nitrogen concentrations were particularly pronounced towards the end of the larval season and plants in larval microhabitats remained green whilst plants in other areas were already senescent. 5. The longevity and enhanced condition of the foodplant in larval microhabitats are proposed as factors limiting the range of C. palaemon. The area the butterfly inhabits is shown to have a mild and wet climate with a long growing season. The species may be prevented from colonizing habitats to the south and west by a pronounced change in geology and topography, which may adversely affect the development and drainage of soils important in producing foodplants of enhanced nutrient status.																	0021-8901					NOV	1994	31	4					623	630		10.2307/2404153								WOS:A1994PT07000004

OBSERVATIONS ON A REARING POPULATION - RELATION WITH THE SEX DETERMINISM AND CONSANGUINITY	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY-ZEITSCHRIFT FUR ANGEWANDTE ENTOMOLOGIE												Observations made on a rearing population of Diprion pini L. bred since more than 30 generations in photoperiodic and thermic conditions favourable to without-diapause development, show that during the first reared generations sex-ratio evolued rapidly in favour of males while diapause rate highly increased, reaching more than 90% of individuals. Then diapause rates decreased gradually, after what, stay devinitively to a low level, while males remain much more numerous than females. These observations suggest a high consanguinity in rearing populations and that the increasing diapause rates, that are not without analogy with diapause variations during outbreaks of natural populations, may be linked with this consanguinity. Initial diapause rate recovery will result in the selection realised by the reproduction of the without diapause individuals only at every generation. The hypothesis is further advanced that the increase in males may result in a sex determinism well-known for some Hymenoptera and at least for a Diprionidae that involve the production of diploid males favoured by consanguinity. This phenomenon may be at the origin of observed diapause rate variations. Several factors such as insect weight, wing setae number and, in particular, the presence of heterozygote males in natural populations corroborate the existence of diploid males for D. pini. The existence of gynandromorphs in nature as in laboratory populations may also constitute an indicator of the consanguinity. Consanguine crossings realised between brother-sister insects through several generations reproduce the phenomena seen in rearing quite faithfully, as much for diapause as sex-ratio.																	0931-2048					OCT	1994	118	3					267	280		10.1111/j.1439-0418.1994.tb00802.x								WOS:A1994PW76600006

Changes in climatic conditions and food supply act as proximate triggers of migratory behaviour in partial migrants. Typical migrants like buntings use daylength as a cue but the exact mechanism of how photoperiodic information is translated in terms of migratory events is still not known. Almost entirely the photoperiodic effects have been explained on the basis of the involvement of hypothalamo/hypophyseal system. We feel mechanism(s) other than those acting through neuroendocrine system may be equally important. Furthermore the role of temperature has not been adequately explored so far. Our observations indicate the possibility that redheaded buntings might integrate the information received from photoperiod with environmental temperature (and other factors?) resulting in the development of migratory state. The physiological control of avian migration is much less understood. Majority of papers have centered around the 'gonadal hypothesis' of Rowan supporting or contradicting it without providing conclusive evidence. Pituitary prolactin has also been shown to be implicated although the mechanism of action is only speculative. Conclusive evidence for the involvement of thyroid hormones (thyroxine, T4; triiodothyronine, T3) in the physiological timing of migration has been produced attributing independent roles to T4 and T3. It is suggested that seasonal variation in peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 could serve as an effective strategy to render available the required thyroid hormones T4 and/or T3 during different phases of the year thus accounting for the metabolic switch over from T4-dependent moult to TS-dependent migratory fat deposition and zugunruhe and also ensuring preclusion of simultaneous occurrence of these mutually incompatible events. Considering that the number of environmental and physiological factors influence this mechanism and considering that thyroid hormone molecule has been put to a wide range of usage during the course of evolution the mechanism(s) of peripheral conversion of T4-T3 may assume great flexibility and have selective value-especially in migration which is known to have evolved several times in diverse avian families. The attractiveness of this hypothesis lies in the fact that it has potential to explain the both physiological development of the metabolic state of migration and at the same time the physiological timing of migration not only with respect to the cycle of environment but also with respect to other conflicting seasonal events (moult and reproduction).																	0250-5991	0973-7138				OCT	1994	19	4					453	466		10.1007/BF02703181								WOS:A1994PW58500010

The adequate response to photoperiod took place only at sufficiently high temperatures (27 to 30-degrees-C). The fraction of bugs entering diapause during the long-day period spontaneously increased up to 50-68% after decreasing the temperature to 24-25-degrees-C. The number of dispausing bugs at the day length of 16-18 h decreased considerably under the thermohythm 33-13,5-degrees-C as compared to response provoked by the constant temperature of 24-degrees-C which is approximately equal to average mean of the termorhythm. Nymphs could not complete the development at the constant temperature of 20-degrees-C, but they developed normally and about 50% of adults had no diapause at the day length of 17-18 h under the thermorhythm 27-13,5-degrees-C (average temperature 20-degrees-C). Under the natural thermorhythm 23-13-degrees-C all the bugs entered diapause at any day length. Probably, such response was caused by low average temperature. Thus, daily thermorhythms extended the temperaturee range of displaying of PhPR. The photo-thermal regulation of the colour in 5 nymphal stages of A. custos was revealed. The conclusion about its independence of PhPR controlling the diapause was drawn.																	0044-5134					OCT	1994	73	10					26	37										WOS:A1994PR64900003

House flies, Musca domestica L., have a cosmopolitan distribution and overwinter in northern latitudes in animal confinement quarters. We compared supercooling points with low temperature tolerances, as measured by bioassays, in all developmental stages of both species. There was no correlation between supercooling points and the ability to survive subzero temperatures. Rapid cold hardening was induced in adults of both species by a 2-h acclimation period at 0-degrees-C. Hemolymph melting points were measured osmometrically in diapausing and reproductive face flies. Freezing point depressions differed between diapausing and reproductive flies and between reproductive flies given a 2-h pre-exposure to 0-degrees-C and unexposed flies. Our data suggest that a -8 to 8-degrees-C range with a mean close to 0-degrees-C is necessary for successful face fly overwintering. House fly overwintering sites must offer microhabitats that remain above -5-degrees-C with sufficient time above 10-degrees-C to allow larval, pupal, and ovarian development.																	0022-2585					SEP	1994	31	5					671	680		10.1093/jmedent/31.5.671								WOS:A1994PF62500006	7966169

The linear correlation of the rate of development with the temperature is described. The developmental rate of eggs in the zone of constant temperatures between 13.5 and 33-degrees-C can be represented by equation Y = -16.13 + 1.19 T (Y - rate of development, T - temperature, degrees-C), for nymphs it has the form Y = -3.603 + 0.275 T. The theoretical thermal threshold of development of eggs was 13.5-degrees-C, and that of the nymphs was 13.1-degrees-C. The degree-day requirements of these stages were 65 and 250 respectively. The developmental thermal optimum of nymphs is shifted towards high temperatures, even at 20-degrees-C wings develop only in 16% of nymphs. The alternating temperatures influenced positively by increasing the survival of preimaginal stages. The native thermorhythms had the most stimulating effect by expanding the temperature range of development and increasing the growth rate. The deviation of real duration of nymphal stage from theoretical means increased with the decrease of temperature. The graph based on the sum of effective temperature indicates, that A. custos can produce two generations per year in 50-degrees-N. However, the phenological observations of several years indicated, that A. custos has only one generation at any weather. We assume, that monovoltinism of A. custos is controlled by a peculiar ecophysiological mechanism maintaining this type of seasonal cycle not only in forest - steppe, but in more southern zones as well.																	0044-5134					SEP	1994	73	9					43	53										WOS:A1994PM74500005

Incorporation rates of [H-3]leucine by lysates from 4-h anoxic embryos were 8% of those from aerobic (control) embryos, when assayed at the respective pH values measured for each treatment in vivo. Exposure of embryos to 4 h of aerobic acidosis (elevated CO2 in the presence of oxygen) suppressed protein synthesis to 3% of control values. These latter two experimental treatments promote developmental arrest of Artemia embryos and, concomitantly, cause acute declines in intracellular pH. When lysates from each treatment were assayed over a range of physiologically relevant pH values (pH 6.4-8.0), amino acid incorporation rates in lysates from quiescent embryos were consistently lower than values for the aerobic controls. Acute reversal of pH to alkaline values during the 6-min assays was not sufficient to return the incorporation rates of quiescent lysates to control values, Thus, a stable alteration in translational capacity of quiescent lysates is indicated. Addition of exogenous mRNA did hot rescue the suppressed protein synthesis in quiescent lysates, which suggests that the acute blockage of amino acid incorporation is apparently not due to limitation in message. Thus, the results support a role for intracellular pH as an initial signaling event in translational control during quiescence yet, at the same time, indicate that a direct proton effect on the translational machinery is not the sole proximal agent for biosynthetic arrest in this primitive crustacean.																	0027-8424					AUG 30	1994	91	18					8492	8496		10.1073/pnas.91.18.8492								WOS:A1994PE38800038	8078909

In the eastern Mojave Desert, male sidewinders traveled (xBAR +/- 1 SE = 185.4 + 17.1 m) significantly farther than nongravid females (xBAR = 122.9 +/- 10.1 m) within 24-h periods. This was chiefly a result of lengthy movements by adult males during the spring and fall mating seasons. Subadult sidewinders (2-3 yr old, xBAR = 223.1 +/- 25.3 m) moved significantly greater distances than neonates (1-3 months, xBAR = 125.5 +/- 22.0 m), juveniles (6 months-2 yr, xBAR = 148.3 +/- 14.3 m), and adults (>3 yr, xBAR = 123.8 +/- 12.1 m). Movements by all snakes were longest during the summer (xBAR = 191.2 +/- 17.7 m). Actual distances traveled averaged more than twice the straight-line distances between the beginning and end of movements, demonstrating the distinct tortuosity of C. cerastes movements. Sidewinders traveled on average 60% of the days monitored during their activity season (April-Oct.), with a resultant mean daily distance traveled of 117.8 +/-11.2 m/day. Although direction of travel was generally random, sidewinders exhibited significant directionality during the fall as they moved eastwardly to the sand-alluvial interface of the study site to overwinter. I speculate that overwintering in rodent burrows at the sand-alluvial interface increases overwintering survival because of decreased likelihood of exposure to freezing subsurface temperatures, greater structural stability of burrows, and lower risk of predation. Activity ranges of C. cerastes, calculated by minimum convex polygon (xBAR = 23.2 +/- 2.8 ha) and harmonic mean (xBAR = 20.9 +/- 2.6 ha) methods, are among the largest documented for snakes. For this population of sidewinders, there were no significant differences in activity range size between sexes or age classes (subadult vs adult). Core areas of activity (harmonic mean 50% isopleths) averaged 9.2 +/- 0.9% of total activity range size (harmonic mean 95% isopleths) and also did not differ in size between sexes and age classes. Activity range size did not correlate with body size (SVL and mass), although it did correlate with the number of locality coordinates used in its calculation. Activity ranges of individual sidewinders overlapped extensively on the study site, and snakes commonly shifted their centers of activity seasonally. Sidewinders moved their activity centers during the fall to the site's sand-alluvial edge and returned to the site's sandy region following emergence from hibernation.																	0045-8511	1938-5110				AUG 17	1994		3					631	645										WOS:A1994PD12700006

Within each population, absolute fecundity increased with total length. No evidence of atresia was found during the postlarval period. Significant differences in absolute fecundity, adjusted to a common size, were observed among populations. Absolute fecundity increased linearly with growth rate for a specific population sex ratio and ambient pH. At low pH, fecundity increased linearly with the proportion of males in a population. At approximately neutral pH, fecundity decreased linearly with the proportion of males. Maximum egg diameter, adjusted to correspond to that at maturity, varied among populations but was not consistently correlated with maternal size. Egg diameter varied for females from the various creeks but was not related to absolute fecundity, population sex ratio, or any of the abiotic characteristics measured.																	0045-8511					AUG 17	1994		3					718	725										WOS:A1994PD12700015

Larvae that did not pupate within 60 days were regarded as diapausing. Larval diapause did not occur in all populations at 16 h L : 8 h D. At 10 h L : 14 h D, four populations from tropical and subtropical zones included no diapausing larvae, whereas 60-99% of individuals from five northern populations of Japan and Canada were diapausing. Adult size increased with latitude of original locality. The proportion of autogenous females among those developed at 16 h L : 8 h D and 15 degrees C decreased with original latitude, whereas that among females from nondiapausing larvae reared at 10 h L : 14 h D and 15 degrees C was consistently high throughout the latitudes. At 10 h L : 14 h D and 15 degrees C, larval developmental characters of F-1 and F-2 hybrids between Malaysian (no diapause) and Japanese (diapausing) populations were intermediate between the parental populations. Expression of autogeny of the hybrids was similar to that of the Malaysian strain. A Canadian population, which might have been introduced from Japan, showed developmental traits similar to those of two populations																	0008-4301					AUG	1994	72	8					1462	1468		10.1139/z94-193								WOS:A1994PV94000014

Such feeding trade-offs could be manifested within insect populations as negative genetic correlations in fitness on different host species. We tested the hypothesis that feeding trade-offs were present within a population of the obliquebanded leafroller, Choristoneura rosaceana (Harris). Components of fitness were measured in families originating from an apple orchard that were fed on four host-plant species in the laboratory. Under the conditions of this experiment, all across-host genetic correlations were strongly positive, suggesting that this population comprised true generalists. With the exception of diapausing propensity, the heritability of the fitness components tended to be lower in caterpillars fed on apple leaves than in insects fed other hosts. This suggests a constraint on the selective response of the fitness components in the orchard environment.																	0013-8703					AUG	1994	72	2					173	180		10.1111/j.1570-7458.1994.tb01815.x								WOS:A1994PE95100009

The variability in the diapause length and the adaptability of the immature stages to a wide range of temperatures makes it difficult to predict the attacks and the phenology. In this paper, the effects of variable temperature regimes on both embryonic and larval development are studied in a natural environment. The experimental conditions covered the whole temperature range of the areas colonized by the pest. Several models were considered and their estimation were performed using the DEVAR software program applied to natural fluctuating temperatures. Before the application of DEVAR, its predictive power was tested using hypothetical data sets. The program was able to find parameter values leading to an excellent model fit. Four models were validated using data from three generations of natural populations of the pest. All models gave a good prediction for both embryos and larvae in all the years considered. The model can be usefully applied in population dynamics and in timing the application of both insecticides and entomopathogenic nematodes against the pest.

J	KOVEOS, DS; VEERMAN, A				KOVEOS, DS; VEERMAN, A			ACCUMULATION OF PHOTOPERIODIC INFORMATION DURING DIAPAUSE DEVELOPMENT IN THE SPIDER-MITE TETRANYCHUS-URTICAE	JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY												Photoperiodic control of diapause development was studied in three strains of the spider mite, Tetranychus urticae, originating from different latitudes in Europe. Diapause was almost fully maintained by a long-night regime during the first month of diapause, but was terminated rapidly and synchronously by a short-night regime. Diapause termination in continuous light was almost as rapid as in short nights; in continuous darkness diapause termination proceeded much slower, probably revealing the ''spontaneous'' rate of diapause development of these mites. The effect on diapause termination of successive short-night cycles appeared to be accumulated in a way comparable to cycle summation during diapause induction. The threshold for diapause termination by short nights, expressed as the number of cycles required for 50% diapause termination, was found to be lower the more southern the origin of the strain of mites. However, considerable differences in the number of cycles required for diapause termination were also present within strains: some mites needed only 3-4 short nights to terminate diapause, whereas others needed more than 10. In contrast with short-night cycles the effect of long-night cycles was not accumulative. Intensification of diapause under the influence of long-night cycles during its early stages appeared not to take place. Long nights were capable of maintaining the state of diapause if experienced before short-night cycles, but not afterwards. Short and long nights seem to act independently from each other, the former accelerating diapause development (''activation''), the latter slowing down diapause development (''diapause maintenance''). No antagonistic effect of long and short nights was found on the photoperiodic maintenance of diapause, in the sense that the effect of short nights might be diminished or even reversed by long nights, and vice versa, as found in photoperiodic induction of diapause in T. urticae. Therefore diapause maintenance does not seem to involve a photoperiodic counter mechanism comparable with the counter involved in the photoperiodic induction of diapause in these mites.																	0022-1910					AUG	1994	40	8					701	707		10.1016/0022-1910(94)90097-3								WOS:A1994PC51600007						
J	TEMTE, JL				TEMTE, JL			PHOTOPERIOD CONTROL OF BIRTH TIMING IN THE HARBOR SEAL (PHOCA-VITULINA)	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												The harbour seal (Phoca vitulina) has delayed implantation, precise annual birth timing, and significant latitudinal variation in birth timing. The birth timing patterns of four distinct groups of seals, including colonies of P. v. vitulina and colonies and captive individuals of P. v. richardsi, were examined using population-based photoperiod analysis to assess the role of photoperiod in setting annual birth timing. This analysis simultaneously determined the time, relative to birth, at which photoperiod response was likely to occur and the critical photoperiod. Despite marked differences in birth timing patterns, a high level of agreement was found among groups for the timing of photoperiod response. The two subspecies, however, demonstrated significantly divergent critical photoperiods. Eastern Atlantic harbour seals were exposed to a common critical photoperiod of 11.7 h/day on the 268th pre-partum day. Wild Pacific harbour seals were exposed to 14.3 h/day on the 283rd pre-partum day. These times corresponded to the estimated occurrence of blastocyst implantation. Using the above information, three small captive populations were subjected to artificially prolonged photoperiods during the period of embryonic diapause to test whether subsequent birth timing could be delayed. Technical difficulties invalidated results at two sites. At the third and largest colony, the mean pupping date of six individuals was significantly delayed by 10.7 days. The precision and latitudinal variation of annual birth timing in the harbour seal are due to a response to photoperiod which occurs immediately prior to blastocyst implantation. The critical photoperiod, however, is divergent among subspecies and, thus, has probably evolved allowing seasonal adaptation. Similar environmental signalling has been described for California sea lions and northern fur seals and represents the likely timing mechanism for most pinniped species.																	0952-8369					JUL	1994	233		3				369	384		10.1111/j.1469-7998.1994.tb05271.x								WOS:A1994PD26900003						
J	MILLER, DD; MARCUS, NH				MILLER, DD; MARCUS, NH			THE EFFECTS OF SALINITY AND TEMPERATURE ON THE DENSITY AND SINKING VELOCITY OF EGGS OF THE CALANOID COPEPOD ACARTIA-TONSA DANA	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												The potential effects of changes in seawater salinity and temperature on the density and sinking velocity of the eggs of the coastal/estuarine calanoid copepod Acartia tonsa Dana were evaluated in the laboratory using the Percoll density gradient centrifugation method. The developmental stage of the eggs also was investigated to determine if the density and sinking velocity of the eggs changed as the eggs developed. Results of developmental stage experiments for A. tonsa eggs spawned in seawater at a salinity of 15 parts per thousand and a temperature of 20-degrees-C indicated no statistically significant differences in measured mean egg densities or calculated sinking velocities between the different developmental stage groups (range of egg densities of 1.083 to 1.088 g/ml). Results of salinity experiments indicated that, for eggs spawned at a salinity of 15 parts per thousand and a temperature of 20-degrees-C, the measured mean egg density was 1.066 g/ml, while for eggs spawned at a salinity of 31 parts per thousand and 20-degrees-C, mean egg density was 1.086 g/ml. Measured mean egg densities and calculated sinking velocities were significantly different between the two experimental salinity conditions. Salinity crossover experiments, designed to investigate the effects of postspawning changes in seawater salinity on the density or sinking velocity of the eggs, demonstrated a statistically significant change in density and sinking velocity for eggs which were exposed to different experimental salinities post-spawning. These results indicate osmoregulation by the eggs. Results of the temperature experiments demonstrated that the mean densities and sinking velocities of eggs spawned at a temperature of 20 or 30-degrees-C (salinity of 31 parts per thousand) were significantly different. For these experiments, eggs spawned at a temperature of 20-degrees-C and 31 parts per thousand salinity exhibited a mean egg density of 1.087 g/ml. Eggs spawned at a temperature of 30-degrees-C and a salinity of 31 parts per thousand exhibited a mean egg density of 1.077 g/ml. The results of the salinity and temperature experiments demonstrated that both salinity and temperature significantly affected the density and sinking velocity of the eggs of A. tonsa. At temperatures greater-than-or-equal-to 20-degrees-C, typical sinking velocities for the eggs of A. tonsa in coastal/estuarine areas could be expected to range from 13 to 24 m/day, in the absence of turbulence. The gathering of information regarding the density and sinking velocity of copepod eggs is a crucial first step that may be used in conjunction with site-specific data (e.g. water depth, turbulence) to gain an understanding of depositional dynamics for cope-pod eggs in a given region.																	0022-0981					JUN 29	1994	179	2					235	252		10.1016/0022-0981(94)90117-1								WOS:A1994NY11100007

Concentrations of 0.05, 0.08, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 10, 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1,000 mug on Whatman no. 1 filter paper were tested. Male response increased with concentrations from 0.05 to 10 mug and decreased with those higher than 10 mug up to 1,000 mug. The log of concentrations and the corresponding insect responses had a positive linear relationship for the first range of concentrations and a negative linear relationship for the second range of concentrations. Response to the concentration with maximum male response (10 mug) appeared on the third day after adult emergence, increased gradually up to the sixth day, and dropped gradually thereafter. At the age of 35 d, a low response was still present in the flies. Males responded to pheromone during the last 4 h of the light period at a photoperiod of 14:10 (L:D) h. Response increased toward the end of this 4-h period. Response to the concentration of 10 mug decreased significantly after 1 min of continuous exposure to the pheromone, but increase of concentration did not increase the response of these insects.																	0046-225X					JUN	1994	23	3					726	731		10.1093/ee/23.3.726								WOS:A1994NT20200024

Dry matter accumulation and allocation were examined in populations of Plantago asiatica from contrasting climatic regions, grown from seeds for 16 months under identical experimental conditions. 2. The net production decreased with increasing length of growing season at the original habitat. 3. The higher latitude-altitude populations allocated a greater part of dry matter to storage (tap-root plus fine roots) and foliage and a smaller part to their reproductive system. 4. The higher latitude-altitude populations produced a smaller number of larger seeds during the experimental period, while those from the lower latitude produced a larger number of smaller seeds. 5. The higher latitude-altitude populations shed all their leaves at the end of autumn and overwintered in a completely dormant state, while the lower latitude ones held small overwintering leaves, having different structures and lower rates of net photosynthesis per plant compared to normal leaves developed during the main growing season. 6. Under the photoperiod regimes of 8, 16 or 24 h of light, the seeds produced by the higher latitude-altitude populations during the experimental period germinated in a higher and narrower temperature range than did the lower latitude populations.																	0269-8463					JUN	1994	8	3					400	409		10.2307/2389834								WOS:A1994NT77900015

The flowering response to photoperiodic variation and the genetic mechanisms controlling this response were studied. Day length variation was obtained by sowing the materials from September to December at Londrina, Parana (23-degrees-22'S latitude). The genetic models fitted to the means and variances of the generations indicated the predominance of additive effects controlling days to flowering. Significant dominance, epistasis and genotype x environmental effects were detected. No particular model was found to be associated with crosses where one of the parents was a carrier of the long juvenile trait. The predominant response of F7 lines to day length changes depended on the cross. Genes controlling classical and long juvenility combined freely; all crosses produced F7 individuals with classical or late flowering under short day conditions response to photoperiod. Intermediate responses between the typical classical and typical long juveniles were also observed in all cases. Such responses are only possible through the recombination of various genes of a single system.																	0100-8455					JUN	1994	17	2					187	195										WOS:A1994PA12300011

The present study evaluated that model with a world germ plasm collection of 369 accessions using two field environments in Syria and two in Pakistan. Photoperiod alone accounted for 69% of the variance in 1/f, the reciprocal of time (d) from sowing to flower. In contrast, temperature alone did not account for a significant proportion of variation in flowering time due to the exposure of plants to supra-optimal temperatures in the late-sown Syrian trial. With the model mean pre-flowering values of photoperiod and temperature combined additively to account for 90.3% of the variance of 1/f over accessions. The correlation of field-derived estimates of temperature sensitivity of accessions to glasshouse-derived estimates was significant at P = 0.05, but the equivalent correlation for estimates of photoperiodic sensitivity was higher at P < 0.01. Flowering in the field was better measured as time from sowing to 50% plants in flower rather than time to first bloom or its node number. Dissemination of the lentil crop following domestication in West Asia to the lower latitudes such as Ethiopia and India has depended on selection for intrinsic earliness and reduced sensitivity to photoperiod. Movement from West Asia to the higher latitudes accompanied by spring sowing has resulted in a modest reduction in photoperiod sensitivity and an increase in temperature sensitivity.																	0040-5752					JUN	1994	88	3-4					423	428										WOS:A1994NW97600025	24186029

These embryos and subsequent juveniles were reared at a development temperature and under a photoperiod regime that induced some fish from this second generation to mature in October 1992, the correct time of year for spawning of wild populations. Other captive groups of pink salmon also matured in April 1993, permitting a comparison of fecundity, egg fertility, and egg size among female spawners in different photoperiods. Although the wild population spawns only in odd years, the captive population, originally derived from odd-year spawners, has been manipulated to spawn in even years. This shifting of the spawning time of the captive population may permit a transplant of odd-year genes into an even-year line, perhaps allowing the development of a run of even-year pink salmon in the Fraser River, British Columbia.																	0008-4301	1480-3283				MAY	1994	72	5					826	833		10.1139/z94-112								WOS:A1994PG98700006

The animals, which included two long-term castrates, were exposed to natural light and temperature conditions at 69 degrees 46'N throughout the study. Melatonin levels were individually variable but did not differ systematically between the castrated and the intact animals. in months characterized by a marked diel light-dark cycle, the plasma concentration of melatonin varied throughout the day; levels were high during the dark phase and low during the light phase. In summer (May, June, and July), when daylight was continuous, and in December, when there was only a short period of twilight in the middle of the day, the pooled hourly mean levels of melatonin did not change significantly across 24 h. However, though the light was continuous, the intensity varied markedly between day and night in summer and all animals showed a slight increase in the plasma concentration of melatonin around midnight in July, In addition, daily secretion of melatonin increased from an annual minimum of 66-84 pg/24 h in June and July to an annual maximum of 525 pg/24 h in August when day length began to decrease from 24 h. We suggest that exposure to continuous light throughout the polar summer reduces the sensitivity of the reindeer pineal gland to light and that, consequently, the drop in light intensity around midnight stimulates secretion of melatonin, which in turn provides photoperiodic information even during periods of continuous daylight. It appears, likewise, that the melatonin profile is enhanced in August, signalling a longer night than that actually experienced. In these two ways, reindeer may receive sufficient photoperiodic information to trigger short-day responses, such as development of the gonads, while still exposed to long days and thus compensate for the late onset of short days in autumn, which is characteristic of high latitudes.																	0008-4301					MAY	1994	72	5					904	909		10.1139/z94-123								WOS:A1994PG98700017

For both traits, estimates of the narrow-sense heritability range from approximate to 0.05 to approximate to 0.15 (depending on how the data are analyzed). The study population was derived from isofemale strains created from wasps captured in a single bird nest. The same population exhibited no significant parent-offspring regression for the brood sizes associated with the first and second sex ratios. There may be a significant negative parent-offspring regression for diapause proportion in the first sex ratio broods. The estimates of the genetic correlations between first and second sex ratios are positive although almost all are not significantly different from 0.0. To our knowledge, this study is the first ''fine-scale'' analysis of genetic variation for sex ratio traits in any species of insect. Such studies are an essential part of the assessment of the validity of claims that sex ratio traits are locally optimal.																	0016-6731					MAY	1994	137	1					211	220										WOS:A1994NG99200019	8056312

All three studies had similar results. The temperatures 15 and 18-degrees-C appeared to enhance diapause development and subsequent diapause termination when compared with the lower temperatures (0-3-degrees-C). However, the temperature range 9-12-degrees-C was optimum for minimum mortality and maximum hatch at nearly all exposure times used. At this range and in particular 9-degrees-C, hatch was as high as 60% after 180 d exposure. Exposures of 15 and 30 d produced minimal hatch, <20%, at any temperature. Days to hatch tended to decrease as temperature increased but varied with experiment. Hatching time also decreased as exposure increased for all temperatures. Eggs exposed only to the developmental optima of 25-degrees-C had <20% hatch in all studies, and greater-than-or-equal-to 50% of the eggs were still in the diapause state at the conclusion of the studies. We concluded that most D. barberi embryos require low temperature to terminate diapause and complete embryogenesis. These studies support the hypothesis that D. barberi has a propensity to be continuously variable in diapause length. Also, variable diapause length has allowed this species to adapt to natural and artificial perturbations, in particular, crop rotation.																	0046-225X					APR	1994	23	2					464	471		10.1093/ee/23.2.464								WOS:A1994NM71200036

To examine the influence of parental effects on life-history traits in the obliquebanded leafroller, Choristoneura rosaceana (Harris), three successive generations were raised in a constant laboratory environment, the first and subsequent generations being produced by field-raised and laboratory-raised parents, respectively. Between-generation variation in phenotypic means, variances and among- and within-family variance components were used to assess the magnitude of the influence of parental effects on allelic expression. The differences between parent-offspring regressions derived using parents from the first and second generations were used to estimate the directionality of the influence of parental effects on the family means of the traits. It appears that parental effects influenced the mean and variance of life-history traits at population and family levels. For development time and within-family diapausing propensity, the families of parents developing in a specific environment (laboratory or field) were apparently affected by a similar parental effect. For larval growth rate and pupal weight, it appears that different parental effects transmitted by field parents influenced the family means. Consequently, parental effects transmitted by field parents did not change the correspondence between the offspring phenotypic and breeding values in the first two traits but modified this relationship in the later traits. Parental effects influenced simultaneously the range of phenotypes produced by a genotype and its mean phenotype. Therefore, they may represent a major developmental mechanism by which organisms adapt to unpredictable and predictable environments.																	0018-067X					APR	1994	72		4				420	430		10.1038/hdy.1994.58								WOS:A1994NF70800011

Six soil samples were collected from each of 34 sites broadly representative of the range of regional monsoon rain forest vegetation. Four floristic seed bank groups were derived through TWINSPAN classification. Mean group densities of germinants ranged from 25-144/M2. Dormant seed banks were least dense, and most sparsely distributed, in sandy soils. Seed bank samples were dominated by woody pioneer monsoon rain forest species, especially figs; exotic weeds and savanna taxa (e.g. Poaceae) were relatively more common at seasonally dry sites. Dormant seed banks comprised species mostly present in the standing vegetation, although a small number of germinants represented species not growing at half the sites. Regeneration of woody pioneers from dormant seed banks is least likely to be of importance on infertile, seasonally dry sites.																	1100-9233					APR	1994	5	2					161	168		10.2307/3236148								WOS:A1994NN71400003						
J	BLANCKENHORN, WU				BLANCKENHORN, WU			FITNESS CONSEQUENCES OF ALTERNATIVE LIFE-HISTORIES IN WATER-STRIDERS, AQUARIUS-REMIGIS (HETEROPTERA, GERRIDAE)	OECOLOGIA												Using field and laboratory observations and experiments over 3 years, I investigated whether reproductive trade-offs shape individual life histories in two natural populations of the water strider, Aquarius remigis, in which univoltine and bivoltine life cycles coexist. Both later eclosion dates and food shortages, even after adult eclosion, induced diapause in females, thus deferring reproduction to the following spring. Adult body size was positively affected by food availability during juvenile development. Higher food levels also increased the reproductive output of females, but not their longevity or oviposition period. When compared to spring breeders (univoltine life cycle), direct (summer) breeders (bivoltine life cycle) experienced reduced lifetime egg numbers and longevity, as well as reduced survivorship of their second-summer-generation offspring; these reproductive costs offset, at least in part, the advantage in non-decreasing populations of having two generations per year. Fecundity was correlated with body size, and among summer-generation females direct breeders were larger than non-breeders. The time remaining before the onset of winter and/or the time since adult eclosion augmented cumulative energy uptake, and consequently the lipid reserves and winter survival probability of non-breeding (diapausing) summer adults approaching hibernation. Overwintered spring reproductives died at faster rates than non-reproductive summer individuals despite greater food availability in spring, indicating a mortality cost of reproduction. Body length correlated with absolute and not with proportional lipid content but showed no consistent relationship with survivorship in the field. These results are in agreement with current theory on the evolution of insect voltinism patterns, and further indicate high degrees of life history flexibility (phenotypic plasticity) in the study populations in response to variable environmental factors (notably photoperiod and food availability). This may be related to their location in a geographic transition zone from uni- to bivoltine life cycles.																	0029-8549					APR	1994	97	3					354	365		10.1007/BF00317325								WOS:A1994NH87700009	28313630

Extremes in water level, ash content and organic components were typified by copepods and gelatinous forms. Ostracods and polychaetes were generally similar in composition to copepods, being only slightly higher in water level and ash content. Chaetognaths exhibited a composition intermediate in character with some components similar in value to that shown by crustaceans (i.e. protein) while other components were more in the range of values seen in gelatinous forms (i.e. water level and ash content). Protein was the major proximate component and measured values (as % AFDW) were fairly uniform among non-gelatinous species (x = 33.9 +/- 6.9). Lipid levels were variable, with high values (> 30% AFDW) only found for the copepods Calanoides acutus, Calanus propinquus and Euchaeta antarctica. Carbohydrate values were low in all species examined. Chitin was measured in crustacean species only. With the exception of C. acutus (x = 2.5% AFDW chitin), values were similar among species with mean values being slightly higher in fall (x = 11.8 +/- 2.5) than in winter (x = 6.7 +/- 1.8). Among non-gelatinous species, the ratio of carbon to nitrogen was positively correlated with the lipid to protein ratio, underscoring the compositional association between elemental and proximate components in these groups. In gelatinous species, the relationship between carbon:nitrogen and lipid:protein was inconsistent and less pronounced. Caloric content was estimated from recovered organic matter for nongelatinous species, As a function of wet weight and dry weight, values reflected differences in water level and ash content among individual species. As a function of ash-free dry weight, values were similar among all species (x = 3.6 +/- 0.9 kcal/g). Seasonal comparisons were possible for 12 of the 23 species. Among crustaceans, changes in water level and organic components were variable reflecting dissimilar trophic, reproductive or ecological habits among different species. Essentially no change in composition between fall and winter was observed for diapause species (e.g. Calanoides acutus and Rhincalanus gigas) as well as for omnivorous/carnivorous species (e.g. Gaetanus tenuispinus). Conversely, large compositional changes were evident for Calanus propinquus, a small-particle grazer that relies heavily on lipid reserves. Chaetognaths and some gelatinous species exhibited a considerable decrease in ash content from fall to winter which, for most cases, was mirrored by some degree of increase in lipid level. At present, however, scant data are available to help explain the observed patterns of compositional change within non-crustacean species.																	0722-4060					APR	1994	14	3					171	183										WOS:A1994NG67300004

Developmental and reproductive rates were relatively high and directly related to temperature between 15.6 and 26.7-degrees-C. Survival also was high throughout this temperature range. Lower thermal thresholds for development (t) of all immature stages fell between 11 and 12.5-degrees-C, and the K value for total development was 320 heat degree-days above 11.8-degrees-C. At 21.1-degrees-C, oviposition averaged 284 eggs during the first 30 days. Variability in diapause induction occurred within and among populations: a proportion of the Chilean and the Brazilian populations went into diapause under a short daylength, whereas no diapause occurred in the Honduran population. Chrysoperla externa appears well suited as a biological control agent for use in pest management programs in tropical and temperate regions of Central and South America.

Following exposure to a long-day priming photoperiod for 2 mo from the time of first feeding, progeny of stream-type chinook salmon undergo a reduction in growth during summer and remain as parr, whereas progeny of ocean-type chinook salmon and hybrids continue to grow during the summer and develop into underyearling smolts. Male purebred and hybrid F1 progeny of ocean-type and stream-type chinook salmon were backcrossed to females of both parental populations to examine the segregation of photoperiod-independent (smolt) and photoperiod-dependent (parr) phenotypes among progeny. Results of the backcrosses of the hybrid F1 males depended on female type. The backcross to ocean-type females produced progeny that were predominantly smolts, whereas progeny from the backcross to stream-type females segregated into approximately equal numbers of smolts and parr. These results are consistent with Mendelian inheritance of a single major gene with two alleles: a dominant allele for the photoperiod-independent phenotype of ocean-type chinook salmon and a recessive allele for the photoperiod-dependent phenotype of stream-type chinook salmon.																	0160-8347					MAR	1994	17	1A					13	25		10.2307/1352331								WOS:A1994NV72600003

Larvae that survived chilling as eggs survived to the pupal stage. Eggs of Aedes aegypti (L.) and Aedes triseriatus (Say) were included as control species. Eggs of temperate Ae. albopictus were more cold-hardy than eggs of Ae. aegypti but less cold-hardy than the eggs of Ae. triseriatus. Cold acclimation and diapause enhanced cold hardiness of only temperate Ae. albopictus. Cold acclimation had a greater influence on cold hardiness than did diapause. Both the temperature and the duration of cold acclimation modulated cold hardiness. Cold hardiness induced in the laboratory was similar to cold hardiness induced in the field in northern Indiana. The cold hardiness of Ae. albopictus from central Florida was intermediate in comparison with temperate and tropical strains. Tropical Brazilian Ae. albopictus and tropical Asian Ae. albopictus were similar in cold hardiness.																	0022-2585					MAR	1994	31	2					192	201		10.1093/jmedent/31.2.192								WOS:A1994MZ39400003	8189409

The goal of this statistical treatment was to quantify the role and interaction of latitude and country of origin (japan and the United States), photoperiod, rearing/holding temperature, and a newly identified element, elevation of the site of origin, with critical photoperiod (C(pp)). We also describe the development of an equation relating the incidence of diapause to daylength, rearing/holding temperature, and latitude and elevation of the site of origin, an equation useful in the development of a simulation model of the population dynamics and distribution of Ae. albopictus in North America. The analysis indicated that elevation from 0 to 300 m is significantly correlated with C(pp). The results also corroborate earlier conclusions that, on the basis of a shallower geographical cline in photoperiodic response in the United States, North American strains of Ae. albopictus have a temperate origin in Asia and indicate that the rapid spread of this mosquito within the United States via the distribution of used tires resulted in founder populations that were only partially adapted in diapause response to local conditions.																	0022-2585					MAR	1994	31	2					278	286		10.1093/jmedent/31.2.278								WOS:A1994MZ39400014	8189418

A temperate species, D. lutescens, was adapted to a wider range of temperature than the subtropical species: it was more cold-hardy than all three subtropical species and more heat-tolerant than D. prostipennis and D. trilutea. The temperature ranges encountered in the temperate region far exceed the range in subtropical areas, and this is likely to be reflected in the temperature adaptations of these temperate and subtropical species. D. lutescens has a photoperiodically controlled reproductive diapause. No latitudinal cline was observed on cold-hardiness of D. takahashii. By contrast, cold-hardiness and photoperiodic response differed between northern and southern populations of D. lutescens.																	0022-2933					MAR-APR	1994	28	2					401	409		10.1080/00222939400770181								WOS:A1994MY79900006

Grasshoppers were collected from a wide range of latitudes (32-degrees-57N to 41-degrees-20N) and altitudes (10 m to 3031 m), spanning much of the variation in climatic conditions experienced by these insects in California. When reared in a ''common garden'' in the laboratory, total embryonic development times were positively correlated to the mean annual temperature of the habitat from which the grasshoppers were collected (varying from about 19 days to 32 days when reared at 27-degrees-C). These grasshoppers overwinter as diapausing eggs and the proportion of embryonic development completed prior to diapause was significantly higher in populations collected from cool habitats (>70%) than in populations collected from warm environments (<26%). The length of pre-diapause development time is determined by the stage of embryonic development at which diapause occurs, and varies considerably among populations of these grasshoppers; grasshoppers from warmer environments tend to diapause at very early stages of embryogenesis, while grasshoppers from cooler environments diapause at very late stages. The combined effect of variation in embryonic development times and variation in the stage at which diapause occurs results in a dramatic reduction in the time needed to hatch in the spring; populations from warm environments required up to 20 days (at 27-degrees-C) to hatch while populations from cool environments required as few as 5 days to complete embryonic development prior to hatching. Egg size also varied significantly among populations, but tended to be larger in populations with shorter embryonic development times. Significant family effects were observed for development time and stage of diapause, suggesting significant heritabilities for these traits, although maternal effects may also contribute to family level variation. We interpret these findings to support the hypothesis that embryonic development time and the stage of embryonic diapause have evolved as adaptations to prevailing season lengths in the study populations.

J	CAREY, DB				CAREY, DB			DIAPAUSE AND THE HOST-PLANT AFFILIATIONS OF LYCAENID BUTTERFLIES	OIKOS												Results of three years of study on the host plant affiliations of two lycaenid butterfly species (Lycaenidae) suggest that differences between the two butterflies in host plant range, plant tissue oviposited on by adults and consumed by larvae, larval growth rates, and adult flight season may be consequences of a difference in diapause stage: one species diapauses as a pupa; the other as a larva. The experimental results and logic leading to this conclusion are summarized. The generality of the correlation between diapause stage and host plant relations are tested through a survey of North American and British lycaenids. Significant relationships are found. Egg-diapausing species tend to utilize woody hosts and be univoltine. Host range is intermediate. Larval-diapausing species utilize leaves of herbaceous plants and have narrow host ranges. Pupal-diapausing and nondiapausing species tend to utilize flowers of both woody and herbaceous plants and to have broad host ranges. These patterns are still significant when a taxonomy-based phylogeny of lycaenid butterflies is incorporated into the analysis - changes in diapause stage are concurrent with changes in host plant range and the part of the host plant used as an oviposition site. Diapause stage is taxonomically more consistent and behaviorally less flexible than either host plant range or oviposition site, however, and is thus likely to be a cause rather than a consequence of these host-plant affiliation patterns.																	0030-1299					MAR	1994	69	2					259	266		10.2307/3546146								WOS:A1994NA70300013

The extension of the development is caused by additional hibernation of larvae at the last stage and can be determined by microclimatic characteristics of biotopes. Adult beetles live no less than 2 years; most of them, probably, breed only after the second hibernation. Thus, the whole life cycle lasts 4 to 6 years. The strict seasonal determination of the development combined with the lability of reproductive period and the terms of pupation enables the species to occupy all the range of habitats despite general severity of the climate and the specific peculiarities of several biotopes.																	0044-5134					MAR	1994	73	3					29	38										WOS:A1994NG83500004

Short photoperiods induced prepupal diapause in the Kuroishi population but did not produce any developmental arrest in the Kobe population. The difference in the photoperiodic response in these populations reflects life-cycle adaptations to local environmental conditions. In the Kuroishi strain the critical daylength fell between 12.5 h and 13 h hours of light per day, Under 11L-13D conditions, high temperatures tended to decrease the occurrence of the diapause: as the temperature increased from 17-degrees-C to 20-degrees-C the diapause incidence diminished, ceasing altogether at 25-degrees-C. Parasite larvae of second and third instar stages were sensitive to diapause-inducing stimuli, whereas egg and first instar larval stages were not. The diapause termination depended not on the photoperiod but on the temperature: high temperature hastened termination of the diapause.																	0003-6862					FEB	1994	29	1					89	95		10.1303/aez.29.89								WOS:A1994MZ51800011

(Lepidoptera: Hesperiidae), laid 2-3 times fewer eggs than field collected females held under the same conditions. Adult-emergence and mating/oviposition cages may have to be placed in environmental chambers with controlled temperature and photoperiod to achieve normal mating and oviposition. Rearing required a mating/oviposition-cage at least 3 m3 in volume and honey as sustenance. Eggs and larvae were held in larval rearing cages and pupae were removed and held in adult emergence cages. Maximum oviposition occurred at dawn. The total developmental period from egg to adult was 34.7 days. P. mathias demonstrated a greater oviposition preference for rice and Paspalum conjugatum Berg. than for Dactyloctenium aegyptium (L.) Willd. P. mathias successfully developed to adulthood on all 24 species of Poaceae tested, exclusive of rice, but did not survive on the six species of Cyperaceae tested. Low populations of P. mathias in rice can be attributed to its low fecundity, wide host range, and equal adaptability to upland and lowland environments, thus diluting its number.																	0191-9040					FEB	1994	15	1					9	17		10.1017/S1742758400016702								WOS:A1994PX22800002

Both hypotheses were rejected. Serum-testosterone profiles differed between the two areas, with a sharper peak associated with the May-July breeding season among bears in Minnesota. Bears in Virginia and North Carolina had a longer period of elevated serum testosterone, in apparent accordance with more prolonged breeding periods reported for southerly populations of black bear. In both areas, serum-testosterone concentrations and size of testicles decreased from the breeding months to autumn. By December, when all bears in Minnesota were denned, testicles had ascended into the body cavity, and serum testosterone reached a nadir. Serum testosterone increased during late denning (February-March), and testicles of some bears became scrotal, supporting previous suggestions that the male reproductive cycle is triggered by photoperiod. However, we also observed age-specific differences in secretion of testosterone between study sites that appeared to be related to the effects of differing social structures.

These markers are distributed among 7 of the 12 chromosomes and therefore give a representative, though sparse, survey of the potato genome. Tuber specific gravity and tuder dormancy were studied. Two segregating diploid populations were constructed from heterozygous self-incompatible parents. These two populations, TRP132 (127 individuals) and TRP133 (110 individuals), have a common maternal parent and combine genomes of Solanum tuberosum (haploid), S. chacoense, and S. phureja. The populations were planted at two locations in Michigan in 1990 using a randomized complete block design with three replications per location. After harvest they were characterized with the isozymes and evaluated for specific gravity and tuber dormancy. To test for QTLs, one-way analyses of variance were conducted for each locus by trait combination. Significant associations between markers and quantitative trait variation were identified, which accounted for a range from 4% to 15% of the phenotypic variation for specific gravity, and from 4.5% to 20.4% for tuber dormancy. Two-way analyses of variance between significant markers were used to identify epistatic interactions between markers. Multiple regression analyses were used to estimate the overall effect of the significant markers on the phenotypic variation for these traits. These values ranged from 15.3% and 32.3% for specific gravity. For dormancy, the significant loci accounted for 8.5% and 36.9% of the total phenotypic variation for each of the populations. We find that isozyme analysis is a useful tool for preliminary QTL studies in potato.																	0040-5752					FEB	1994	87	7					764	772										WOS:A1994MY86300002	24190461

In all strains, seasonal reproduction is synchronized by photoperiodic variations: long days promote the onset of reproduction and prolong the breeding period. There is intraspecific variability in reproduction particularly in relation to latitude. Females originating from high latitudes breed later than those from low latitudes. Under photoperiod of Poitiers (46-degrees-40' N), the lag time is increased by two days per degree of latitude. The ability to remain in reproduction, after a first brood, is also related to the latitudinal origin of the strain: it is higher in the southern strains than in the northern ones. Modifications of temperature and photoperiodic regimes appear the most efficient method to evaluate the reproductive capacity of the females according to whether they stay in reproduction or not, when climatic conditions change. Moreover, in A. vulgare, the onset of reproduction is facilitated by the presence of males and there is also geographical variability of the male induced stimulation: the higher the latitude, the lower the male stimulating effect. Thus the selection has favoured, in the southern strains, both males and females with the highest capacity to reproduce early in the year and to maintain in reproduction for a long period. The role of thermoperiod is to strengthen the inhibiting effect of short days in the strains submitted to climates with a significant thermal day-night variation. Reproduction characteristics of each strain persist in females born and reared in the laboratory for several generations and therefore have a genetic basis: a genetic system involving maternal sex linked genes and autosomal genes with additive effects probably controls induction and maintenance of reproduction.

(Asteraceae). Seeds were collected from bagged flower heads, weighed and sorted into mass classes. Seed mass variation was 29-fold (range 0.111 to 3.210 mg), almost twice as high as in other species. For seeds buried in soil flats 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 cin, larger seeds had greater viability, emerged from lower depths, and had higher emergence rates. After 2-yr burial in nylon bags in the field, larger seeds had higher survivorship and viability rates but lower germination rates. The lower germination rates of large seeds after burial in the field may be due to dormancy. This study is the first to test seeds previously buried and recovered for survival, viability and germination. Seed-mass variation may be maintained by differential dormancy and germination which results in spreading the risk of recruitment.

The model is based on development/temperature relationships obtained from experiments on the parasitoid in quarantine prior to its release, allowing early predictions of its phenology in different parts of the target pest's New Zealand range. In particular the model was used to predict the number of parasitoid generations each year, the degree of temporal synchrony between parasitoid adults and the susceptible adult pest stage, the order of parasitism and reproduction in the pest's life cycle as a possible basis for a simplified, discrete host/parasitoid population model, and the likely significance of ecotypic differences in development and diapause characteristics of the parasitoid. These applications demonstrate the potential for simple models to help in climate matching of classical biological control agents and estimation of their interaction with pest dynamics, using data obtainable prior to their introduction and release. In addition the model proved useful as a decision aid during the release programme, by indicating the likely effects of unusual weather and the need or otherwise for further parasitoid releases.

Annual dormancy cycle and influence of flooding in buried seeds of mudflat populations of the summer annual Leucospora multifida	ECOSCIENCE												Dormant seeds of Leucospora multifida (Michx) Nutt. were used to determine: (1) temperature requirements for loss of dormancy; (2) if buried seeds undergo seasonal changes in their dormancy states; and (3) effects of flooding on dormancy loss and induction. Seeds came out of dormancy when buried at 5 degrees C and 15/6 degrees C for 12 weeks, but at 20/10 degrees C, 25/15 degrees C and 30/15 degrees C, they gained the ability to germinate only at 30/15 degrees C and 35/20 degrees C. Seeds buried in soil and exposed to natural seasonal temperature changes under non-flooded conditions exhibited an annual conditional dormancy/non-dormancy cycle, being non-dormant in spring and early summer, and conditionally dormant in late summer and autumn. Non-dormant seeds required light for germination at all thermoperiods, and they did not germinate in light or darkness at 15/6 degrees C. Flooding prevented non-dormant seeds from entering conditional dormancy in summer, and it prevented dormant seeds from coming out of dormancy in winter. However, if dormancy loss had started in late autumn prior to flooding, it continued during flooding in winter. Dormant seeds exposed to high temperatures become conditionally dormant, thus those that fail to come out of dormancy during flooding in winter could gain the ability to germinate at summer temperatures on exposed mudflats in summer. Responses of seeds to annual temperature and flooding cycles indicate that they could germinate from April to September or October, depending on when mudflats are dewatered.																	1195-6860						1994	1	1					47	53		10.1080/11956860.1994.11682227								WOS:000208104800006

Under a 16:8 (L:D) b photoperiod, all the strains showed peaks of activity at lights on and off, with additional activity during both light and dark periods; Egyptian females and both sexes of Cx. p. pallens were inactive during the photophase. Under 0:24 (L:D) h, the length of the free-running activity period was significantly shorter in the ''Iran'' (21 h) than in the other three Cx. p. molestus strains (range, 21-23 h) and Cx. p. pallens (almost-equal-to 24 h). Under 24:0 (L:D) h, the activity rhythm was obscured. The length of the period was shorter in 24:0 (L:D) h than in 0:24 (L:D) h, violating Aschoffs circadian rule. Furthermore, the circadian peak did not always occur every day under 24:0 (L:D) h but rather exhibited ''day-skipping.''

J	AMSTRUP, SC; GARDNER, C				AMSTRUP, SC; GARDNER, C			POLAR BEAR MATERNITY DENNING IN THE BEAUFORT SEA	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												The distribution of polar bears (Ursus maritimus) is circumpolar in the Northern Hemisphere, but known locations of maternal dens are concentrated in relatively few, widely scattered locations. Denning is either uncommon or unknown within gaps between known denning concentration areas. The Beaufort Sea region of Alaska and Canada lies in the largest of those gaps. To understand effects of industrial development and proposed increases in hunting, the temporal and spatial distribution of denning in the Beaufort Sea must be known. We captured and radiocollared polar bears between 1981 and 1991 and determined that denning in the Beaufort Sea region was sufficient to account for the estimated population there. Of 90 dens, 48 were on drifting pack ice, 38 on land, and 4 on land-fast ice. The proportion of dens on land was higher (P = 0.029) in later compared with earlier years of the study. Bears denning on pack ice drifted as far as 997 km (xBAR = 385 km) while in dens. There was no difference in cub production by bears denning on land and pack ice (P = 0.66). Mean entry and exit dates were 11 November and 5 April for land dens and 22 November and 26 March for pack-ice dens. Female polar bears captured in the Beaufort Sea appeared to be isolated from those caught east of Cape Bathurst in Canada. Of 35 polar bears that denned along the mainland coast of Alaska and Canada 80% denned between 137-degrees-00'W and 146-degrees-59'W. Bears followed to > 1 den did not reuse sites and consecutive dens were 20-1,304 km apart. However, radio-collared bears were largely faithful to substrate (pack-ice, land, and land-fast ice) and the general geographic area of previous dens. Bears denning on land may be vulnerable to human activities such as hunting and industrial development. However, predictable denning chronology and lack of site fidelity indicate that many potential impacts on denning polar bears could be mitigated.

J	WATT, PJ; ADAMS, J				WATT, PJ; ADAMS, J			ADAPTIVE VARIATION IN SEX DETERMINATION IN A CRUSTACEAN, GAMMARUS-DUEBENI	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												In some animals sex is determined after conception by environmental factors (environmental sex determination, ESD). In the amphipod Gammarus duebeni sex is reportedly determined by photoperiod: there is a higher proportion of males in broods reared under long-day than under short-day photoperiods. It has been proposed that this is an adaptive response to seasonal population dynamics. A test of the hypothesis would be to demonstrate changes in the degree to which sex is determined by the environment in populations from different latitudes with different dynamics. This study reports such a test. Environmental response is significantly less strong in a southern population with a Long breeding season than in a northern one in which breeding is seasonally restricted. Moreover, the threshold of the ESD cue for male or female determination is not defined when the breeding season is weakly seasonal. There is a broad correlation between latitude (and hence breeding seasonality) and the strength of ESD response across a series of population studies. Similarities between the Gammarus system of sex determination and that of the Atlantic silverside Menidia menidia, a fish with thermal ESD, are discussed.

The monkeys ate mainly winter dormancy buds when they visited the mulberry tree clumps for the first time within the winter, but they ate mainly bark when they visited for the second or third times. In the areas utilized by the monkeys over the recent three years, the mulberry trees compensated for the decrease in their number of shoots by producing longer shoots with more buds against the monkey foraging. In the areas used every year for more than four years, however, the mulberry trees were unable to compensate for the foraging pressure. Thus, although the monkeys had apparently operated prudent herbivory within three years, they did not do so on a longer time-scale. They shifted their utilization ranges after having over-exploited the mulberry trees.																	0032-8332					JAN	1994	35	1					15	24		10.1007/BF02381482								WOS:A1994MU06800002

Serotonin (5 mg) injected intracisternally produced significant decreases in cerebral blood flow and systemic pressure that lasted from 60 to 180 min after injection. Blood flow decreases, expressed as percentage change from baseline, seen during winter (n = 24) periods were significantly greater [analysis of variance (ANOVA), p < 0.02] from decreases seen during summer (n = 25) periods. Following serotonin injection, systemic pressure decreases between the winter and summer cats were not significantly different. Eleven summer cats were subjected to 3 days of continuous darkness before being injected with serotonin. Blood now decreases in the dark-exposed cats were significantly (p < 0.05) greater than those seen in normal light-exposed cats, whereas systemic pressure changes were not different. These studies suggest that the seasonal photoperiod may affect the sensitivity of cerebral vessels to intracisternally injected serotonin in cats.																	0742-0528					DEC	1993	10	6					442	448		10.3109/07420529309059720								WOS:A1993MM63600005	8111869

The question of whether or not the same photoperiodic clock is involved in both photoperiodic reactions was investigated in eight strains of the spider mite, originating from different localities in Europe. The methods employed consisted of (1) determination of the relative importance of the photophase and scotophase in the two photoperiodic reactions; (2) comparison of photoperiodic response curves for diapause induction and diapause maintenance; and (3) determination of the effect of light breaks on the capacity of long nights to maintain diapause, and comparison with the effect of light breaks in diapause induction experiments. The scotophase appeared to be much more important than the photophase for both diapause induction and diapause maintenance. In all strains the critical daylength for diapause maintenance, measured at the moment of saturation of the response to long daylengths, was identical to the critical daylength for diapause induction. However, the critical daylength for diapause maintenance appeared to be labile; it shifted gradually to shorter values as the mites were kept in the cold for a longer period of time, or were kept at a higher temperature for a progressively longer period of time after their stay in the cold room. This seems to reflect a gradual loss of photoperiodic control of diapause maintenance as diapause development proceeds. Photoperiods close to the critical daylength appeared to be less strong with regard to diapause maintenance than shorter daylengths. Quantitative differences in the ''strength'' of different daylengths were found in all strains investigated. Interruption of the night by short pulses of light revealed either one or two peaks of sensitivity in the night, or one broad ''trough'' where the two peaks had merged. However, in each case maximal sensitivity to the light breaks occurred at the same position in the night for diapause induction and diapause maintenance. The many similarities found lead to the conclusion that most probably the same photoperiodic clock mechanism is involved in both diapause induction and diapause maintenance in T. urticae.																	0748-7304					WIN	1993	8	4					265	282		10.1177/074873049300800401								WOS:A1993NF08200001	8032087

The animals were maintained at 12 degrees C and under 12L:12D photoperiod. Basal metabolic rate and thermogenic capacity of the wood lemming were studied. Basal metabolic rate was 3.54 ml O-2.g(-1).h(-1), which is 215-238% of the expected value. The high basal metabolic rate seems to be typical of rodents living in high latitudes. The body temperature of the wood lemming was high (38.0-38.8 degrees C), and did not fluctuate much during the 24-h recording. The high basal metabolic rate and the high body temperature are discussed with regard to behavioural adaptation to a low-quality winter diet. Thermogenic capacity, thermal insulation and non-shivering thermogenesis of the wood lemming displayed higher values than expected: 53.0 mW.g(-1), 0.53 mW. g(-1).degrees C-1 and 53.2 mW.g(-1), respectively. Brown adipose tissue showed typical thermogenic properties, although its respiratory property was fairly low, but mitochondrial protein content was high compared to other small mammals. The 24-h recording of body temperature and motor activity did not reveal whether the wood lemming is a nocturnal animal. Possibly, the expression of a circadian rhythm was masked by peculiar feeding behaviour. It is concluded that the wood lemming is well adapted to living in cold-temperature climates.																	0174-1578					DEC	1993	163	7					546	555		10.1007/BF00302113								WOS:A1993MU84500003	8151013					
J	REES, M				REES, M			TRADE-OFFS AMONG DISPERSAL STRATEGIES IN BRITISH PLANTS	NATURE												TRADE-OFFS are of fundamental importance in population biology. They prevent the evolution of a darwinian demon (a species that breeds fast, fives long and is both a good competitor and disperser) and result in the wide range of life histories we observe in nature1. Trade-offs are also thought to be important in ecology, driving successional change and maintaining species diversity2,3. But the demonstration of trade-offs is difficult4,5. Evolutionary theory predicts trade-offs between seed dormancy and (1) seed weight6 and (2) seed Spatial dispersal6,7. Here we present simulation results predicting a third trade-off between seed dormancy and adult longevity. The existence of these trade-offs is tested, to our knowledge for the first time, using modern comparative methods8,9 and data from long-term experiments10-12. The analyses are consistent with the existence of all three trade-offs in nature.																	0028-0836					NOV 11	1993	366	6451					150	152		10.1038/366150a0								WOS:A1993MG21600055

Larvae of A. rosae ruficornis showed the highest rate of development (K = 114.94-degrees at t0 = 10.55-degrees-C) and was the most heat resistant of the three species. Some pupae showed slight developmental retardation at intermediate photoperiods. A infumata was the most cold-hardy species and showed least tendency to diapause under the investigated conditions. It is estimated that A. infumata larval development required 136.9-degrees-d at t0 = 9.77-degrees-C. A. japonica entered diapause at the prepupal stage in response to photoperiod. Both long and short photoperiods induced diapause but continuous development occurred in a narrow range of photoperiods between 13L-11D and 14L-10D. A. japonica was the slowest developer of the three species. The supposed life cycles based on these data are consistent with the field observations of HIGASHIMOTO (1983) who observed six annual generations of both A. rosae ruficornis and A. infumata and two generations of A. japonica in the Kobe area.																	0003-6862					NOV	1993	28	4					407	415		10.1303/aez.28.407								WOS:A1993ML88900001

An insect's long-term fitness depends on its ability to exploit favorable conditions, to avoid unfavorable conditions, and to convert from one life style to the other. For the pitcher-plant mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii, we show that genetic variation exists in both development time (a demographic trait) and critical photoperiod (a phenological trait) in six populations spanning much of the species' geographical range. During the northward range expansion of W. smithii in North America, these traits have evolved independently under strong directional and stabilizing selection. The correlated response in critical photoperiod to divergent selection on development time reveals significantly positive genetic correlations in five populations and a negative correlation in one population. The positive correlations form a genetically coordinated phenotype: faster developing individuals use a shorter photoperiodic switch point and are able to exploit the late favorable season; slower developing individuals use a longer photoperiodic switch point and are able to avoid extending development into the unfavorable season. This genetic coordination of demography and phenology has not, however, prevented their independent evolution. We propose that evolutionary flexibility in W. smithii may arise in part from the reorganization of their genetic architecture following repeated founder events during their northward invasion of North America.

Relatively little is known about the response of tallgrass prairie vegetation to growing-season fires or follow-up management. We evaluated vegetation response of grazed, high-seral tallgrass prairies to herbicides after late-summer burning. Dry matter yields of little bluestem [Schizachyrium scoparium (Michx.) Nash], other perennial grasses, total perennial grasses, and total herbage were significantly reduced by late-summer burning. Tallgrass and annual grass standing crop did not differ between burn treatments. Forb standing crop on burned plots averaged about twice that of unburned plots. Follow-up treatment with 2,4-D[(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)acetic acid] significantly reduced forb standing crop compared to atrazine [6-chloro-N-ethyl-N'-(l-methylethyl)-l,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine]. Standing crop of tallgrasses and total perennial grasses was greater on plots treated with 2,4-D than on plots treated with no herbicide or with atrazine. Because late-summer burning did not severely reduce herbage production nor drastically alter community composition for more than 1 year, late-summer burning may be a viable alternative for brush control and for improving wildlife habitat in high-seral tallgrass prairie. If management objectives require reduced forb production and increased perennial grass production following late-summer burning, application of 2,4-D would be an appropriate management practice.																	0022-409X					NOV	1993	46	6					542	547		10.2307/4002869								WOS:A1993MG31300016

In the outlet stream of Lake Pitt in the Lower Laurentians Of Quebec, near the southern edge of its range, the species has a univoltine cycle. The adults emerged in late April and early May. The eggs, however, did not hatch till September and the first nymphs were collected in October. Growth continued throughout the winter and ended just before the emergence period. Though a wide range of sizes was present during the winter, there was a resynchronisation of the population before emergence and a short emergence period due to rapid growth of the smaller nymphs. Mature female nymphs were larger than males. The significance of the embryonic diapause in this northern species is discussed.																	0008-4301	1480-3283				OCT	1993	71	10					2136	2139		10.1139/z93-299								WOS:A1993MJ08000025						
J	TAYLOR, BE; GABRIEL, W				TAYLOR, BE; GABRIEL, W			OPTIMAL ADULT GROWTH OF DAPHNIA IN A SEASONAL ENVIRONMENT	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												1. The cladoceran Daphnia serves as an example of an iteroparous organism, with overlapping generations, that is capable of substantial adult growth. The life history of Daphnia was modelled as the consequence of a series of decisions about allocation of energetic resources to growth and reproduction. 2. We used numerical methods to find resource allocation patterns that maximized fitness of Daphnia in a temporally variable environment. Temporal variation was modelled as alternating active and dormant seasons; length of the active season was uniformly distributed. Fitness was measured by the geometric mean of resting eggs produced at the end of the active season. We examined effects of mean and range of the active season on the optimal life history; we also examined effects of increasing (invertebrate predation), constant (non-selective) and decreasing (fish) size-specific survival rates. For comparison, we found resource allocation patterns that maximized fitness in a constant environment, where fitness was measured by the intrinsic rate of increase r. 3. Life histories optimized for seasonal environments generally showed earlier maturity and greater adult growth than those optimized for constant environments. Adult growth occurred with non-selective predation, and even with fish predation, conditions under which it does not occur in the optimal life histories for constant environments. 4. Greatest size at maturity and adult growth occurred in life histories optimized to invertebrate predation in seasonal environments. Smallest size at maturity and least adult growth occurred in life histories optimized to fish predation. 5. In the optimal life histories, size at maturity generally increased with mean length of the active season. Adult growth reached a maximum for mean seasons of length equal to about one-half to one life span of Daphnia. 6. Increasing the variation in season length decreased adult growth in the optimal life history, but had little effect on size at maturity. 7.

Diapause occurred in all populations reared in short photoperiod situation (LD < 12:12). The percentage of pupae in diapause was variable. The effect of family and the dates of collecting samples from adjacent marroccan populations in diapause and its intensity was measured. Significant heterogeneity in diapause induction and development was found between and in populations and families. However, there is little evidence of any geographicA pattern to this variation.																	0931-2048					OCT	1993	116	3					273	283		10.1111/j.1439-0418.1993.tb01196.x								WOS:A1993MF81100005

Estimates of the optimal temperature range for development, threshold temperature, thermal constant, and degree day heat accumulations needed for development were obtained. The optimal temperature tested was 28-degrees-C based on the fastest development rate and lowest mortality. Temperatures in the 15-20-degrees-C range were considered suboptimal because mortality was high, the fifth instar diapaused, head capsule size was smaller, and the development rate was slower than at warmer temperatures up to 32-degrees-C. The latter temperature was near the upper end of the optimal developmental temperature range because development showed signs of a plateau and the humidity had to be raised from 45-50% to 80-90% to increase hatch and survival. Pre-diapause and post-diapause phases had different estimated threshold temperatures of 11.1 +/- 0.4-degrees-C and 15.0 +/- 1.0-degrees-C, respectively. Degree day (DD) accumulations or thermal constants for development of pre-diapause stages, post-diapausal development to the pupal stage and finally the pupal stage were 298.4 +/- 9.2, 403.3 +/- 14.0, and 128.7 +/- 1.3 DD, respectively. Overall, the DD requirement for development of diapause moths was 831.4 DD to develop from egg to adult. Non-diapause moths needed 546.2 +/- 21.4 DD for development from egg to adult. The data provides basic information on the biology of banded sunflower moths and have potential for the development of predictive models of the seasonal progress of this pest insect.																	0022-8567					OCT	1993	66	4					420	426										WOS:A1993NE35000008						
J	HARD, JJ; BRADSHAW, WE; HOLZAPFEL, CM				HARD, JJ; BRADSHAW, WE; HOLZAPFEL, CM			THE GENETIC-BASIS OF PHOTOPERIODISM AND ITS EVOLUTIONARY DIVERGENCE AMONG POPULATIONS OF THE PITCHER-PLANT MOSQUITO, WYEOMYIA-SMITHII	AMERICAN NATURALIST												We measured the additive genetic variance within populations and the composite additive, dominance, and epistatic effects contributing to differentiation of photoperiodic response between two southern (ancestral) and each of four progressively more northern (derived) populations of the pitcher-plant mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii. Critical photoperiod and its additive genetic variance but not its heritability increased with latitude. Directional selection on critical photoperiod during the northward divergence of W. smithii has therefore not eroded the additive genetic variance underlying this trait. Joint scaling tests of crosses between populations showed that epistatic effects, especially additive x additive and dominance x dominance interactions, overwhelm composite additive and dominance effects on critical photoperiod. The presence of substantial epistasis suggests that multiple founder events during the northward divergence of W. smithii may have been responsible for the release of progressively greater additive genetic variance in derived populations, despite directional and stabilizing selection to reduce it. If epistasis makes a similar contribution to the genetic differentiation of populations in other species, then current models of adaptive evolution that consider only additive genetic variation and covariation within populations may be of limited value in predicting how natural populations differentiate in life history.

Accessions showed cyclical behaviour in germinability, with peaks in autumn/early winter and troughs in spring/summer. There was considerable variation between accessions in dormancy/non-dormancy cycles, but when plants from accessions with contrasting cycles were grown in a common environment, the cycles shown by their seeds were virtually identical. Thus, the parameters of seed dormancy/non-dormancy cycles in E. australis appear to be under environmental control. Only part of an E. australis seed population demonstrated cyclical changes in dormancy status, in contrast to many other annual species whose entire seed populations undergo such changes. Populations also contained individuals which were either continuously dormant or continuously non-dormant following a period of after-ripening. The latter seeds give E. australis the flexibility to recruit opportunistically after summer rainfall events in mediterranean-climate environments.																	0307-692X					SEP	1993	18	3					275	280		10.1111/j.1442-9993.1993.tb00455.x								WOS:A1993LX65000003

Post-diapause beetles aggregated on one or a few of the plants in one of the plots for each release, but not on the same plants in different releases. Differences in plant attractiveness were therefore not likely responsible for the aggregatory behavior. Aggregations were probably a result of either coordinated movement from the release site to the plants or an aggregatory signal with a range of at least 15 m. Summer adults did not aggregate on plants. Correlations of summer beetle recapture distributions to wind direction showed that anemotactic behavior could not account for the major portion of variation in beetle orientation to the potato plots. Some positive attraction to the plots was indicated because more beetles were recaptured at the plots than would be expected from random motion. The number of beetles recaptured at plots covered by cheesecloth was not significantly different from recaptures on uncovered plots, indicating little reliance on visual cues specific to potatoes for location of the plants.																	0090-0222					FAL	1993	26	3					223	231										WOS:A1993MM68300004						
J	INNES, DJ; DUNBRACK, RL				INNES, DJ; DUNBRACK, RL			SEX ALLOCATION VARIATION IN DAPHNIA-PULEX	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY												Daphnia (Crustacea: Cladocera) reproduce by cyclical parthenogenesis in which the sex of offspring is environmentally determined. Although numerous studies have demonstrated that factors such as crowding and short-day photoperiod stimulate male production, there is limited information on variation in allocation to male and female offspring for any species of Daphnia. The present study assessed the presence or absence of male production in 96 isofemale lines (clones) from each of eight populations of Daphnia pulex. An average of 37% (range 18-51%) of clones failed to produce males under crowded conditions in the laboratory. A subset of 14 of these non-male-producing clones also failed to produce males under short-day photoperiod (8L:16D). Three male-producing clones were within-clone mated as well as crossed to three non-male-producing clones to study the inheritance of the failure to produce males. The average frequency of non-male-producing F1 progeny was significantly higher (58%, N = 486) among the outcrossed progeny than the inbred progeny (5%, N = 86). In addition, when sixteen of the male-producing outcrossed progeny were within-clone mated, only 7% (N = 106) of the resulting F2 progeny failed to produce males. These results are consistent with a genetic basis for the absence of male production. Average survival of the progeny from the nine outcrossed matings was more than twice (67%) that of the inbred progeny from the three within-clone matings (30%), suggesting that within-clone mating would result in significant inbreeding depression. We present a model that suggests that even low levels of inbreeding could allow non-male-producing females to be maintained in a population. The co-occurrence of non-male-producing females and females that produce both males and females in Daphnia pulex bears a similarity to the gynodioecious breeding system found in some plant species.

Experimental colonies were derived from clones that had been reproducing for at least 15 months under constant laboratory conditions. At constant 20-23-degrees-C, sexuparae were almost never produced regardless of the level of crowding or photoperiod. In contrast, every culture of several clones produced sexuparae when subjected to temperatures alternating between 20 and 15-degrees-C during the light and dark phases respectively. This fluctuating temperature regime resulted in sexupara production regardless of photoperiod. All cultures also produced some sexuparae when cultures were kept in constant darkness at temperatures that were either alternated between 20 and 15-degrees-C or kept constant at 15-degrees-C. Constant 17-degrees-C resulted in sexupara production in most cultures. At 17-degrees-C, experimental manipulation of densities within cultures showed that crowding promotes sexupara production. Thus, within the range of conditions occurring at the time of sexupara induction in the field, photoperiod has no effect on sexupara production, temperature below a threshold between 17 and 20-23-degrees-C triggers sexupara production, and crowding promotes sexupara production but only if temperature is low enough.

Response to day length is determined by the genotype, and the genetic control of flowering and growth is distinct and independent for long and short day conditions. In this work four parents, including three with a classical type of response to photoperiod (BR85-29009, FT-2 and BR-13) and one long juvenile trait carrier (OC-8), were crossed in all combinations to obtain six sets of F2 and F3 generations. The parental response to final plant height, days to flowering, trifoliolate leaf number and average length of the internode and the genetic mechanisms controlling photoperiodic response of these traits in the six crosses were studied. Variation in day length was obtained by sowing in September, October and November at Londrina (23-degrees and 22, of latitude). Results showed that additive genetic effects predominated in the control of all traits. For adequate progress, selection for plant adaptation must be done for days to flowering and/or final plant height at each sowing. There is probably a single genetic mechanism, involving several loci, controlling days to flowering in the three photoperiods in soybeans.																	0100-8455					SEP	1993	16	3					713	748										WOS:A1993MC77000018

Precipitation is concentrated in the winter, bur it varies in quantity and frequency among and within years. We discuss the importance of this variability in the structure of the plant communities along a latitudinal gradient encompassing tbe entire range of the coastal desert (27-30 degrees S). We present the results of three years of records of plant cover, species richness and phenology in permanent plots, and laboratory essays to determine the moisture thresholds for seedling emergence from soil samples. The communities comprise a high proportion (30-60%) of annuals. Northwards, shrubs increase in relative importance. Geophytes are mole abundant in the center of the gradient. In a wet year, absolute plant cover varied between 10 and 60% among sites, more than one half of which wag contributed by ephemeral plants. In a dry year (< 20 mm of rain) the ephemeral plant cover did not develop. This minimum amount of rai required for ephemeral plant growth coincides with the threshold for seedling emergence determined in laboratory experiments. Flowering showed a pronounced peak two months after the rain, and in some species it may continue during part of tho dry period. Maximum richness of native plant species and high endemism occur in the central part of the gradient studied, where areas protected from human activities are lacking.																	0716-078X					SEP	1993	66	3					271	282										WOS:A1993MF75000005

The two populations showed different life-cycle and diapause characteristics. The major differences were found in the number of generations per year (three versus two), the timing of induction and termination of diapause, temperature and oxygen conditions during diapause migration to the sediment, and habitat selection for wintering. Diapause initiation occurred at about 12 h light : 12 h dark in one population, but about 8 h L : 16 h D in the other. Higher habitat temperatures (approximately 5-degrees-C) seemed to allow completion of a further generation in the warmest lake. The population descending early into the hypolimnion utilized the deep profundal sediment as a diapausing habitat. These specimens were most likely physiologically prepared for diapause, including tolerance to low-oxygen or anoxic conditions. The population with an additional generation, probably not yet in the complete diapause phase, avoided low-oxygen conditions and utilized mainly the oxygenated part of the profundal sediment as a diapausing habitat. The major part of both populations diapaused in the sediment, but a small fraction was in ''active diapause'' in the plankton during winter. In these populations of T. oithonoides, day length, modified by habitat temperature, seemed to influence diapause initiation, whereas habitat distribution during winter seemed to be influenced by the combined effect of diapause ontology and oxygen conditions in the potential wintering habitat.																	0008-4301					AUG	1993	71	8					1663	1672		10.1139/z93-233								WOS:A1993LX16800025						
J	HOLBERTON, RL				HOLBERTON, RL			AN ENDOGENOUS BASIS FOR DIFFERENTIAL MIGRATION IN THE DARK-EYED JUNCO	CONDOR												Male and female Dark-eyed Juncos, Junco hyemalis hyemalis, partially segregate along a latitudinal gradient in North America during winter. The sex ratio favors males in the north and females in the south. The sexes differ, not only in their midwinter distribution, but also in the timing of fall migration, with females passing through stopover sites earlier than males. To investigate the basis for these differences in migration patterns, several measures of migratory behavior, including the date of onset and the duration of migratory activity (Zugunruhe), were compared in captive adult male and female juncos. When held under the same photoperiod and given free access to food, females initiated fall Zugunruhe twelve days earlier than males and continued to be active after the males stopped. This resulted in females showing, on average, 21 more days of migratory activity. There was no difference between the sexes in the proportion of nights during the migration period spent exhibiting migratory activity or in the average amount of activity per bird for the season. Females briefly showed higher migratory activity in early September. Both sexes exhibited a significant increase in body fat at the onset of migratory activity but there was no significant difference between the two groups at any time during the sampling period. Although differences in social status, physiological constraints, and/or importance of early arrival have been proposed as both past and current factors influencing differential migration in many species, these data illustrate sufficient endogenous sex-related differences that can result in differential migration in Dark-eyed Juncos.																	0010-5422					AUG	1993	95	3					580	587		10.2307/1369602								WOS:A1993LU78000010

Among the strains the phase of the eclosion median in an entraining diel light-dark cycle varied by 8.1 h, and the period of the free-running rhythm (tau) 2.2 h. In the comparison between the two regions, the Scandinavian entrained rhythm had on average a 2.8 h earlier phase, tau was 0.9 h shorter, and the amplitude of the rhythm was lower. Of the rhythm parameters, early phase was correlated with short tau (r = 0.76), and the amplitude of the entrained rhythm was correlated with the amplitude of the free-running rhythm (r = 0.98). In addition to the geographical variation, a putative arhythmic recessive autosomal mutant was found to segregate in one Scandinavian strain. The lack of photoperiodic adult diapause was confirmed in D. subobscura. The results show that the circadian eclosion rhythm in a non-photoperiodic species can vary latitudinally in a fashion similar to that of photoperiodic species.																	0018-067X					AUG	1993	71		2				210	218		10.1038/hdy.1993.126								WOS:A1993LR34300013

Fertilization occurs within the females and the internally brooded embryos develop into large benthic planulae that are released mainly in the late winter. Field-collected corals were held in the laboratory under contrasting photoperiod regimes (ambient or in-phase, and 6 months out-of-phase) for 6.5 years. After two years in the laboratory corals planulated at the same time, independent of photoperiod. Corals show a cyclic pattern of later winter and early spring planulation that coincides with declining sea temperatures in Monterey Bay. Gametes appeared in the first laboratory generation at 15 months and brooded embryos were found in females at 31 months under both light regimes. Planulae production by laboratory-reared corals peaked at the same time as that of the parents. These findings suggest that the temporal pattern of planulation is regulated by both endogenous and exogenous components that can be modified in some way by disturbance caused to the corals when collected or by the time of collection.																	0792-4259	2157-0272				AUG	1993	23	2-3					171	182		10.1080/07924259.1993.9672312								WOS:A1993MA13300015

During autumn migration, all tests took place under a sunny sky; birds were tested while living in the natural photoperiod (control) and with their internal clock shifted 4 h fast and 4 h slow. In spring, all birds were shifted 3 h fast; tests in overcast conditions, with the birds relying on their magnetic compass, served as controls. In control tests in both seasons, the birds preferred directions corresponding to those observed in the wild. When tested under sunny conditions with their internal clock shifted, the birds changed their directional tendencies. However, their preferred directions were different from those expected if a time-compensating sun compass was being used. After about 6 days, the shifted birds' directions were no longer different from the control direction. This behaviour argues against a major role of the sun compass in the orientation of day migrants. The dramatic changes of the sun's arc with geographic latitute might cause day-migrating birds to prefer a more constant orientation cue, such as the geomagnetic field. The initial response to the clock-shift might have occurred because the birds were confused by the conflicting information from solar and magnetic cues. This suggests that the sun is usually used as a secondary cue in combination with the magnetic field.																	0022-0949					AUG	1993	181						233	244										WOS:A1993LU60100014

The typically montane-adapted P. m. gracilis exhibited the most pronounced physiological and behavioral changes in response to winter, with P. l. noveboracensis and P. l. leucopus respectively exhibiting lesser degrees of these adjustments. In all mice, occurrence of torpor was confined to winter months. During mid-winter, nearly 40% of P. m. gracilis became torpid, contrasted with 15-20% and 10% of P. l. noveboracensis and P. l. leucopus, respectively. P. m. gracilis constructed larger nests and demonstrated a greater propensity to hoard food, and the percentages of mice that became reproductively regressed and that molted to winter pelage also were higher in P. m. gracilis than in the two subspecies of P. leucopus. Furthermore, P. m. gracilis consistently expressed these adaptations during a longer period of time than the other Peromyscus. While P. l. leucopus from North Carolina exhibited less pronounced seasonal adjustments than their more northern conspecifics, exposure to winter conditions in northern New York enhanced their adaptive response relative to mice at their native latitude. Of particular interest was our finding that the winter adaptive response in P. m. gracilis resulted in lower daily food consumption than observed in either of the subspecies of P. leucopus.																	0022-2372					AUG	1993	74	3					665	677		10.2307/1382288								WOS:A1993LU82400018

When the adults were deprived of food, they ceased oviposition, became tolerant to starvation, and their oxygen consumption rate decreased, but they did not accumulate lipid. Their oxygen consumption rate again increased when they were allowed to resume feeding. Therefore, food limitation induced quiescence in the adult. On the other hand, diapause was induced by short daylength (critical photoperiod was 12L:12D), leading to immature ovaries, hypertrophied fat bodies, lipid accumulation and low oxygen consumption rate even when food was available. However, in the study area most of the bugs probably did not enter diapause at any time of the year, because the shortest outdoor daylength including civil twilight was longer than the critical daylength for diapause induction.																	0013-8703					JUL	1993	68	1					71	77		10.1111/j.1570-7458.1993.tb01690.x								WOS:A1993LK07500009

Seeds of this valuable browse species are known to require moist prechilling before they will germinate. Our purpose was to investigate the nature of this dormancy breaking by placing packages (2 X 2-mm mesh screen) of seeds on the surface and buried in the seedbed at several locations in Idaho and Nevada and to recover the seeds monthly through the winter. The seeds were categorized based on their being: (a) capable of germinating; (b) dormant; or (c) dead at each recovery. The seedbeds of the 2 sites in Nevada, during 2 years of drought. were not sufficiently wet to bring large amounts of the antelope bitterbrush seeds out of dormancy. The seeds did not rot in the field. and being protected from predation, they remained dormant in the seedbed. The highest elevation site in Idaho had as high as 80% of the seeds lose dormancy. If seedbed microenvironmental conditions were satisfactory, the inherent seed dormancy was lost by midwinter. Snow cover, as it influences seedbed moisture and temperatures, apparently is an important factor in the prechilling of antelope bitterbrush seeds.																	0022-409X					JUL	1993	46	4					325	330		10.2307/4002467								WOS:A1993LN46700009

J	RANDOLPH, SE				RANDOLPH, SE			CLIMATE, SATELLITE IMAGERY AND THE SEASONAL ABUNDANCE OF THE TICK RHIPICEPHALUS-APPENDICULATUS IN SOUTHERN AFRICA - A NEW PERSPECTIVE	MEDICAL AND VETERINARY ENTOMOLOGY												Recent predictive models for the distribution of the African tick Rhipicephalus appendiculatus Neumann. based on the computer packages CLIMEX and BIOCLIM and data derived from meteorological satellites, and for the seasonal dynamics of the same tick using the computer simulation models ECFXPERT and T3HOST, all have their limitations. Statistical analysis of the relationships between the seasonal abundance of all three life stages of this tick and climatic and satellite-derived data from five sites in southern Africa, taken from the literature, supports a new perspective that it is the timing of the questing activity of the desiccation-vulnerable larvae that determines the pattern of the tick's seasonal dynamics. The timing of the activity of nymphs and adults is determined by temperature-dependent development rates plus the delaying phenomenon of photoperiod-sensitive diapause, the timing and duration of which have evolved to achieve maximum generation survival by ensuring the occurrence of eggs and larvae during periods of optimal climatic conditions. The most important environmental factor appears to be night-time minimum temperature, determining condensation and saturation deficit and thus the tick's ability to replenish moisture lost during the daytime and so to survive while questing for hosts. It is the larvae whose numbers are correlated most closely with these factors, consistent with earlier experimental results showing larvae to be most susceptible to desiccating conditions. There is a statistical linkage between larval tick numbers and satellite imagery, arising from the correlation between larval numbers and minimum temperature and saturation deficit conditions, and in turn the relationship between these climatic conditions and the subsequent vegetational changes monitored by the satellites. Moisture availability to larvae is likely to be the critical factor throughout the geographical range of R.appendiculatus, but the precise combination of climatic conditions that optimize moisture availability and questing tick survival can be expected to vary geographically. The relationships between ticks, temperatures and satellite data in parts of equatorial Africa have yet to be established. These correlative patterns highlight both the critical life stage and environmental factors when trying to understand temporal, and ultimately spatial, variations in tick abundance.																	0269-283X					JUL	1993	7	3					243	258		10.1111/j.1365-2915.1993.tb00684.x								WOS:A1993LM80400008	8369559					
J	ELSEY, KD				ELSEY, KD			COLD TOLERANCE OF THE SOUTHERN GREEN STINK BUG (HETEROPTERA, PENTATOMIDAE)	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												Diapausing and nondiapausing adults of the southern green stink bug, Nezara viridula (L.), had supercooling points in the range from - 10.4 to - 11.7-degrees-C. Lethal exposure times of adult stink bug are given for - 5.0, - 7.5, and - 10.0-degrees-C. No difference in cold tolerance was found between diapausing and nondiapausing stink bugs. Overwintering survival of confined adults at Charleston, SC, was high or 0 depending on severity of low temperatures.																	0046-225X					JUN	1993	22	3					567	570		10.1093/ee/22.3.567								WOS:A1993MC54300009						
J	GRANSTROM, A; SCHIMMEL, J				GRANSTROM, A; SCHIMMEL, J			HEAT-EFFECTS ON SEEDS AND RHIZOMES OF A SELECTION OF BOREAL FOREST PLANTS AND POTENTIAL REACTION TO FIRE	OECOLOGIA												To analyse the potential reaction to fire-generated heat pulses, seeds of 12 species of plants and rhizomes of three species were exposed to elevated temperatures for 10 min. The tested material split into three groups with respect to heat tolerance: (1) the rhizomes, for which the lethal temperatures were in the range 55-59-degrees-C; (2) the seeds of most of the species tested, for which the lethal temperatures were in the range 65-75-degrees-C; (3) The seeds of two species of Leguminosae and three species of Geranium for which the lethal temperatures were around 100-degrees-C. For all three Geranium species and for one of the legume species, Anthyllis vulneraria, exposure temperatures above ca. 45-degrees-C resulted in dormancy release, and maximum germination occurred above 60-65-degrees-C. Speed of germination was little affected for most species, except after exposure to near-lethal temperatures, where it slowed down dramatically, although the seedlings emerging were healthy. We conclude that due to sharp temperature gradients in the soil during fire, differences in heat tolerance between species in most cases are not large enough to be a decisive factor in their post-fire colonising success. There are exceptions: the seeds of certain taxa that arc impermeable to water in the dormant state, some of which have heat triggered germination.																	0029-8549					JUN	1993	94	3					307	313		10.1007/BF00317103								WOS:A1993LJ04100002	28313665

Pairs of egg sacs were removed from adult female copepods; one of each pair was exposed to a different photoperiod than the other, at the same temperature. Experiments were conducted at 8, 12, 16, and 20-degrees-C. Temperature had a significant effect on the duration of copepodid swimming activity and survival, and the onset of egg sac hatching was directly related to increasing water temperature. However, hatching duration and hatching success were not affected by temperature over the range tested. Photoperiod had no effect on hatching duration, hatching success, swimming activity, or copepodid survival. Our findings indicate that S. edwardsii copepodids can swim and survive for more than 2 weeks; much longer than the 2 days customarily reported in the literature. This must be accounted for in the development of strategies to control transmission.																	0008-4301					MAY	1993	71	5					972	976		10.1139/z93-128								WOS:A1993LU83400016

PHOTOPERIODIC INDUCTION OF LARVAL DIAPAUSE	JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY												The photoperiodic induction of larval diapause of the box-tree pyralid, Glyphodes perspectalis (WALKER) collected from four localities in Japan showed typical long-day response curves. The critical photoperiods were 14 h 20 min for the Miyagi and Fukuoka (Mt. Kosho; 862 m above sea level) populations, respectively, 13 h 50 min for the Tokyo-Chiba population and 13 h 40 min for the Kochi population at 20-degrees-C, showing a geographical cline. The critical photoperiods for the photoperiodic response in the offspring of overwintering generation of the Tokyo-Chiba population showed large individual variations. Moreover the critical photoperiod varied with temperature conditions, being higher at 15-degrees-C than at 25-degrees-C. When reared singly or in a crowded condition on three kinds of host plants, Buxus microphylla, B. sempervirens and B. microphylla var. insularis, their photoperiodic responses were typical long-day types except in the crowded condition on B. m. var. insularis where a high level of diapause was induced even under long-day conditions. This result suggested that dietary conditions were acting as regulating factors of diapause induction. The sensitive period for the photoperiodic induction of diapause lies between the first and third instar, especially the latter half. Photothermographs for four localities suggest the occurrence of two to four generations per year depending on the locality. For the Tokyo-Chiba population the predicted life cycle fitted well with the actual field observations.																	0021-4914					MAY	1993	37	2					45	51										WOS:A1993LE87900001						
J	KUMAR, V; FOLLETT, BK				KUMAR, V; FOLLETT, BK			THE CIRCADIAN NATURE OF MELATONIN SECRETION IN JAPANESE-QUAIL (COTURNIX-COTURNIX-JAPONICA)	JOURNAL OF PINEAL RESEARCH												Plasma melatonin concentrations were measured in Japanese quail held under different photoperiods and constant darkness (< 1 lux). When subjected to LD6:18 (6 hr light: 18 hr darkness), levels rose approximately 2 hr after lights-off, attained a peak level 8 hr after lights off, and subsequently declined to low daytime levels before the next lights-on signal. This generated a distinct daily rhythm in melatonin secretion with a duration of approximately 13 h. On exposing quail to a range of photoperiods, containing 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 18, or 20 hr of light per day, the onset of melatonin secretion remained essentially similar with the rise occurring soon after lights-off. However, the offset of melatonin secretion was suppressed by the light of the next day and thus a much truncated rhythm was produced under long (> 12 hr) photoperiods. Importantly, between night lengths of 4 to 18 hr (i.e., LD 20:4 to LD 6:18) a linear relationship existed between the duration of night-length and secretion of melatonin with the duration increasing by about 0.8 hr for each additional hour of darkness. If quail were released into darkness following a short (LD 6:18) or long (LD 26:4) day schedule, the rhythm persisted for at least two cycles with peaks occurring at about 24 hr intervals. In those quail coming into darkness from long days (LD 20:4), the rhythm of melatonin secretion decompressed rapidly on both sides of the peak, indicating that both the onset and offset of melatonin secretion were suppressed under long days. The endogenous nature of melatonin secretion was tested further by exposing birds to LD 6:30 for 4 cycles and then releasing into darkness. The rhythm in melatonin secretion persisted for at least three cycles before beginning to damp-out. The circadian nature of the rhythm in melatonin secretion was also examined by subjecting quail to T-cycles and then releasing into darkness. Both under the T-cycles and darkness following T-cycle treatments, the phase of the melatonin rhythm was advanced by > 3 hr under T = 27 hr cycles (LD 3:24) compared with T = 24 hr cycles (LD 3:21). This property is consistent with the melatonin oscillator being a circadian rhythm.																	0742-3098	1600-079X				MAY	1993	14	4					192	200		10.1111/j.1600-079X.1993.tb00502.x								WOS:A1993LJ30100005	8345447

Light-dark cycles of varying periods (T, 22-26 hr) with photophases of the same duration (12 hr) are used. The fattening response is shown to be a positive function of T in the interval 231/3 to 25 hr. These results indicate participation of the circadian rhythmics in photoperiodical induction of fat deposition in the chaffinch. They also demonstrate that variations in the phase of the rhythm within normal range can modify the timing of migratory fattening. A possibility for spontaneous changes in the phase of circadian rhythm to be involved in the circannual periodicity is discussed.																	0044-4596					MAY-JUN	1993	54	3					357	364										WOS:A1993LJ72100011

J	CLAY, K				CLAY, K			THE ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION OF ENDOPHYTES	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												The association between tall fescue and its endophyte is the best-known case of a symbiosis that is widespread in grasses, especially in cool-season, pooid grasses. Field and herbarium surveys have shown that many grasses are endophyte infected, often at 100% frequency. Ubiquitous endophyte infection with a host species is prima facie evidence that the association is mutualistic since ther are mechanisms by which individuals could lose the infection (e.g. extended seed dormancy). Studies have shown that the frequency of endophyte infection tends to increase over time, suggesting an ecological advantage for infected (E+) plants. A 3 year demographic experiment with tall fescue in a grassland community in Louisiana revealed that E+ plants had significantly higher survival, growth and flowering rates than E- plants. The mean fitness of E+ ball fescue was twice the mean fitness of E- plants. Greenhouse and common garden experiments have shown that E+ plants generally perform better than E- plants in mixtures. In order to separate the effects of endophyte-induced physiological changes in hosts versus protection against herbivory, a series of factorial competition experiments have been conducted where infection status, insect herbivory, density, and the identity of competing species were controlled. Preliminary results indicate that both infection and herbivory can affect competitive interactions among plants. The high frequency of seed-borne Acremonium endophytes within species of genera like Festuca, Lolium, Poa, and Stipa suggests that the association originated before speciation within these genera. The association of clavicipitaceous fungi with grasses spans a great range of interactions from localized ovarian parasites (e.g. Claviceps), systemic, choke-inducing fungi (e.g. Atkinsonella, Balansia, Epichloe), epiphytic fungi (Atkinsonella, some species of Balansia, Myriogenospora), and completely seed-borne, asymptomatic endophytes such as in Lolium. The question of what type of associations are ancestral and which are derived remains unanswered. The potential of these fungi for contagious spread and the presence or absence of a sexual reproductive system may influence genetic variation within taxa, and therefore their evolution and coevolution with grasses. Seed-borne Acremonium en-dophytes do not spread contagiously or reproduce sexually. They are reproductively isolated from other endophytes and can become genetically differentiated by the accumulation of random mutations. Isozyme electrophoresis has revealed abundant genetic variation in many Acremonium endophytes from wild grasses but, in contrast, artificial selection of cultivated grasses apparently has eliminated much genetic variation of endophytes. Future research on endophytes will focus on quantifying genetic variation for important traits such as alkaloid production, stroma formation, and host compatibility.

J	WASSMER, GT; PAGE, TL				WASSMER, GT; PAGE, TL			PHOTOPERIODIC TIME MEASUREMENT AND A GRADED RESPONSE IN A COCKROACH	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL RHYTHMS												Almost exclusively, photoperiodic insects respond to a given photoperiod in one of two ways: a ''long-day'' response or a ''short-day'' response. Intermediate responses occur only at a very restricted range of photoperiods (often less than 30 min) and are generally population phenomena rather than intermediate responses of individuals. In contrast, individuals of the wood roach, Parcoblatta pennsylvanica, show intermediate responses over a broad range of photoperiods. We examined the effect of constant light, constant darkness, and photoperiods ranging from 10 to 18 hr of light per 24 hr on growth rate as measured by weight gain, and found a robust photoperiodic response. Nymphs raised in photoperiods with light periods (photophases) from 0 to 12 hr gained little weight, whereas those in LD 18:6 were almost 15 times heavier. This is the first report of a photoperiodic response curve for a cockroach. Interestingly, there was a linear relationship between the duration of the photophase and weight gain over a broad range of photoperiods (LD 12:12 to LD 18:6; r2 = 0.99). Statistical analysis showed that the intermediate responses were attributable to individuals' growing at an intermediate rate. Another interesting observation was that all larval stages appeared to be capable of perceiving and responding to photoperiodic signals. The results of further experiments using non-24-hr photoperiods were consistent with the existence of a circadian component in the photoperiodic time measurement in this species.																	0748-7304					SPR	1993	8	1					47	56		10.1177/074873049300800104								WOS:A1993KW38600004	8490210					
J	YOUNG, BE				YOUNG, BE			EFFECTS OF THE PARASITIC BOTFLY PHILORNIS-CARINATUS ON NESTLING HOUSE WRENS, TROGLODYTES-AEDON, IN COSTA-RICA	OECOLOGIA												I studied the life cycle of a botfly (Diptera: Muscidae: Philornis carinatus) and examined the effects of botfly ectoparasitism on nestling house wrens (Passeriformes: Troglodytidae: Troglodytes aedon) during three years in Costa Rica. At three study sites, I found that nestlings were relatively unaffected by botflies, in contrast to all other studies of birds infected with philornid botflies. At Monteverde, the main study site, infected chicks grew slightly slower and had slightly shorter tarsi and wing chords than uninfected chicks, but both groups fledged at similar weights. Since weight at fledging is the only growth character associated with post-fledging survivorship, botfly infections likely cost wrens little in terms of fitness. At all sites, fledging success did not differ between infected and uninfected nests. Botfly infections were more prevalent at two lower elevation sites than at the high elevation Monteverde side. Infection prevalence increased during the nesting season at all study sites, which suggests a botfly life cycle in which adult population levels increase during the wren breeding season and then decline during a dormant period when wrens are not nesting. Finally, botflies may attack chicks throughout the period before fledging, but there is no indication they locate nests before hatching. In sum, botfly parasitism on wrens appears to be benign, perhaps because the study sites are at the edge of the botfly's range or because wrens are not a preferred host.																	0029-8549					MAR	1993	93	2					256	262		10.1007/BF00317679								WOS:A1993KR75300017	28313615

The higher the latitude from which the strains originated the longer was the period of chilling required for diapause termination, suggesting the presence of a gradient in diapause intensity, diapause being deeper the more northern the origin of the strains. Two strains originating from higher altitudes appeared to have a much deeper diapause than expected from their latitudinal origin. In addition, these two mountain strains showed mutual differences in diapause intensity, notwithstanding the fact that they originated from similar latitudes and altitudes; local climatic conditions probably act as strong selective forces with regard to diapause depth. All strains appeared to be sensitive to photoperiod during the period of diapause development. Diapause was quickly completed by a long-day photoperiod (LD 17:7 h), but was maintained by a short-day photoperiod (LD 10: 14 h). However, even under the latter regime sensitivity to photoperiod gradually diminished and eventually disappeared, thus leading to 'spontaneous' termination of diapause. The length of the period of diapause development, as measured by the sensitivity to photoperiod of diapausing mites, varied between strains; it was shorter in the southern strains and longer in the northern strains. The results indicate great variation in diapause intensity between strains, which is probably genetically determined and may have adaptive significance for this widespread species. When young females which had just entered diapause were kept for ever longer periods of time under the diapause inducing short-day regime at which they had been reared, before being transferred to the cold room, the duration of the period of chilling required for diapause termination was found to decrease proportionally in all three strains tested. These results suggest that intensification of diapause does not occur in T. urticae; diapause intensity seems to be highest at the beginning of diapause and to diminish gradually during diapause development.																	0307-6962					MAR	1993	18	1					50	56		10.1111/j.1365-3032.1993.tb00448.x								WOS:A1993KT35600007

Adults of the noctuid moth Autographa gamma undertake seasonal migrations into areas where they are unable to breed continuously. Individuals migrate into Britain each spring, and offspring of these migrants probably return in autumn to over-wintering areas in North Africa and the Middle East. However, the existence of these return migrations has been questioned. 2. Insects usually migrate during the adults' pre-reproductive period (PRP). The length of this period is therefore an index of migratory potential since individuals with longer PRPs have more time to express their potential for flight and to travel further before becoming sexually mature. 3. Offspring of insects from Morocco, Britain and Germany showed that, under both long and short photoperiods, PRP increased with latitude over the range 34-53-degrees-N. There were significant genotype-environment interactions in the effect of photoperiod on length of PRP. 4. However, PRPs of offspring from insects collected in Sweden were no different under a long photoperiod from those of offspring collected further south, and were significantly shorter under a short photoperiod than those of insects from Morocco. 5. With the exception of Swedish moths, offspring from insects collected at higher latitudes had longer PRPs and, therefore, the potential to travel further during migrations. The ability of some individuals to respond to environmental cues signalling habitat deterioration will further increase their potential to return to over-wintering areas further south.

The data were transformed to remove the influence of length of month and of linear trend, and the values were lagged 9 months to approximate the time of conception. Then, 11-year monthly averages were obtained and plotted as standard scores. Thus two 11-year sets of data were independently analyzed, providing the opportunity of replication. Four distinct temporal patterns were found, differing in month of occurrence of the initial trough and peak and the relative sizes of the two troughs; these characteristics of the temporal pattern change systematically with latitude in the eastern and midwestern states. Data from two other continents, the United Kingdom and Australia, also were analyzed using the same method and found to exhibit a temporal pattern during the year similar to the northern states of the USA. Two biologically relevant variables, temperature and photoperiod, were considered as possible controllers and regulators of the annual rhythmicity. Comparisons of the trends in conceptions with these environmental variables, and inspections of the temperatures and photoperiods at which peaks and troughs in conceptions were found, indicated that these environmental variables could not account for the annual rhythmicity in conceptions.																	0020-7128					FEB	1993	37	1					52	60		10.1007/BF01212768								WOS:A1993KP21500010	8468101

The majority of seeds are non-dormant when released The production of vegetative suckers is widespread in populations throughout the distribution of A. carnei. Caging experiments at Kinchega National Park indicated that rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus grazing was primarily responsible for the observed lack of recent regeneration.

Pairs included average-sized females and males encompassing the range of sizes observed in nature. Progenies were split and siblings were grown either individually or in groups, under otherwise identical conditions. The heritability, calculated from the regression of the mean length of male offspring against the length of their fathers, was very low in both conditions. Length at maturity was significantly greater for males raised in groups. Under this condition, some males delayed maturation and attained a larger size. We also tested the effect of different photoperiods (9 h of light and 15 h of dark, or viceversa) on size at maturity. Short photoperiods caused males to mature earlier, at a smaller size. As in other poeciliids, the trait size at maturity showed considerable phenotypic plasticity, possibly arising through social interactions. The possible adaptive significance of male size variations has been discussed.

The method consists of puncturing the elytra within the cream-colored longitudinal bands using a minuten nadeln; the wound response produces intense melanization at the point of puncture. Division of a band into three zones, each potentially receiving a dot, produces an octal digit. If all eight bands are employed, more than 16 million beetles can be uniquely marked. No significant survival effects of marking were seen in teneral, post-teneral, or post-diapause adult beetles. Propensity to fly in mid-summer beetles was generally unaffected by marking. Probabilities of mismarking and misreading are negligible if sufficient care is employed.																	0008-347X					JAN-FEB	1993	125	1					55	63		10.4039/Ent12555-1								WOS:A1993KP69300004

J	MOREWOOD, WD				MOREWOOD, WD			DIAPAUSE AND COLD HARDINESS OF PHYTOSEIID MITES (ACARINA, PHYTOSEIIDAE)	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY												Because of their economic importance as biological control agents, the basic biology of phytoseiid mites has been studied extensively. Diapause induction has been investigated in a number of species, with consistent results; however, very few studies have addressed cold hardiness of these mites. Recent studies of cold hardiness and cold storage of Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot and Amblyseius cucumeris (Oudemans) indicate that cold exposure had greater adverse effects on nondiapausing A. cucumeris, which normally overwinter in diapause, than on P. persimilis, which do not diapause. This might be explained in terms of adaptations for winter survival in their native environments. Phytoseiid mites are easily mass-reared and enter diapause in a facultative manner, and thus may be ideal subjects for investigation of the relationship between cold hardiness and diapause.																	1210-5759						1993	90	1					3	10										WOS:A1993LA59700001

The induction of diapause is governed by photoperiod, long day averting it. High temperature tends to prevent diapause even under a short-day photoperiod.																	1210-5759						1993	90	1					95	98										WOS:A1993LA59700012

LIFE-CYCLE, SEASONAL MORTALITY, PARASITES AND SEX-RATIO	JOURNAL OF APICULTURAL RESEARCH												Xylocopa fenestrata in a semi-arid subtropical climate at Hisar, India, exhibited a multivoltine life cycle, producing seven seasonal broods which could be characterized by the range of ambient temperatures experienced. Amounts of parasitization and mortality due to other causes varied with the seasons. Late summer was the most unfavourable season, with high parasitization and mortality, and minimal brood production. Early summer and early autumn were favourable periods for this bee, when large amounts of brood were produced. Adult emergence, parasitization and seasonal mortality in the various seasons were cyclic. The sex ratio in different seasonal broods was generally female-biased, especially during early summer and early autumn. There was no diapause during the developmental stages.

J	HODGSON, JG				HODGSON, JG			COMMONNESS AND RARITY IN BRITISH BUTTERFLIES	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Commonness and rarity among British butterflies have been examined by relating features of biology and ecology to geographical distribution. 2. No single attribute totally differentiates between common and rare species. However, several characteristics which are correlated with abundance appear likely to influence the capacity of species to exploit the artificial, disturbed and productive habitats which have been created by modern land-use and now occupy much of the landscape. Several features of geographical distribution, perhaps indicative of climatic tolerance are also correlated with abundance. 3. Species of butterfly which are recorded from the greatest number of 10-km squares in England, Scotland and Wales are relatively large, form 'open' or migratory populations, exploit larval food plants of productive habitats, have rapidly maturing larvae, hibernate as a pupa or an imago and extend into parts of NW Europe with relatively low summer temperatures. 4. Two groupings of common butterflies are distinguished: (a) those which produce several broods per year, are polyphagous, utilize larval food plants of disturbed habitats and have a short-lived imago (Pieridae subfamily Pierinae); (b) single-brooded, monophagous species in which the imago is long-lived and the larvae exploit species of food plants of undisturbed habitats (Nymphalidae subfamily Nymphalini). 5. By contrast, the rarest species of butterfly are variously large or small, tend to occur in 'closed' populations, produce a single brood per year, exploit larval food plants of unproductive habitats and produce long-lived larvae, with a life span exceeding that of the imago. Typically, these larvae feed on only one species or genus of food plant. 6. Butterflies and higher plants appear to have exhibited a similar range of reactions to modern land-use; changes in the length and quality of opportunities for food capture, development and reproduction provide a common explanation for these parallel responses. 7. It is argued that the classification of butterflies will be useful as a prediction of the ecology and changing abundance of individual species and will assist in recognizing conservation priorities. The criteria used for butterflies are applicable to other major animal taxa, and provide a conceptual link to theories already applied to vascular plants.																	0021-8901						1993	30	3					407	427		10.2307/2404182								WOS:A1993LT34600003						
J	MEYERPETERS, H				MEYERPETERS, H			SEASONALITY OF CIRCADIAN LOCOMOTOR-ACTIVITY IN AN INSECT	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY A-SENSORY NEURAL AND BEHAVIORAL PHYSIOLOGY												Daily periodic locomotor activity of Carabus auronitens was recorded in a climate-constant laboratory with the animals exposed to naturally changing photoperiods. Most actograms exhibit directed seasonal variations of duration and phase position of daily activity. Seasonal locomotor activity starts in early spring (following dormancy) on a low daily level, first being confined to a short time span around dusk (and even shorter around dawn). In the course of season, the daily onsets of activity become closely related with sunset and the duration of daily activity is steadily extended with both parts of the bimodal phase fusing to a common, unimodal activity band by late spring. Subsequently, it is further extended into forenoon, until in summer (shortly before aestivation), spontaneous phase inversion turns activity periodicity from nocturnality into diurnality within 1 day. Such seasonal variations are paralleled by changes in the precision of synchronization of the individuals' activity rhythms to the entraining light/dark cycle. No geographical differences were detected. The results support the idea of the circadian clock as a system of two dynamically coupled physiological oscillators that invert their phase relation as soon as the natural dark phase falls short of some minimum-tolerable night length.																	0340-7594					JAN	1993	171	6					713	724		10.1007/BF00213068								WOS:A1993KL49800003

Agardh) J. Agardh] from the west coast of Ireland has a heteromorphic life history in culture. Tetrasporangia are formed on uniseriate, filamentous tetrasporophytes, mainly under short-day conditions, at (7-)9-17-degrees-C. Although photoperiodic induction occurs, night-breaks of 1 h in the middle of a 16-h night are ineffective in suppressing this response. Tetraspores form further uniseriate filaments which produce multiaxial gametophytic thalli, mainly under long-day conditions at (7-)9-17-degrees-C. The critical daylength is not constant over this temperature range. Night-breaks promote the initiation of multiaxial thalli, and nine photoinductive long-day cycles induce a 50% response. At 16-degrees-C, equivalent photon exposures at two irradiance levels promote development of multiaxial thalli in long-day regimes but continue to inhibit induction in short days. Tetrasporophytes and uniseriate gametophytes reproduce asexually by fragmentation and monospores under all conditions. Multiaxial gametophytic thalli form monosporangia, gametangia, and develop carposporophytes regardless of photoperiod. Photoperiod and temperature as factors controlling the developmental life history sequence are used to formulate models to explain the phenology of H. stackhousei. These factors are also considered in relation to the biogeography of the species in the eastern North Atlantic and Mediterranean.																	0022-0981						1993	171	1					1	21		10.1016/0022-0981(93)90136-C								WOS:A1993LX81700002
