J	Postma, FM; Agren, J				Postma, Froukje M.; Agren, Jon			Among-year variation in selection during early life stages and the genetic basis of fitness in Arabidopsis thaliana	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Incomplete information regarding both selection regimes and the genetic basis of fitness limits our understanding of adaptive evolution. Among-year variation in the genetic basis of fitness is rarely quantified, and estimates of selection are typically based on single components of fitness, thus potentially missing conflicting selection acting during other life-history stages. Here, we examined among-year variation in selection on a key life-history trait and the genetic basis of fitness covering the whole life cycle in the annual plant Arabidopsis thaliana. We planted freshly matured seeds of >200 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between two locally adapted populations (Italy and Sweden), and both parental genotypes at the native site of the Swedish population in three consecutive years. We quantified selection against the nonlocal Italian genotype, mapped quantitative trait loci (QTL) for fitness and its components, and quantified selection on timing of germination during different life stages. In all 3years, the local Swedish genotype outperformed the nonlocal Italian genotype. However, both the contribution of early life stages to relative fitness, and the effects of fitness QTL varied among years. Timing of germination was under conflicting selection through seedling establishment vs. adult survival and fecundity, and both the direction and magnitude of net selection varied among years. Our results demonstrate that selection during early life stages and the genetic basis of fitness can vary markedly among years, emphasizing the need for multiyear studies considering the whole life cycle for a full understanding of natural selection and mechanisms maintaining local adaptation.																	0962-1083	1365-294X				JUN	2018	27	11					2498	2511		10.1111/mec.14697								WOS:000434152100002	29676059

Why do microbes exhibit weak biogeographic patterns?	ISME JOURNAL												Analysis of patterns in the distribution of taxa can provide important insights into ecological and evolutionary processes. Microbial biogeographic patterns almost always appear to be weaker than those reported for plant and animal taxa. It is as yet unclear why this is the case. Some argue that microbial diversity scales differently over space because microbial taxa are fundamentally different in their abundance, longevity and dispersal abilities. Others have argued that differences in scaling are an artifact of how we assess microbial biogeography, driven, for example, by differences in taxonomic resolution, spatial scale, sampling effort or community activity/dormancy. We tested these alternative explanations by comparing bacterial biogeographic patterns in soil to those of trees found in a forest in Gabon. Altering taxonomic resolution, excluding inactive individuals, or adjusting for differences in spatial scale were insufficient to change the rate of microbial taxonomic turnover. In contrast, we account for the differences in spatial turnover between these groups by equalizing sampling extent. Our results suggest that spatial scaling differences between microbial and plant diversity are likely not due to fundamental differences in biology, and that sampling extent should be taken into account when comparing the biogeographic patterns of microorganisms and larger organisms.																	1751-7362	1751-7370				JUN	2018	12	6					1404	1413		10.1038/s41396-018-0103-3								WOS:000432357500002	29662146

Assessing the current and future biological control potential of Trichogramma ostriniae on its hosts Ostrinia furnacalis and Ostrinia nubilalis	PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE												BACKGROUNDUnderstanding interactions between biocontrol agents and their pest hosts under climate change should assist implementation of biocontrol strategies, by identifying appropriate biocontrol agents for release or determining the optimal timing of releases. Species distribution models (SDMs) were applied to evaluate the distributions of Trichogramma ostriniae and its native host, Ostrinia furnacalis, in southeastern Asia, and a non-native host, Ostrinia nubilalis, in a novel range, North America, using MAXENT and CLIMEX modelling approaches. RESULTSThe models led to similar predictions about the expected distribution of the two species in Asia, and emphasized likely mismatches between host and natural enemy. Trichogramma ostriniae was predicted to occur in the summer corn region of China, with distribution limits linked to its sensitivity to cold, seasonality of radiation and precipitation. The modelled Ostrinia nubilalis distribution overlapped with the main corn production areas of the northeastern USA and Canada; temporary/seasonal suitable habitat was also predicted across the southeastern USA. Climate change scenarios are predicted to favour T. ostriniae over its hosts in northeastern China and North America. CONCLUSIONThe modelling approaches used here proved useful for assessing environmental factors linked to an egg parasitoid and its lepidopteran hosts and identifying areas potentially suitable for inundative releases.

Effect of temperature, host plant, and host instar on the development and survival of the parasitoid Semielacher petiolatus	BULLETIN OF INSECTOLOGY												Laboratory studies were conducted to assess the effect of temperature on the development and survival of the parasitoid Semielacher petiolatus (Girault) on its host, the citrus leaf miner Phyllocnistis citrella Stainton. Experiments were conducted at five constant temperatures (15, 20, 25, 30 and 32.5 degrees C), with RH 60 +/- 10% and a photoperiod of 14: 10 h (L:D). The relationship between the developmental rate and temperature was investigated using both linear and non-linear (Lactin's formula) models. The shortest developmental period was recorded at 30 degrees C and the longest at 15 degrees C. No adults emerged at 32.5 degrees C, as no pupa survived. Mortality (%) from egg to adult was lower at temperatures within the range 20-30 degrees C than at either 15 degrees C or 32.5 degrees C. The lower developmental thresholds estimated by the non-linear model for egg, larval and pupal development were higher than those estimated by the linear model. The estimated upper developmental thresholds for egg, larval and pupal development were 36.5, 32.9 and 30.9 degrees C, respectively. The optimum temperature for development ranged between 26.7-29.5 degrees C. Our results provide a broad insight into the biological characteristics and thermal requirements of S. petiolatus, factors important to further characterize its role as biological control agent under typical Mediterranean climatic conditions.																	1721-8861					JUN	2018	71	1					151	158										WOS:000430811100020

Immanuel			Assessment of SVM, empirical and ANN based solar radiation prediction models with most influencing input parameters	RENEWABLE ENERGY												This paper evaluates the accuracy of Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and empirical solar radiation models with different combination of input parameters. The parameters include month, latitude, longitude, bright sunshine hours, day length, relative humidity, maximum and minimum temperature. The models are evaluated based on statistical measures. Four new empirical models are introduced and validated with experimental data. This work is focused on the prediction of monthly mean daily global solar radiation (GSR) for different cities in India with most influencing input parameters identified using Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) software. WEKA identifies month, latitude, maximum temperature and bright sunshine hours as the most influencing and relative humidity as the least influencing input parameter. SVM model with most influencing input parameter performs better than ANN and Empirical models. Exclusion of relative humidity does not affect the prediction accuracy. Therefore this work reduces the dimensionality of the data and improves the prediction accuracy. This work also attempts in assessing the solar energy potential of smart cities of Tamil Nadu, India using the SVM model. The predicted annual GSR varies from 17 to 22 MJ/m(2)/day which is precise enough for a wide range of solar applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Rhipicephalus appendiculatus populations differ in their ecology, diapause behaviour and vector competence. Thus, their expansion in new areas may change the genetic structure and consequently affect the vector-pathogen system and disease outcomes. In this study we investigated the genetic distribution of R. appendiculatus across agro-ecological zones (AEZs) in the African Great Lakes region to better understand the epidemiology of ECF and elucidate R. appendiculatus evolutionary history and biogeographical colonization in Africa. Methods: Sequencing was performed on two mitochondrial genes (cox1 and 12S rRNA) of 218 ticks collected from cattle across six AEZs along an altitudinal gradient in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Burundi and Tanzania. Phylogenetic relationships between tick populations were determined and evolutionary population dynamics models were assessed by mismach distribution. Results: Population genetic analysis yielded 22 cox1 and 9 12S haplotypes in a total of 209 and 126 nucleotide sequences, respectively. Phylogenetic algorithms grouped these haplotypes for both genes into two major clades (lineages A and B). We observed significant genetic variation segregating the two lineages and low structure among populations with high degree of migration. The observed high gene flow indicates population admixture between AEZs. However, reduced number of migrants was observed between lowlands and highlands. Mismatch analysis detected a signature of rapid demographic and range expansion of lineage A. The star-like pattern of isolated and published haplotypes indicates that the two lineages evolve independently and have been subjected to expansion across Africa. Conclusions: Two sympatric R. appendiculatus lineages occur in the Great Lakes region. Lineage A, the most diverse and ubiquitous, has experienced rapid population growth and range expansion in all AEZs probably through cattle movement, whereas lineage B, the less abundant, has probably established a founder population from recent colonization events and its occurrence decreases with altitude. These two lineages are sympatric in central and eastern Africa and allopatric in southern Africa. The observed colonization pattern may strongly affect the transmission system and may explain ECF endemic instability in the tick distribution fringes.

J	Cunze, S; Kochmann, J; Koch, LK; Klimpel, S				Cunze, Sarah; Kochmann, Judith; Koch, Lisa K.; Klimpel, Sven			Niche conservatism of Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti - two mosquito species with different invasion histories	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Biological invasions have been associated with niche changes; however, their occurrence is still debated. We assess whether climatic niches between native and non-native ranges have changed during the invasion process using two globally spread mosquitoes as model species, Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti. Considering the different time spans since their invasions (>300 vs. 30-40 years), niche changes were expected to be more likely for Ae. aegypti than for Ae. albopictus. We used temperature and precipitation variables as descriptors for the realized climatic niches and different niche metrics to detect niche dynamics in the native and non-native ranges. High niche stability, therefore, no niche expansion but niche conservatism was revealed for both species. High niche unfilling for Ae. albopictus indicates a great potential for further expansion. Highest niche occupancies in non-native ranges occurred either under more temperate (North America, Europe) or tropical conditions (South America, Africa). Aedes aegypti has been able to fill its native climatic niche in the non-native ranges, with very low unfilling. Our results challenge the assumption of rapid evolutionary change of climatic niches as a requirement for global invasions but support the use of native range-based niche models to project future invasion risk on a large scale.																	2045-2322					MAY 16	2018	8								7733	10.1038/s41598-018-26092-2								WOS:000432275800032	29769652					
J	Labruna, MB				Labruna, Marcelo B.			Comparative survival of the engorged stages of Amblyomma cajennense sensu stricto and Amblyomma sculptum under different laboratory conditions	TICKS AND TICK-BORNE DISEASES												Recent studies indicated that the taxon Amblyomma cajennense (Fabricius, 1787) is a complex of 6 valid species, of which only two, Amblyomma cajennense sensu stricto (s.s.) and Amblyomma sculptum Berlese, 1888 are present in Brazil; the former species is found exclusively in areas of the Amazon biome, and A. sculptum mostly in the Cerrado biome. Populations of A. cajennense s.s. and A. sculptum are usually sustained by the same host species, and are found in many areas with similar temperature and photoperiod regimens. On the other hand, differences in the rainfall regimen and vegetation cover of the Amazon and Cerrado biomes, reflecting different vapor saturation deficit of atmosphere in the soil, could be primary factors driving the geographical distribution of the two species. In this study, all developmental stages in the life cycle of A. cajennense s.s. and A. sculptum were exposed to different temperature, photoperiod, and relative humidity (65, 78 or 100%) regimens that simulated mean conditions during summer or winter of one area of the Amazon and one area of the Cerrado in Brazil. Ticks were also exposed to water immersion during different periods of time (24, 48, or 72 h). Our experiments showed that A. sculptum showed significantly higher molting success for engorged larvae and oviposition success for engorged females than A. cajennense s.s. when these engorged ticks were incubated at higher saturation deficit conditions (65 and/or 78% RH with summer and winter mean temperatures). On the other hand, when ticks were immersed in water for 24, 48 or 72 h, there was a clear tendency for engorged stages (larvae, nymphs or females) of A. cajennense s.s. to have greater molting or oviposition success than A. sculptum. These results indicate that engorged stages of A. sculptum showed a greater capacity to survive under higher saturation deficit conditions (lower RH values associated with mean summer and winter temperatures), and engorged stages of A. cajennense s.s. had a greater capacity to survive under the highest moisture conditions, namely immersed in water for a relatively short period (24-72 h). When applied to the natural distributions of A. cajennense s.s. and A. sculptum in Brazil, we can infer that the former species is more adapted to the humid conditions of the Amazon biome, where the soil inside forests is quite moist throughout the year, and often swampy or flooded during the raining season. On the other hand, immature stages of A. sculptum are more adapted to the drought period of the Cerrado biome, when higher saturation deficit conditions prevail on the soil.																	1877-959X	1877-9603				MAY	2018	9	4					996	1001		10.1016/j.ttbdis.2018.03.019								WOS:000433129600034	29622517

Do Abrasion- or Temperature-Based Techniques More Effectively Relieve Physical Dormancy in Seeds of Cold Desert Perennials?	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT												Seed dormancy can present a significant barrier to restoration outcomes in dryland systems Physical and combinational (physical + physiological) dormancy are prevalent among seeds of many heibaceous perennials used in restoiation of drylands throughout the western United States Although many techniques designed to alleviate these dormancy traits exist, then efficacy is species specific, may result in embryo damage, and may have limited large-scale application To identify the most effective means of dormancy alleviation with the potential to be used on an opeiational scale, we examined the effects of 16 tempeiatuie-based techniques (altering temperature and duration of wet heat, freezing and wet heal, and freeze-thaw cycles) and 6 abrasion-based techniques (altering pneumatic scarification length or using a single duration of manual scarification) on the enhancement of seed permeability among two physically dormant (western prairie clover [Dalea ornata {Douglas} Eaton & Wright] and Munro's globemallow [Sphaeralcea mum munroana {Douglas} Spach]) and two combinationally dormant species (basalt milkvetch [Astragalus filipes Torr. ex A Gray] and longspur lupine [Lupinus at arbustus {Douglas} ex Lindl.]). We first assessed seed imbibition following exposure to all temperature- and abrasion-based techniques to identify those most successful at promoting seed permeability and then evaluated the effectiveness of those techniques through a series of germination experiments For combinationally dormant species, we also tested whether exposure to GA(3) enhanced germination Abrasionbased techniques were more effective than temperatur e-based techniques at improving water uptake across all species. Pneumatic scarification significantly improved germination, but optimal treatment durations were species specific GA(3) did not enhance germination under the tested conditions. We conclude that pneumatic scrification is a fast, safe, and effective method for alleviating physical seed dormancy with a potential to be scaled up for operational use in restoration.

Drivers of vegetative dormancy across herbaceous perennial plant species	ECOLOGY LETTERS												Vegetative dormancy, that is the temporary absence of aboveground growth for 1year, is paradoxical, because plants cannot photosynthesise or flower during dormant periods. We test ecological and evolutionary hypotheses for its widespread persistence. We show that dormancy has evolved numerous times. Most species displaying dormancy exhibit life-history costs of sprouting, and of dormancy. Short-lived and mycoheterotrophic species have higher proportions of dormant plants than long-lived species and species with other nutritional modes. Foliage loss is associated with higher future dormancy levels, suggesting that carbon limitation promotes dormancy. Maximum dormancy duration is shorter under higher precipitation and at higher latitudes, the latter suggesting an important role for competition or herbivory. Study length affects estimates of some demographic parameters. Our results identify life historical and environmental drivers of dormancy. We also highlight the evolutionary importance of the little understood costs of sprouting and growth, latitudinal stress gradients and mixed nutritional modes.

J	Zhang, HC; Liu, SG; Regnier, P; Yuan, WP				Zhang, Haicheng; Liu, Shuguang; Regnier, Pierre; Yuan, Wenping			New insights on plant phenological response to temperature revealed from long-term widespread observations in China	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Constraints of temperature on spring plant phenology are closely related to plant growth, vegetation dynamics, and ecosystem carbon cycle. However, the effects of temperature on leaf onset, especially for winter chilling, are still not well understood. Using long-term, widespread insitu phenology observations collected over China for multiple plant species, this study analyzes the quantitative response of leaf onset to temperature, and compares empirical findings with existing theories and modeling approaches, as implemented in 18 phenology algorithms. Results show that the growing degree days (GDD) required for leaf onset vary distinctly among plant species and geographical locations as well as at organizational levels (species and community), pointing to diverse adaptation strategies. Chilling durations (CHD) needed for releasing bud dormancy decline monotonously from cold to warm areas with very limited interspecies variations. Results also reveal that winter chilling is a crucial component of phenology models, and its effect is better captured with an index that accounts for the inhomogeneous effectiveness of low temperature to chilling rate than with the conventional CHD index. The impact of spring warming on leaf onset is nonlinear, better represented by a logistical function of temperature than by the linear function currently implemented in biosphere models. The optimized base temperatures for thermal accumulation and the optimal chilling temperatures are species-dependent and average at 6.9 and 0.2 degrees C, respectively. Overall, plants' chilling requirement is not a constant, and more chilling generally results in less requirement of thermal accumulation for leaf onset. Our results clearly demonstrate multiple deficiencies of the parameters (e.g., base temperature) and algorithms (e.g., method for calculating GDD) in conventional phenology models to represent leaf onset. Therefore, this study not only advances our mechanistic and quantitative understanding of temperature controls on leaf onset but also provides critical information for improving existing phenology models.																	1354-1013	1365-2486				MAY	2018	24	5					2066	2078		10.1111/gcb.14002								WOS:000428879800019	29197142

(Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) is the principal native pest of grape in the Palearctic region. In the present study, we assessed prospectively the relative abundance of the moth in Europe and the Mediterranean Basin using linked physiologically-based demographic models for grape and L. botrana. The model includes the effects of temperature, day-length and fruit stage on moth development rates, survival and fecundity. Daily weather data for 1980-2010 were used to simulate the dynamics of grapevine and L. botrana in 4506 lattice cells across the region. Average grape yield and pupae per vine were used as metrics of favourability. The results were mapped using the grass Geographic Information System (). The model predicts a wide distribution for L. botrana with highest populations in warmer regions in a wide band along latitude 40 degrees N. The effects of climate warming on grapevine and L. botrana were explored using regional climate model projections based on the A1B scenario of an average +1.8 degrees C warming during the period 2040-2050 compared with the base period (1960-1970). Under climate change, grape yields increase northwards and with a higher elevation but decrease in hotter areas. Similarly, L.botrana levels increase in northern areas but decrease in the hot areas where summer temperatures approach its upper thermal limit.																	1461-9555	1461-9563				MAY	2018	20	2					255	271		10.1111/afe.12256								WOS:000429089600014

Studies of physical activity, day length, and weather have primarily used self-reported activity, broad meteorological categorization, and limited geographic regions. We aim to examine the association of day length and physical activity in a large cohort of older women, covering a wide geographic range. Participants (N = 16,741; mean (SD) age = 72.0 (SD = 5.7) years) were drawn from the Women's Health Study and lived throughout the United States. Physical activity was assessed by accelerometer (ActiGraph GT3X+) between 2011 and 2015. Day length and weather information were obtained by matching weather stations to the participants' location using National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration databases. Women who experienced day lengths greater than 14 hours had 5.5% more steps, 9.4% more moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, and 1.6% less sedentary behavior, compared to women who experienced day lengths less than 10 hours, after adjusting for age, accelerometer wear, temperature, and precipitation. Day length is associated with physical activity and sedentary behavior in older women, and needs to be considered in programs promoting physical activity as well as in the analyses of accelerometer data covering wide geographic regions.																	2045-2322					APR 26	2018	8								6602	10.1038/s41598-018-25145-w								WOS:000430919900051	29700376

Elevated chaperone proteins are a feature of winter freeze avoidance by larvae of the goldenrod gall moth, Epiblema scudderiana	JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY					Symposium on Insect Molecular Physiology and Ecology - The Postgenomic Era at the 25th International Congress of Entomology (ICE)	SEP 25-30, 2016	Orlando, FL					Winter survival for many insect species includes a need to maintain metabolic homeostasis and structural/functional integrity of macromolecules not only over a wide range of cold temperatures but also in response to rapid temperature change. Chaperones are well-known to protect/stabilize protein structure with regard to heat stress but less is known about their potential involvement in long-term protection of the proteome at subzero temperatures. The present study assessed the participation of chaperone proteins in the cold hardiness of larvae of the goldenrod gall moth, Epiblema scudderiana (Clemens) (Lepidoptera, Olethreutidae), monitoring changes in nine proteins over the winter months as well as their responses to laboratory cold acclimation or anoxia exposure. Four heat shock proteins (HSPs: Hsp110, Hsp70, Hsp60, Hsp40), three glucose-regulated proteins (GRPs: Grp78, Grp 94, Grp170) and the tailless complex polypeptide 1 (TCP-1) as well as the heat shock transcription factor (HSF1) were investigated. In general, all were significantly elevated in larvae collected from an outdoor site between October and March, as compared with September values, and chaperone levels were reduced again in April. The October to March interval also includes the period of diapause followed by cold quiescence in the species. Relative expression of Hsp70, Hsp60 and Hsp40 rose by 2-3-fold, GRPs increased 1.5-3-fold, and levels of active (hyperphosphorylated) HSF1 increased by 4-4.8-fold over the midwinter months. Chilling from 15 degrees C to 4 degrees C in the laboratory upregulated Grp78 protein content that remained high as temperature was further reduced to -4 degrees C and then -20 degrees C whereas Hsp110, Hsp70 and HSF1 levels increased when larvae were exposed to -4 degrees C and -20 degrees C. Grp170 (also known as oxygen-regulated protein 150) was the only chaperone that increased significantly in the larvae in response to anoxia exposure at 4 degrees C. The data also indicated that multiple subcellular compartments received enhanced protection for their proteome since upregulation of chaperones included proteins known to occur in cytosolic (Hsp40, Hsp70), mitochondrial (Hsp60) and endoplasmic reticulum (Grp170) locations. Overall, the data indicate that chaperones have a significant role to play in the winter cold hardiness of E. scudderiana and identify declining temperatures (and perhaps also oxygen restriction) as potential modulators of chaperone production. The data add support to a relatively understudied area of insect cold hardiness the long-term protection and stabilization of the proteome over the winter months.																	0022-1910	1879-1611				APR	2018	106		2		SI		106	113		10.1016/j.jinsphys.2017.04.007								WOS:000432616900003	28433751

Although correlations of species ranges with climate are traditionally used to explore AM potential, successful AM strategies will have to consider many other variables. In this article, we review recent research that informs the complexity of AM decisions. Local microenvironment, herbivory, and intraspecific interactions frequently outweigh climate in determining species establishment and survival. Species adopt several strategies to cope with drought, heat, and cold, but translocated genetic material can display cryptic maladaptation when challenged by extreme, out-of-range weather events. Phenology, photoperiod, and climate are related in complex, often provenance-specific ways. We discuss the implications of our findings for forestry AM and make recommendations for incorporating these insights into future research and AM practice.																	0006-3568	1525-3244				APR	2018	68	4					251	263		10.1093/biosci/biy001								WOS:000430090000010

Mark			The role of latitudinal, genetic and temperature variation in the induction of diapause of Papilio glaucus (Lepidoptera: Papilionidae)	INSECT SCIENCE												A key adaptation in insects for dealing with variable environmental conditions is the ability to diapause. The tiger swallowtail butterflies, Papilio glaucus and P. canadensis are ideal species to explore the genetic causes and population genetic consequences of diapause because divergence in this trait is believed to be a salient factor in maintaining a hybrid zone between these species. Yet little is known about the factors that influence diapause induction in this system. Here we explored how spatial (latitudinal), environmental (temperature) and genetic (hybridization) factors affect diapause induction in this system. Specifically, a series of growth chamber experiments using wild caught individuals from across the eastern United States were performed to: (1) evaluate how critical photoperiod varies with latitude, (2) isolate the stage in which induction occurs, (3) test whether changes in temperature affected rates of diapause induction, and (4) explore how the incidence of diapause is affected in hybrid offspring. We find that induction occurs in the larval stage, is not sensitive to a relatively broad range of temperatures, appears to have a complex genetic basis (i.e., is not simply a dominant trait following a Mendelian inheritance pattern) and that the critical photoperiod increases by 0.4 h with each increasing degree in latitude. This work deepens our understanding of how spatial, environmental and genetic variation influences a key seasonal adaptation (diapause induction) in a well-developed ecological model system and will make possible future studies that explore how climatic variation affects the population dynamics and genetics of this system.																	1672-9609	1744-7917				APR	2018	25	2					328	336		10.1111/1744-7917.12423								WOS:000428328500014	27900827

Surfactant -Assisted BaTiO3:Eu3+@SiO2 Core-Shell Superstructures Obtained by Ultrasonication Method: Dormant Fingerprint Visualization and Red Component of White Light-Emitting Diode Applications	ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING												Nanoparticles (NPs) synthesized via a facile sonochemical route showed excellent assembly of BaTiO3:Eu3+@SiO2 superstructures (SS) using CTAB as a surfactant. Crystallite size, phase, surface science, and core-shell confirmation were determined through advanced characterization techniques. Experimental parameters like pH, temperature, and surfactant concentration were varied and resulted in SS with high surface modifications, and the possible mechanisms for the same are reported. Scanning electron microscopy images revealed broomlike structures, and various experimental parameters resulting in them dissolving into freestanding sticks are discussed. CIE chromaticity coordinates were in the range of the orange-red to pure red. Drawbacks associated with the commercial powder dusting method for visualizing dormant fingerprint (DFP), namely, high background scattering and high autofluorescence of the substrate material, were improved with the help of the prepared SS as a dusting powder. Visualization of DFPs and sweat pores on various kinds of surfaces was studied effectively and systematically and revealed the well-defined first-, second-, and third-level ridge particulars with high contrast, high selectivity, and low background interference. These results suggest different strategies to engineer SS and highlights a method to obtain high-resolution DFPs. The prepared compounds are also utilized in antiforging ink and optoelectronics applications.

Host Plant Selection by the Wheat Bug, Nysius huttoni (Hemiptera: Lygaeidae) on a Range of Potential Trap Plant Species	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY												The wheat bug, Nysius huttoni L. is an endemic New Zealand pest. The seedlings of forage brassicas are highly susceptible to direct feeding damage by this insect, and this can reduce plant establishment. Prophylactic use of pesticides is the usual practice for N. huttoni management. These practices have been linked to environmental pollution, biodiversity loss, and pollinator population declines in brassicas and other crops. Habitat management of the bug utilizing potential trap crops can be a better option for its management. A series of choice, no-choice, and paired-choice tests were conducted in a controlled-temperature room to evaluate the pest's preferences on seedlings of eight plant species. Kale plants (Brassica oleracea) were used as a potentially susceptible control, and seven non-kale plants were compared with kale as potential trap-plant species. These were: Lobularia maritima (L.) Desvaux (alyssum), Triticum aestivum L. (wheat), Phacelia tanacetifolia Bentham (phacelia), Fagopyrum esculentum Moench (buckwheat), Coriandrum sativum L. (coriander), Trifolium repens L. (white clover), and Medicago sativa L. (lucerne). In choice tests, wheat was the most suitable followed by alyssum, buckwheat, and phacelia, all significantly more favored than kale. In no-choice tests, alyssum was significantly more favored than kale and the other plant species except wheat and phacelia. First feeding damage was recorded on alyssum in both the above test conditions. For paired-choice tests including kale, wheat, and alyssum were significantly more suitable than brassica. These findings are important for developing agro-ecological management strategies. Alyssum followed by wheat were the most suitable trap plants for N. huttoni. These two plant species can be deployed in and around brassica fields either independently or as in a multiple trap-cropping system to reduce bug damage, minimizing or avoiding pesticides, and delivering a range of ecosystem services.

Evaluation of Pyrethroid Insecticides and Insect Growth Regulators Applied to Different Surfaces for Control of Trogoderma granarium (Coleoptera: Dermestidae) the Khapra Beetle	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY												The khapra beetle, Trogoderma granarium Everts (Coleoptera: Dermestidae), is a serious pest of stored products and is the only stored product insect pest that triggers a quarantine response when it is found in the United States. The larvae of T. granarium feed on a wide range of dry food products of plant and animal origin, including cereals, dried fish, and museum specimens. In this study, we evaluated the residual efficacy of two pyrethroid insecticides, deltamethrin and cyfluthrin, applied on concrete, wood, painted wood, vinyl flooring tile, and metal surfaces using small and large T. granarium larvae. Residual efficacy of two insect growth regulators (IGRs), methoprene and pyriproxyfen was also evaluated on concrete, metal, and wood surfaces. In both studies, larvae were exposed with provision of a food source on the treated surfaces and residual assays were conducted at 0 months (1 d), 1, 2, and 3 months post treatment. In general, both of the pyrethroids provided a high level of control of T. granarium larvae, though small larvae were much more susceptible than large larvae. The IGRs were comparatively less effective, with more larval survival and adult emergence of exposed larvae compared with the pyrethroids. Residues of the pyrethroids and IGRs were most persistent on the metal surface. Results can be used to help to control and eradicate infestations of T. granarium when they are detected in the United States.																	0022-0493	1938-291X				APR	2018	111	2					612	619		10.1093/jee/toy040								WOS:000429319200015	29514245

The present study aimed to determine the effects of temperature on the development, survival, and reproduction of Thrips hawaiiensis (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), an important flower-inhabiting thrips. These effects were evaluated at five constant temperatures (18, 21, 24, 27, and 30 degrees C) on thrips reared in the laboratory on excised Gardenia jasminoides flowers. The developmental durations of egg, first instar, second instar, prepupa, pupa, and the entire immature stages were shortened in response to a temperature increase from 18 to 30 degrees C. The highest generational survival rate was at 27 degrees C (75.00%), whereas the lowest was at 18 degrees C (46.00%). The minimum threshold and effective accumulated temperatures for completing a generation of T. hawaiiensis were 7.62 degrees C and 171.26 degree-days, respectively. The highest fecundity (95.80) was at 27 degrees C, but it was not significantly different than at 24 degrees C (84.72) or 30 degrees C (84.32). The highest oviposition rate of 5.57 eggs per female per day occurred at 27 degrees C, which was significantly higher than at any other temperature. Both the highest intrinsic rate of increase, at 0.200, and net reproduction rate, at 44.97, for T. hawaiiensis were observed at 27 degrees C, whereas the lowest values of 0.114 and 25.56, respectively, were observed at 18 degrees C. These results suggest that T. hawaiiensis is well adapted to temperate conditions, with an optimal temperature range for development of 24 to 30 degrees C, with the most suitable temperature for both development and reproduction being 27 degrees C.																	0022-0493	1938-291X				APR	2018	111	2					755	760		10.1093/jee/tox359								WOS:000429319200032	29408978

To gain insight into the genetic architecture of the hypothalamus and liver tissues of a long-distance migrant, we examined and compared the transcriptome profile of captive night-migratory black-headed buntings (Emberiza melanocephala) between photoperiod-induced winter non-migratory (WnM) and spring migratory (SM) life-history states under short and long days, respectively. High-throughput 454 pyrosequenced transcripts were mapped initially with reference to the genome of two phylogenetically close species, Taeniopygia guttata and Ficedula albicollis. The F. albicollis genome gave higher annotation results and was used for further analysis. A total of 216 (78 in hypothalamus; 138 in liver) genes were found to be expressed differentially between the WnM and SM life-history states. These genes were enriched for physiological pathways that might be involved in the regulation of seasonal migrations in birds. For example, genes for the ATP binding pathway in the hypothalamus were expressed at a significantly higher level in SM than in the WnM life-history state. Likewise, upregulated genes associated with the myelin sheath and focal adhesion were enriched in the hypothalamus, and those with cell-to-cell junction, intracellular protein transport, calcium ion transport and small GTPase-mediated signal transduction were enriched in the liver. Many of these genes are a part of physiological pathways potentially involved in the regulation of seasonal migration in birds. These results show molecular changes at the regulatory and metabolic levels associated with seasonal transitions in a long-distance migrant and provide the basis for future studies aimed at unravelling the genetic control of migration in birds.																	0958-0670	1469-445X				APR 1	2018	103	4					559	569		10.1113/EP086831								WOS:000428848500016	29380464

We investigated physiological plasticity in the spring body composition of adult female brown bears (Ursus arctos) across 4 diverse Alaskan ecosystems. Brown bears are a highly intelligent omnivore with a historic range spanning much of North America, Europe, and Asia. We hypothesized that body mass, fat mass, lean mass, and total caloric content would increase across populations with increasing food resource availability. Throughout their range, brown bears enter a period of torpor during winter months, decreasing their metabolic rate as an adaptation to this period of reduced food availability. They also give birth to and nourish offspring during this time. Due to this specific life history strategy, we further hypothesized that proportional body fat and the proportion of total calories derived from fat would be consistent across populations. Our results supported our first hypothesis: body, fat, and lean masses, and caloric content of bears across populations increased with the quality and abundance of available food. However, the proportional body fat content and proportion of calories from fat differed across populations indicating population-specific strategies to meet the demands of reduced seasonal food availability, offspring production and rearing, and climate as well as some plasticity to respond to environmental change or ecosystem perturbations. Investigations of body condition and energetics benefit from combined assessments of absolute, proportional, and caloric metrics to understand the nuances of brown bear physiological dynamics across and within populations.

The role of Rhytidoponera metallica (Hymenoptera, Formicidae) in facilitating post-fire seed germination of three ant-dispersed legume species	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												The fire avoidance hypothesis proposes that a benefit of seed dispersal by ants (myrmecochory) is to protect seeds from being killed during fire and to facilitate post-fire germination of seeds that require heat shock to break their physical dormancy. The aim of this study was to quantify the effect of fire and seed burial by a predominant seed-dispersing ant, Rhytidoponera metallica (subfamily: Ectatomminae) on germination levels of three ant-dispersed legume species (Pultenaea daphnoides, Acacia myrtifolia and Acacia pycnantha). Experimental burial of seeds within aluminium cans at a site prior to being burnt and at an adjacent unburnt site showed that fire increased germination levels, particularly for seeds buried at 1- and 2-cm deep and that overall, germination levels differed among the three plant species. To quantify seed burial depths and post-fire germination levels facilitated by R.metallica ants, seeds were fed to colonies prior to fire at the burnt and unburnt sites. Of the seeds buried within nests that were recovered, between 45% and 75% occurred within the upper 6cm of the soil profile, although unexpectedly, greater percentages of seeds were recovered from the upper 0-2cm of nests in the unburnt site compared with nests in the burnt site. Germination levels of buried seeds associated with R.metallica nests ranged from 21.2% to 29.5% in the burnt site compared with 3.1-14.8% in the unburnt site. While increased seed germination levels were associated with R.metallica nests following fire, most seeds were buried at depths below those where optimal temperatures for breaking seed dormancy occurred during the fire. We suggest that R.metallica ants may provide fire avoidance benefits to myrmecochorous seeds by burying them at a range of depths within a potential germination zone defined by intra- and inter-fire variation in levels of soil heating.																	1442-9985	1442-9993				APR	2018	43	2					128	138		10.1111/aec.12550								WOS:000428366200001

Home range utilization by chacma baboon (Papio ursinus) troops on Suikerbosrand Nature Reserve, South Africa	PLOS ONE												Rapid urbanization coupled with decreasing areas of natural habitat are causing baboon populations to become scattered and isolated, often resulting in increased levels of human-baboon conflict. To implement baboon-human conflict management strategies, it is essential to formulate realistic conservation policies that deal with all stakeholder concerns and ensure the conservation of viable baboon populations. A study was initiated in response to complaints of perceived excessive baboon numbers and associated lack of food resources on Suikerbosrand Nature Reserve in South Africa. Data obtained from GPS tracking collars fitted to one baboon from each of 10 identified troops were analyzed to determine home range size and utilization. The spatial representation of home ranges generated from this study will allow reserve management to identify areas of potential high and low human-baboon conflict and will contribute to the development of a formal baboon management plan to reduce human-baboon conflict on and around the reserve. Home ranges were unevenly distributed and had a mean size of 26.72 km(2) +/- 13.91 SD in the cold/dry season and 26.54 km(2) +/- 12.76 SD in the warm/wet season. Troop home ranges overlapped to some degree and five troops utilized areas outside the reserve. Although no significant relationship between troop size and home range was found, there was a positive relationship between troop size and daily distance travelled. All troops had significantly longer mean daily distances during the warm/wet season than during the cold/dry season (P <= 0.02).

J	Schowalter, TD				Schowalter, T. D.			Biology and Management of the Eastern Lubber Grasshopper (Orthoptera: Acrididae)	JOURNAL OF INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT												The eastern lubber grasshopper, Romalea microptera (Beauvois) (Orthoptera: Acrididae), is locally common in swamps, open woodlands, weedy fields, and ditches in the southeastern United States. This species displays bold color patterns that vary from primarily lighter yellows and oranges in eastern portions of its range (although the black form occurs throughout the range) to shiny black with red markings in western portions, exemplifying aposematic (warning) coloration. This grasshopper has a wide host range, with more than 100 known host plants, from which it can sequester or synthesize a variety of toxic chemicals. Lubber defenses are highly effective against vertebrate predators, but not against a variety of parasitoids and entomopathogens. Lubbers rarely cause serious damage, and their saliva is known to stimulate compensatory plant growth. Nevertheless, they can cause economic damage to citrus orchards, vegetable crops, and landscaping vegetation that border natural habitats. Damage typically is localized and can be managed effectively using an integrated pest management (IPM) approach. Insecticides are relatively ineffective and generally not recommended. Selecting less preferred host plants for landscaping where lubbers have been nuisances is a recommended strategy. When control is warranted, hand-picking and killing lubbers is effective at low densities. Several insecticides, including the microbial product, spinosad, are effective against nymphs. A granular bait containing 5% carbaryl is effective against lubbers of all stages, especially in areas dominated by less preferred hosts. Treatment can be focused in strips along the margins of orchards, crops, or landscaping to prevent lubbers from moving in. All insecticides should be used only according to label directions.																	2155-7470					MAR 16	2018	9	1							UNSP 10	10.1093/jipm/pmy004								WOS:000433588700001

Three laboratory colonies of H. armigera were established with insects from the states of Sao Paulo, Bahia, and Distrito Federal, that were collected from citrus, cotton, and corn, respectively. For each colony, microsatellites were used to assess genetic similarity among insects. The biology of the immature stages from each colony also was compared under laboratory conditions (25 +/- 1 degrees C, 70 +/- 10% RH, 14: 10 h [L: D] photoperiod). Microsatellite analysis revealed genetic variability in sampled specimens and that the grouping of individuals was independent of the geographic origin. The utility of an artificial diet was validated during the comparative biology experiment, and the ingredients of the artificial diet were analyzed for purity, particle size, and the presence and quantity of aggregates. The mean development times of the larvae and pre-pupae from the 3 locations were similar, and mean total development time (egg to adult) was not significantly different.																	0015-4040	1938-5102				MAR	2018	101	1					25	32										WOS:000429155000005						
J	Davison, PJ; Field, J				Davison, P. J.; Field, J.			Limited social plasticity in the socially polymorphic sweat bee Lasioglossum calceatum	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY												Eusociality is characterised by a reproductive division of labour, where some individuals forgo direct reproduction to instead help raise kin. Socially polymorphic sweat bees are ideal models for addressing the mechanisms underlying the transition from solitary living to eusociality, because different individuals in the same species can express either eusocial or solitary behaviour. A key question is whether alternative social phenotypes represent environmentally induced plasticity or predominantly genetic differentiation between populations. In this paper, we focus on the sweat bee Lasioglossum calceatum, in which northern or high-altitude populations are solitary, whereas more southern or low-altitude populations are typically eusocial. To test whether social phenotype responds to local environmental cues, we transplanted adult females from a solitary, northern population, to a southern site where native bees are typically eusocial. Nearly all native nests were eusocial, with foundresses producing small first brood (B1) females that became workers. In contrast, nine out of ten nests initiated by transplanted bees were solitary, producing female offspring that were the same size as the foundress and entered directly into hibernation. Only one of these ten nests became eusocial. Social phenotype was unlikely to be related to temperature experienced by nest foundresses when provisioning B1 offspring, or by B1 emergence time, both previously implicated in social plasticity seen in two other socially polymorphic sweat bees. Our results suggest that social polymorphism in L. calceatum predominantly reflects genetic differentiation between populations, and that plasticity is in the process of being lost by bees in northern populations. Significance statement Phenotypic plasticity is thought to play a key role in the early stages of the transition from solitary to eusocial behaviour, but may then be lost if environmental conditions become less variable. Socially polymorphic sweat bees exhibit either solitary or eusocial behaviour in different geographic populations, depending on the length of the nesting season. We tested for plasticity in the socially polymorphic sweat bee Lasioglossum calceatum by transplanting nest foundresses from a northern, non-eusocial population to a southern, eusocial population. Plasticity would be detected if transplanted bees exhibited eusocial behaviour. We found that while native bees were eusocial, 90% of transplanted bees and their offspring did not exhibit traits associated with eusociality. Environmental variables such as time of offspring emergence or temperatures experienced by foundresses during provisioning could not explain these differences. Our results suggest that the ability of transplanted bees to express eusociality is being lost, and that social polymorphism predominantly reflects genetic differences between populations.																	0340-5443	1432-0762				MAR	2018	72	3							UNSP 56	10.1007/s00265-018-2475-9								WOS:000428864200030	29568150

Winter swarming behavior by the exotic cladoceran Daphnia lumholtzi Sars, 1885 in a Kentucky (USA) reservoir	BIOINVASIONS RECORDS												We describe swarming behavior in the invasive cladoceran Daphnia lumholtzi Sars, 1885 in a Kentucky, USA, reservoir during winter 2017. The taxon is a highly successful tropical invader and has spread throughout the lower latitude systems in the USA since its discovery in 1991. Other than a few isolated reports, the abundance of D. lumholtzi is often <1 organism L-1. Previous studies indicate that D. lumholtzi is a largely thermophilic species often peaking in abundance in late summer after native daphnids are gone from the water column of lakes and reservoirs. Prior to our study, there have been no published reports of swarming behavior by this species. We document the occurrence of massive swarms (>10,000 organisms L-1) of sexually reproducing females of this exotic cladoceran at water column temperatures <10 degrees C.																	2242-1300					MAR	2018	7	1					43	50		10.3391/bir.2018.7.1.06								WOS:000428171100006

Cold temperature represses daily rhythms in the liver transcriptome of a stenothermal teleost under decreasing day length	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY												The climate-change-driven increase in temperature is occurring rapidly and decreasing the predictability of seasonal rhythms at high latitudes. It is therefore urgent to understand how a change in the relationship between photoperiod and temperature can affect ectotherms in these environments. We tested whether temperature affects daily rhythms of transcription in a cold-adapted salmonid using high-throughput RNA sequencing. Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) from a subarctic population were reared at a high and a low temperature (15 and 8 degrees C) for 1 month under natural, decreasing day length during late summer. Liver transcriptomes were compared between samples collected in the middle and towards the end of the light period and in the middle of the dark period. Daily variation in transcription was lower in fish from the low temperature compared with strong daily variation in warm-acclimated fish, suggesting that cold temperatures dampen the cycling of transcriptional rhythms under a simultaneously decreasing day length. Different circadian clock genes had divergent expression patterns, responding either by decreased expression or by increased rhythmicity at 15 degrees C compared with 8 degrees C. The results point out mechanisms that can affect the ability of fish to adapt to increasing temperatures caused by climate change.

However, the technology is not well developed for Clonostachys rosea, a biocontrol agent against various plant pathogens due to its antagonistic capacity to act as a hyperparasite, compete for nutrients and space, and induce plant resistance to pathogens. In this study, we aimed to optimize the culture medium and to standardize parameters that may interfere with the production of C. rosea conidia in a liquid-state fermentation system. Culturing was performed in 250-mL Erlenmeyer flasks shaken for 7 days, followed by planned experimental methodology to reduce the number of analyses and consumable costs. Benchtop bioreactor tests with the optimized medium were performed. Glucose and sucrose were evaluated as carbon sources. Initially, the effects of temperature, pH, photoperiod, carbon: nitrogen ratio and water activity on inoculum production were evaluated, with the pH and photoperiod being factors that contributed to conidial production. Optimization of the fermentation conditions was performed using a central composite rotational design (CCD) with a wider range of pH values and photoperiods. The remaining variables were fixed according to the previous assay. Colony-forming unit (CFUs), biomass production and conidial viability were evaluated, and glucose was used as a carbon source to enhance conidial production. The optimized conditions that resulted in a maximum yield of conidia (1.78 x 10(7) conidia mL(-1)), dried biomass (0.558 g) and CFUs (5.15 x 10(6) CFUs mL(-1)) were a pH value of 4 and a photoperiod of 12 h.

J	Bao, WD; Du, YH; Lin, ZG; Zhu, HP				Bao, Wendi; Du, Yihong; Lin, Zhigui; Zhu, Huaiping			Free boundary models for mosquito range movement driven by climate warming	JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL BIOLOGY												As vectors, mosquitoes transmit numerous mosquito-borne diseases. Among the many factors affecting the distribution and density of mosquitoes, climate change and warming have been increasingly recognized as major ones. In this paper, we make use of three diffusive logistic models with free boundary in one space dimension to explore the impact of climate warming on the movement of mosquito range. First, a general model incorporating temperature change with location and time is introduced. In order to gain insights of the model, a simplified version of the model with the change of temperature depending only on location is analyzed theoretically, for which the dynamical behavior is completely determined and presented. The general model can be modified into a more realistic one of seasonal succession type, to take into account of the seasonal changes of mosquito movements during each year, where the general model applies only for the time period of the warm seasons of the year, and during the cold season, the mosquito range is fixed and the population is assumed to be in a hibernating status. For both the general model and the seasonal succession model, our numerical simulations indicate that the long-time dynamical behavior is qualitatively similar to the simplified model, and the effect of climate warming on the movement of mosquitoes can be easily captured. Moreover, our analysis reveals that hibernating enhances the chances of survival and successful spreading of the mosquitoes, but it slows down the spreading speed.																	0303-6812	1432-1416				MAR	2018	76	4					841	875		10.1007/s00285-017-1159-9								WOS:000425335200003	28726158

A histological study of the skin, hair follicles and moult of the hooded seal (Cystophora cristata [Erxleben, 1777])	POLAR RESEARCH												The aims of this study were to (1) provide a general description of the hooded seal's integument; (2) diagnose hair follicle activity stages and develop a chronology for the annual moult within the different sex and age classes; (3) examine the population characteristics of the moult haul-out; and (4) seek possible correlations between these events and the hooded seal's annual cycle. Skin samples were collected from 68 moulting hooded seals out of 868 taken in the Denmark Strait for population studies during June and July 1972. The microstructure of the integument of this species is described. It varies little from what is known from other northern phocids. However, they appear to be one to two "intermediate" guard hair follicles within up to seven underfur follicles; these are smaller than the main guard hair follicle in each hair follicle complex. The hair follicles in the skin of most hooded seals of both sexes and all ages sampled between 21 June and 11 July 1972 were at early to middle stages of activity, suggesting that hair growth starts somewhat earlier than mid-June and ends later than mid-July. It appears that female moult haul-out numbers started to decline about four to five days earlier than the males, but when the haul-out began or ended could not be determined. The brevity, synchronicity and precision of the moult (and breeding season) suggest that its timing is controlled by an environmental factor such as day length at the high northern latitudes inhabited by hooded seals.																	0800-0395	1751-8369				FEB 15	2018	37								1419906	10.1080/17518369.2017.1419906								WOS:000425732500001

Classifying threatened species of India using IUCN criteria	CURRENT SCIENCE												Assigning threat status to a species is essential for prioritization of species under any conservation programme, and therefore, a pre-requisite for species conservation. In India, due to inadequate data, threat status has not been assigned to several plant species, although their population sizes are quite small and they are considered important from conservation point of view. Besides, there is a need for reassessment of threat status assigned by various agencies using updated data on population size, number of mature individuals, area of occupancy, and geographic extent of occurrence. This is crucial as the natural habitats as well as populations of such species are being affected by anthropogenic activities, exotic species invasion, and climate change. In the present study, we assessed the threat status of 59 selected plant species following the IUCN criteria (ver. 3.1). The species were selected after consultation with various experts throughout the country. Field surveys were carried out in various ecoregions of India to locate the species. Population size and number of mature individuals were enumerated following quadrat/plot-based sampling. The exogenous and endogenous factors leading to decline in population and rarity were identified based on field observations as well as laboratory-based seed viability and germination tests. Based on these studies, 20 species were classified under critically endangered category, 21 under endangered, 11 under vulnerable, five under near threatened, and one species each under data deficient and least concern category. Threat assessment for 41 species was done based on number of locations and geographical range of occurrence, while for 18 species it was done based on restricted population and number of mature individuals. Over-exploitation and habitat degradation or loss were the dominant exogenous factors leading to decline in natural populations of the selected species. The major endogenous factors that lead to population decline and species rarity were low seed viability and germination, long dormancy period, less seedling recruitment, low population size, habitat specificity and narrow niche leading to restricted distribution.																	0011-3891					FEB 10	2018	114	3					588	595		10.18520/cs/v114/i03/588-595								WOS:000424334200034

The wood white (Leptidea sinapis) is a butterfly species distributed across western Eurasia that shows photoperiod-induced diapause with variation in critical day-length across populations at different latitudes. We assembled transcriptomes and estimated gene expression levels at different developmental stages in experimentally induced directly developing and diapausing cohorts of a single Swedish population of L. sinapis to investigate the regulatory mechanisms underpinning diapause initiation. Different day lengths resulted in expression changes of developmental genes and affected the rate of accumulation of signal molecules, suggesting that diapause induction might be controlled by increased activity of monoamine neurotransmitters in larvae reared under short-day light conditions. Expression differences between light treatment groups of two monoamine regulator genes (DDC and ST) were observed already in instar III larvae. Once developmental pathways were irreversibly set at instar V, a handful of genes related to dopamine production were differentially expressed leading to a significant decrease in expression of global metabolic genes and increase in expression of genes related to fatty acid synthesis and sequestration. This is in line with a time-dependent (hour-glass) model of diapause regulation where a gradual shift in the concentration of monoamine neurotransmitters and their metabolites during development of larvae under short-day conditions leads to increased storage of fat, decreased energy expenditures, and ultimately developmental stasis at the pupal stage.																	0962-1083	1365-294X				FEB	2018	27	4					935	948		10.1111/mec.14501								WOS:000428797100010	29411442

Increases in summer temperatures decrease the survival of an invasive forest insect	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Higher temperatures projected under current climate change models are generally predicted to exert an overall positive effect on the success of invasive insects through increased survivability, developmental rates and fecundity, and by facilitating geographic range expansion. However, these effects have primarily focused on the shifts in winter temperatures with limited attention to the role that summer heat may play in shaping species ranges or fitness. We examined the thermal ecology of an ecologically important invasive forest insect, the hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae), by determining survival during its summer dormancy phase under increasing temperature regimens. From laboratory and field experiments, we documented a positive association between increased temperatures and duration of exposure, and A. tsugae mortality. Adelges tsugae mortality was minimal (< 20%) when exposed to summer temperatures characteristic to its native range (< 25 degrees C), but markedly increased (up to 100%) when exposed to temperatures that occur occasionally or rarely in natural settings (> 30 degrees C). At the warmest, southernmost edge of their range, field mortality of A. tsugae ranged from 8.5 to 81.9% and was strongly correlated with site temperature regimens. Further, we found no significant differences in A. tsugae survival between populations collected from Maine and Georgia, and over a 3-year period within Georgia, indicating that A. tsugae may not be acclimating to heat. These results highlight the importance of including summer temperatures in studies regarding increased temperatures on insect dynamics, and may alter historical predictions of climate change impacts on invasive insects and the conservation of forest ecosystems.																	1387-3547	1573-1464				FEB	2018	20	2					365	374		10.1007/s10530-017-1537-7								WOS:000426065700008						
J	Chaves, LF; Jian, JY; Moji, K				Chaves, Luis Fernando; Jian, Jiun-Yu; Moji, Kazuhiko			Overwintering in the Bamboo Mosquito Tripteroides bambusa (Diptera: Culicidae) During a Warm, But Unpredictably Changing, Winter	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												The bamboo mosquito, Tripteroides bambusa (Yamada) (Diptera: Culicidae), is a common insect across forested landscapes in Japan. Several studies have reported its overwintering as larvae and eggs, in both natural and artificial water containers. Nevertheless, it is unclear how sensitive this mosquito species is to changes in weather patterns associated with global warming. The El Nino event of 2015 through 2016 was one of the strongest on record and provided an ideal scenario for observations on the overwintering of the bamboo mosquito during a winter predicted to be unusually warm. Thus, we set oviposition traps in mid October 2015 and made weekly observations, from December 2015 to May 2016, on bamboo mosquito larval recruitment and pupation in Nagasaki, Japan. We found that larvae were pupating as late as the first week of January (prior records from the study site indicated mosquito pupation ended by mid-late October) and that pupation resumed in mid April (one month earlier than previous records at the study site). We also found that fourth instar larvae were able to survive in frozen oviposition traps following an extremely unusual snowstorm and cold spell and that recruitment of larvae from eggs happened after this unusual event. Our analysis suggested that overwintering and metamorphosis of the bamboo mosquito is sensitive to average and extreme temperatures, the latter measured by temperature kurtosis. Our results highlight the need to better understand changes in overwintering strategies in insects, and associated trade-offs and impacts on population dynamics, in light of climate change.

J	Bentz, BJ; Hansen, EM				Bentz, Barbara J.; Hansen, E. Matthew			Evidence for a Prepupal Diapause in the Mountain Pine Beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae)	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												Dormancy strategies, including diapause and quiescence, enable insects to evade adverse conditions and ensure seasonally appropriate life stages. A mechanistic understanding of a species' dormancy is necessary to predict population response in a changing climate. Climate change is influencing distribution patterns and population success of many species, including Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae), the most important mortality agent of pines in western North America. Diapause is considered absent in D. ponderosae, and quiescence in the final larval stage prior to pupation (i.e., prepupal) is considered the main dormancy strategy. We evaluated if a facultative diapause in the prepupal stage, rather than a pupation threshold similar to 15 degrees C (i.e., quiescence), could describe pupation patterns in two latitudinally separated D. ponderosae populations in the western United States. We hypothesized that if pupation occurs at lower temperatures than previously described, and if significant prepupal developmental delays occur, diapause is a likely physiological mechanism. Although there was considerable variation within and between populations, pupation occurred below the previously established threshold suggesting a prepupal facultative diapause that is induced when late instars experience cool temperatures. Individuals that pupated at temperatures below 15 degrees C also had developmental delays, relative to development at warmer temperatures, consistent with diapause development. Pupation patterns differed between populations wherein diapause was induced at cooler temperatures and diapause development was shorter in southern compared with northern D. ponderosae. Recognition of a facultative diapause that varies among and between populations is critical for making predictions about future population response and range expansion in a changing climate.																	0046-225X	1938-2936				FEB	2018	47	1					175	183		10.1093/ee/nvx192								WOS:000424914000022	29293921

We use matrix population models from 454 plant and animal populations to simulate stochastic population growth rates (log lambda(s)) under different temporal autocorrelations in demographic rates, using simulated and observed covariation among rates. We then test for differences in sensitivities, or changes of log lambda(s) to changes in autocorrelation among two major axes of life-history strategies, obtained from phylogenetically informed principal component analysis: the fast-slow and reproductive-strategy continua. Fast life histories exhibit highest sensitivities to simulated autocorrelation in demographic rates across reproductive strategies. Slow life histories are less sensitive to temporal autocorrelation, but their sensitivities increase among highly iteroparous species. We provide cross-taxonomic evidence that changes in the autocorrelation of environmental variation may affect a wide range of species, depending on complex interactions of life-history strategies.

Shifting relative importance of climatic constraints on land surface phenology	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Land surface phenology (LSP), the study of seasonal dynamics of vegetated land surfaces from remote sensing, is a key indicator of global change, that both responds to and influences weather and climate. The effects of climatic changes on LSP depend on the relative importance of climatic constraints in specific regions-which are not well understood at global scale. Understanding the climatic constraints that underlie LSP is crucial for explaining climate change effects on global vegetation phenology. We used a combination of modelled and remotely-sensed vegetation activity records to quantify the interplay of three climatic constraints on land surface phenology (namely minimum temperature, moisture availability, and photoperiod), as well as the dynamic nature of these constraints. Our study examined trends and the relative importance of the three constrains at the start and the end of the growing season over eight global environmental zones, for the past three decades. Our analysis revealed widespread shifts in the relative importance of climatic constraints in the temperate and boreal biomes during the 1982-2011 period. These changes in the relative importance of the three climatic constraints, which ranged up to 8% since 1982 levels, varied with latitude and between start and end of the growing season. We found a reduced influence of minimum temperature on start and end of season in all environmental zones considered, with a biome-dependent effect on moisture and photoperiod constraints. For the end of season, we report that the influence of moisture has on average increased for both the temperate and boreal biomes over 8.99 million km(2). A shifting relative importance of climatic constraints on LSP has implications both for understanding changes and for improving how they may be modelled at large scales.																	1748-9326					FEB	2018	13	2							024025	10.1088/1748-9326/aaa17b								WOS:000425019000001

Inverse European Latitudinal Cline at the timeless Locus of Drosophila melanogaster Reveals Selection on a Clock Gene: Population Genetics of ls-tim	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL RHYTHMS												The spread of adaptive genetic variants in populations is a cornerstone of evolutionary theory but with relatively few biologically well-understood examples. Previous work on the ls-tim variant of timeless, which encodes the light-sensitive circadian regulator in Drosophila melanogaster, suggests that it may have originated in southeastern Italy. Flies characterized by the new allele show photoperiod-related phenotypes likely to be adaptive in seasonal environments. ls-tim may be spreading from its point of origin in Italy by directional selection, but there are alternative explanations for its observed clinal geographical distribution, including balancing selection and demography. From population analyses of ls-tim frequencies collected on the eastern side of the Iberian Peninsula, we show that ls-tim frequencies are inverted compared with those in Italy. This pattern is consistent with a scenario of directional selection rather than latitude-associated balancing selection. Neutrality tests further reveal the signature of directional selection at the ls-tim site, which is reduced a few kb pairs either side of ls-tim. A reanalysis of allele frequencies from a large number of microsatellite loci do not demonstrate any frequent ls-tim-like spatial patterns, so a general demographic effect or population expansion from southeastern Italy cannot readily explain current ls-tim frequencies. Finally, a revised estimate of the age of ls-tim allele using linkage disequilibrium and coalescent-based approaches reveals that it may be only 300 to 3000 years old, perhaps explaining why it has not yet gone to fixation. ls-tim thus provides a rare temporal snapshot of a new allele that has come under selection before it reaches equilibrium.

Here, we show that their input synapses undergo daily regulation. We discovered daily variation in the frequencies, but not the peak amplitudes, of miniature postsynaptic currents (mPSCs) for both glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses. In addition, the changes in the frequencies of mPSCs from glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses were antiphasic: An increase in the glutamatergic mPSC frequency and a decrease in the GABAergic mPSC frequency co-occurred during the dark phase of the light-dark cycle. Through optogenetic stimulation of presynaptic glutamatergic axonal terminals, we demonstrated that the elicited quantal size glutamatergic PSC could evoke action potentials in postsynaptic SCN neurons with higher probability during the light phase than during the dark phase. To investigate whether the intrinsic clock or the light-dark cycle mediates the daily rhythm of input synapses, we examined the mPSCs under light masking and skeleton photoperiod schemes. A prolonged light pulse (3 h) at the beginning of the subjective night suppressed the changes in mPSCs frequencies for both glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses; under the skeleton photoperiod, no significant differences were observed in mPSCs frequencies between the subjective day and night. Furthermore, we discovered that the plasticity of these concurrent quantal events occurred primarily in vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) neurons. This work provides evidence for light-dependent synaptic plasticity at glutamatergic and GABAergic input synapses of ventral SCN neurons. This concurrent synaptic plasticity could serve as one mechanism for regulating the responsiveness of SCN neurons to the wide range of light input over the day and night.

Circadian genes polymorphism and breeding phenology in a resident bird, the yellow-legged gull	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												In species living in seasonally variable environments, the ability to synchronize the timing of breeding with the peak of critical resources is under positive selection within populations. The temporal scheduling of animal annual cycle is controlled by endogenous rhythms, which are set by circadian clock' genes. Many studies have supported the hypothesis that length polymorphism in some phenological genes' is associated with differences in the photoperiodic responses among individuals and populations. However, evidence is inconsistent across species, genes and phenological traits. Among birds, there is a dearth of knowledge concerning the gene-phenotype association in non-migratory species. To contribute filling this gap, here we analyzed clutch initiation date of females of a species resident at temperate latitudes, the yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis), in relation to the length polymorphism at four loci previously associated with breeding and migration phenology in other species: Adcyap1 and Npas2 genes, as well as two regions of the Clock gene. Although polymorphism was observed at three loci, allele size of the candidate genes seems not to predict the timing of breeding in females. In addition, similar genotype frequencies of all the analyzed genes were observed in early compared to late breeding females. Our results therefore suggest that the associations between photoperiodic candidate genes and breeding phenotype are not general across species and might represent adaptations of individual populations to the local environment.

Omnivores can exploit a range of different food resources over the course of a year, but they often rely on seasonally restricted highly nutritious fruiting bodies during critical life stages. Brown bears Ursus arctos in Sweden are dependent on berries for fattening before entering hibernation. We used a ten-year time series to evaluate the effect of temperature and snow on annual variation in berry abundance and how this variation affected bears. We found marked interannual variation in berry production of bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus and lingonberry V. vitis-idaea, that we could attribute in part to temperature during plant dormancy and flowering and precipitation during fruit ripening. Both, autumn weights of female bears and spring weights of yearling bears increased linearly with bilberry abundance. When bilberry abundance was low, lightweight female bears had a lower reproductive success than females in better condition. This effect vanished when food abundance was above average, indicating that lightweight females could compensate for their initial weight during good bilberry years. Our study highlights the importance of considering individuals' dynamic responses to variation in food availability, which leave some more vulnerable to food shortage than others. Individual life-history heterogeneity in response to resource variation likely affects long-term population recruitment. Our findings emphasize that Scandinavian bears can be dependent on a single food resource during a critical period of the year and are therefore less resilient to environmental change than expected for an omnivore. Future climate scenarios predict ambiguous trends for weather covariates that affected crucial stages of berry phenology, preventing a clear prognosis of how climate change may affect long-term bilberry production.																	0030-1299	1600-0706				FEB	2018	127	2					197	207		10.1111/oik.04515								WOS:000423848100003

Non-migratory monarch butterflies, Danaus plexippus (L.), retain developmental plasticity and a navigational mechanism associated with migration	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY												Monarch butterflies are best known from their migratory North American range, although many resident, year-round breeding populations are established throughout the world. Here, we evaluate two non-exclusive hypotheses for the loss of migration in resident monarch populations: (1) absence of cues that trigger migration; and (2) loss of sensory, neural or physiological systems required for migration. To evaluate the first hypothesis, we exposed resident monarchs from Queensland, Australia to decreasing larval photoperiod and observed reproductive development in resulting females to assess their propensity to show reduced reproductive development, a precursor for long-distance migration. To address the second hypothesis, we measured antennal circadian clock gene expression, a crucial element of the monarch's ability to orientate directionally, in a resident and a migratory population. We found that Australian resident monarchs show reduced reproductive development in response to decreasing photoperiod, consistent with the 'loss of cues' hypothesis. We found no differences in antennal clock gene expression between migratory and resident populations, inconsistent with the 'loss of mechanism' hypothesis. Together, these data indicate that even after hundreds of generations of non-migration, monarchs retain two crucial elements of their migratory repertoire: developmental plasticity associated with decreasing photoperiod and antennal circadian rhythms necessary for directional orientation.

Dispersal behavior of yellowjacket (Vespula germanica) queens	INSECT SCIENCE												Understanding the factors that affect animal dispersal behavior is important from both fundamental and applied perspectives. Dispersal can have clear evolutionary and ecological consequences, but for nonnative insect pests, dispersal capacity can also help to explain invasion success. Vespula germanica is a social wasp that, in the last century, has successfully invaded several regions of the world, showing one of the highest spread rates reported for a nonnative insect. In contrast with nonsocial wasps, in social species, queens are responsible for population redistribution and spread, as workers are sterile. For V. germanica, it has been observed that queen flight is limited to 2 distinct periods: early autumn, when new queens leave the nest to mate and find sheltered places in which to hibernate, and spring when new colonies are founded. Our aim was to study the flight behavior of V. germanica queens by focusing on the different periods in which dispersal occurs, characterizing as well the potential contribution of queen flight (i.e., distance) to the observed geographical spread. Our results suggest that the distances flown by nonover-wintered queens is greater than that flown by overwintered individuals, suggesting that the main queen dispersal events would occur before queens enter hibernation. This could relate to a behavioral trait of the queens to avoid the inbreeding with related drones. Additionally, given the short distances flown and remarkable geographical spread observed, we provide evidence showing that queen dispersal by flight is likely to contribute proportionately less to population spread than human-aided factors.

Warmer winter temperatures are driving reduced snowpack in the western USA with broad potential impacts on ecosystem dynamics of particular concern for protected areas. Vegetation phenology is a sensitive indicator of ecological response to climate change and is associated with snowmelt timing. Human monitoring of climate impacts can be resource prohibitive for land management agencies, whereas remotely sensed phenology observations are freely available at a range of spatiotemporal scales. Little work has been done in regions dominated by evergreen conifer cover, which represents many mountain regions at temperate latitudes. We used moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data to assess the influence of snowmelt timing and elevation on five phenology metrics (green up, maximum greenness, senescence, dormancy, and growing season length) within Crater Lake National Park, Oregon, USA from 2001 to 2012. Earlier annual mean snowmelt timing was significantly correlated with earlier onset of green up at the landscape scale. Snowmelt timing and elevation have significant explanatory power for phenology, though with high variability. Elevation has a moderate control on early season indicators such as snowmelt timing and green up and less on late-season variables such as senescence and growing season length. PCA results show that early season indicators and late season indicators vary independently. These results have important implications for ecosystem dynamics, management, and conservation, particularly of species such as whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) in alpine and subalpine areas.																	0020-7128	1432-1254				FEB	2018	62	2					273	285		10.1007/s00484-017-1449-3								WOS:000423319100013	28965255

Environmental conditions for Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae) take-off	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY												Environmental factors that influence flight activity of Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae) may have implications for Huanglongbing spread and management. In this work, four studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of environmental conditions on D.citri take-off. In the first, insects were transferred to sweet orange seedlings and confined inside an acrylic cage to verify the take-off periodicity and the effect of environmental factors on this process. In the second, take-off temperature threshold was estimated by recording the number of insects that initiated flight from a platform when subjected to gradual temperature increases from 15 to 39 degrees C. In the other studies, we evaluated the effect of different photoperiods and temperature regimes (third study) and of constant temperatures (fourth study) on the propensity for D.citri flight. Insects were confined in clear plastic bottle cages with tubes of 50ml placed on the cab, to collect emerged adults that initiated flights. Results showed that a small portion of the tested population (maximum 10%) tends to take off from plants and this behaviour is more prevalent in the afternoon (14:00-16:00h), coinciding with daytimes of lower humidity and higher thermal amplitude. Adults that were submitted to lower temperatures (18 degrees C) and short light periods (10h) showed less propensity to flight. In contrast, at constant 27 degrees C, the insects were more prone to flight, and this result was confirmed when individuals were submitted to increases in temperature, indicating that 27.14 degrees C is the take-off temperature threshold of D.citri. Results show that temperature plays an important role in the flight activity of D.citri and suggest that control measures of the insect may be more effective in the morning and in temperatures below 27 degrees C, when the probability to take off from a host is lower.

Evolutionary transition from blood feeding to obligate nonbiting in a mosquito	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												The spread of blood-borne pathogens by mosquitoes relies on their taking a blood meal; if there is no bite, there is no disease transmission. Although many species of mosquitoes never take a blood meal, identifying genes that distinguish blood feeding from obligate nonbiting is hampered by the fact that these different lifestyles occur in separate, genetically incompatible species. There is, however, one unique extant species with populations that share a common genetic background but blood feed in one region and are obligate nonbiters in the rest of their range: Wyeomyia smithii. Contemporary blood-feeding and obligate nonbiting populations represent end points of divergence between fully interfertile southern and northern populations. This divergence has undoubtedly resulted in genetic changes that are unrelated to blood feeding, and the challenge is to winnow out the unrelated genetic factors to identify those related specifically to the evolutionary transition from blood feeding to obligate nonbiting. Herein, we determine differential gene expression resulting from directional selection on blood feeding within a polymorphic population to isolate genetic differences between blood feeding and obligate nonbiting. We show that the evolution of nonbiting has resulted in a greatly reduced metabolic investment compared with biting populations, a greater reliance on opportunistic metabolic pathways, and greater reliance on visual rather than olfactory sensory input. W. smithii provides a unique starting point to determine if there are universal nonbiting genes in mosquitoes that could be manipulated as a means to control vector-borne disease.

The trade in second-hand tires has been implicated as a factor in this process because they act as mobile reservoirs of mosquito eggs and larvae. Regional transportation of tires can create linkages between rural areas with dengue and disease-free urban areas, potentially giving rise to outbreaks even in areas with strong local control measures. In this work we sought to model the dynamics of mosquito transportation via the tire trade, in particular to predict its role in causing unexpected dengue outbreaks through vertical transmission of the virus across generations of mosquitoes. We also aimed to identify strategies for regulating the trade in second-hand tires, improving disease control. We created a mathematical model which captures the dynamics of dengue between rural and urban areas, taking into account the movement and storage time of tires, and mosquito diapause. We simulate a series of scenarios in which a mosquito population is introduced to a dengue-free area via movement of tires, either as single or multiple events, increasing the likelihood of a dengue outbreak. A persistent disease state can be induced regardless of whether urban conditions for an outbreak are met, and an existing endemic state can be enhanced by vector input. Finally we assess the potential for regulation of tire processing as a means of reducing the transmission of dengue fever using a specific case study from Puerto Rico. Our work demonstrates the importance of the second-hand tire trade in modulating the spread of dengue fever across regions, in particular its role in introducing dengue to disease-free areas. We propose that reduction of tire storage time and control of their movement can play a crucial role in containing dengue outbreaks. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

RBiomirGS: an all-in-one miRNA gene set analysis solution featuring target mRNA mapping and expression profile integration	PEERJ												Background. With the continuous discovery of microRNAs (miRNA) association with a wide range of biological and cellular processes, expression profile-based functional characterization of such post-transcriptional regulation is crucial for revealing its significance behind particular phenotypes. Profound advancement in bioinformatics has been made to enable in depth investigation of miRNAs role in regulating cellular and molecular events, resulting in a huge quantity of software packages covering different aspects of miRNA functional analysis. Therefore, an all-in-one software solution is in demand for a comprehensive yet highly efficient workflow. Here we present RBiomirGS, an R package for a miRNA gene set (GS) analysis. Methods. The package utilizes multiple databases for target mRNA mapping, estimates miRNA effect on the target mRNAs through miRNA expression profile and conducts a logistic regression-based GS enrichment. Additionally, human ortholog Entrez ID conversion functionality is included for target mRNAs. Results. By incorporating all the core steps into one package, RBiomirGS eliminates the need for switching between different software packages. The modular structure of RBiomirGS enables various access points to the analysis, with which users can choose the most relevant functionalities for their workflow. Conclusions. With RBiomirGS, users are able to assess the functional significance of the miRNA expression profile under the corresponding experimental condition by minimal input and intervention. Accordingly, RBiomirGS encompasses an all-in-one solution for miRNA GS analysis. RBiomirGS is available on GitHub (http://github.com/jzhangc/RBiomirGS).

This feat defies the rule that crops are inhibited from spreading easily across latitudes. How the widespread latitudinal adaptation of maize was accomplished is largely unknown. Through positional cloning and association mapping, we resolved a flowering-time quantitative trait locus to a Harbinger-like transposable element positioned 57 kb upstream of a CCT transcription factor (ZmCCT9). The Harbinger-like element acts in c/s to repress ZmCCT9 expression to promote flowering under long days. Knockout of ZmCCT9 by CRISPR/Cas9 causes early flowering under long days. ZmCCT9 is diurnally regulated and negatively regulates the expression of the florigen ZCN8, thereby resulting in late flowering under long days. Population genetics analyses revealed that the Harbinger-like transposon insertion at ZmCCT9 and the CACTA-like transposon insertion at another CCT paralog, ZmCCTIO, arose sequentially following domestication and were targeted by selection for maize adaptation to higher latitudes. Our findings help explain how the dynamic maize genome with abundant transposon activity enabled maize to adapt over 90 degrees of latitude during the pre-Columbian era.																	0027-8424					JAN 9	2018	115	2					E334	E341		10.1073/pnas.1718058115								WOS:000419686400030	29279404

The experiments were carried out at three different, temperatures (17, 22 and 27 +/- 1 degrees C) for each aphid species, 60 +/- 10% RH and 16: 8 h L:D photoperiod. The development thresholds and thermal constants for the parasitoid were also determined for the three aphid species. The parasitization rate of L. testaceipes was 25.0, 53.4 and 20.5% (for 17, 22 and 27 degrees C, respectively) for A. craccivora; 62.7, 71.1 and 37.1% for A. fabae; and 54.2, 70.7 and 20.0% for A. gossypii. The development time of L. testaceipes was 18.5, 10.9 and 7.9 d in A. craccivora, 17.6, 10.2 and 7.4 d in A. fabae, and 19.8, 12.6 and 9.3 d in A. gossypii at 17, 22 and 27 +/- 1 degrees C. The development thresholds and thermal constants for L. testaceipes in A. craccivora, A. fabae and A. gossypii were 9.42, 9.69 and 8.12 degrees C, and 136.99, 128.05 and 175.44 degree days, respectively. Based on the overall results, A. fabae is an excellent potential host for the mass rearing of L. testaceipes at 20-22 degrees C.																	1010-6960						2018	42	1					43	52		10.16970/entoted.376293								WOS:000433021100005

Two biotypes are available for release and come from significantly different centres of origin. The Nepalese biotype was collected at higher altitude and latitude sites, whereas the Chinese biotype was collected at slightly lower latitude and lower altitude. We hypothesised that Nepalese beetles would survive winter better in north Florida and that Chinese beetles would overwinter better in subtropical south Florida. We established sites in Homestead, Fort Pierce, Gainesville and Tallahassee, Florida to gauge the overwintering survival of each biotype. Beetles that overwintered in each site for one to three seasons were collected and followed to assess their reproductive capacity. In the final year of the experiment, we extracted fat bodies to determine effects of biotype and site. Nepalese beetles overwintered significantly better overall. Beetles survived better in the first study year (2013-2014). Both biotypes reproduced very well after surviving winter and beetles in Fort Pierce survived better than beetles in other regions and maintained a higher fat body. Nepalese beetles may have a wider ecological envelope - a decided advantage for a large region such as peninsular Florida. We suggest that current release programmes incorporate Nepalese beetles into their protocol to increase overwinter survival and establishment.																	0958-3157	1360-0478					2018	28	3					293	306		10.1080/09583157.2018.1441371								WOS:000428240600007

NEW NORTH AMERICAN RECORDS FOR THE OLD WORLD PSYLLID HETEROTRIOZA CHENOPODII (REUTER) (HEMIPTERA: PSYLLOIDEA: TRIOZIDAE) WITH BIOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF WASHINGTON												The Palearctic psyllid Heterotrioza chenopodii (Reuter) (Hemiptera: Psylloidea: Triozidae) belongs to a complex of psyllids having plants in the Amaranthaceae (including the former Chenopodiaceae) as hosts. Geographic records for this introduced species in North America date from 1988, and include a number of coastal regions in eastern Canada, the Northeastern U.S., inland Virginia, coastal British Columbia, California, and wetland habitats near Lincoln, Nebraska. We updated North American records for H. chenopodii to include inland Washington and Oregon, southwestern Idaho, northcentral California, western Colorado, and southern and central Alberta. Psyllids were collected from Atriplex micrantha (Amaranthaceae) and unidentified Atriplex species, and from yellow sticky cards that had been placed in potato fields to monitor arthropod pests of potatoes. Traits of the adult psyllid, fifth-instar nymph, and egg used in identifying specimens are summarized. We provide the first photographs of the egg, fifth-instar nymph, and terminalia of the adult male psyllid. Rearing trials showed that H. chenopodii developed on A. micrantha, A. hortensis, Chenopodium album, C. berlandieri, and garden beet, Beta vulgaris, but failed to develop on Amaranthus tricolor. Development was most rapid on the two Atriplex species. Heterotrioza chenopodii has been shown in Europe to exhibit photoperiod-controlled dimorphism in wing size, producing a long-winged form in spring and summer, and a short-winged form in autumn. We confirmed in rearing trials and by field collections that populations of H. chenopodii from central Washington State also exhibit this dimorphism. Short-winged forms began replacing long-winged forms in field populations between late August and early October.																	0013-8797					JAN	2018	120	1					134	152		10.4289/0013-8797.120.1.134								WOS:000427503300007

The uptake of ozone by forest is estimated through several meteorological variables and a specific function describing the beginning and the termination of plant growing season; actually, in many risk assessment studies, this function is based on a simple latitude and topography model. In this study, using two satellite datasets, we apply and compare six methods to estimate the start and the end dates of the growing season across a large region covering all Europe for the year 2011. Results show a large variability between the green-up and dormancy dates estimated using the six different methods, with differences greater than one month. However, interestingly, all the methods display a common spatial pattern in the uptake of ozone by forests with a marked change in the magnitude, up to 1.9 TgO(3)/year, and corresponding to a difference of 25% in the amount of ozone that enters the leaves. Our results indicate that improved estimates of ozone fluxes require a better representation of plant phenology in the models used for O-3 risk assessment.

Contrasting physiological responses to future ocean acidification among Arctic copepod populations	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Widespread ocean acidification (OA) is modifying the chemistry of the global ocean, and the Arctic is recognized as the region where the changes will progress at the fastest rate. Moreover, Arctic species show lower capacity for cellular homeostasis and acid-base regulation rendering them particularly vulnerable to OA. In the present study, we found physiological differences in OA response across geographically separated populations of the keystone Arctic copepod Calanus glacialis. In copepodites stage CIV, measured reaction norms of ingestion rate and metabolic rate showed severe reductions in ingestion and increased metabolic expenses in two populations from Svalbard (Kongsfjord and Billefjord) whereas no effects were observed in a population from the Disko Bay, West Greenland. At pHT 7.87, which has been predicted for the Svalbard west coast by year 2100, these changes resulted in reductions in scope for growth of 19% in the Kongsfjord and a staggering 50% in the Billefjord. Interestingly, these effects were not observed in stage CV copepodites from any of the three locations. It seems that CVs may be more tolerant to OA perhaps due to a general physiological reorganization to meet low intracellular pH during hibernation. Needless to say, the observed changes in the CIV stage will have serious implications for the C. glacialis population health status and growth around Svalbard. However, OA tolerant populations such as the one in the Disko Bay could help to alleviate severe effects in C. glacialis as a species.

In addition, they provide key empirical data that may be used in predictive modelling to forecast evolutionary responses of natural ecosystems to future environmental changes. However, excluding a few exceptional cases, long-term studies are scarce because of logistic difficulties associated with accessing temporal samples. Temporal dynamics are frequently studied in the laboratory or in controlled mesocosm experiments with exceptional studies that reconstruct the evolution of natural populations in the wild. Here, a standard operating procedure (SOP) is provided to revive or resurrect dormant Daphnia magna, a widespread zooplankton keystone species in aquatic ecosystems, to dramatically advance the state-of-the-art longitudinal data collection in natural systems. The field of Resurrection Ecology was defined in 1999 by Kerfoot and co-workers, even though the first attempts at hatching diapausing zooplankton eggs date back to the late 1980s. Since Kerfoot's seminal paper, the methodology of resurrecting zooplankton species has been increasingly frequently applied, though propagated among laboratories only via direct knowledge transfer. Here, an SOP is described that provides a step-by-step protocol on the practice of resurrecting dormant Daphnia magna eggs. Two key studies are provided in which the fitness response of resurrected Daphnia magna populations to warming is measured, capitalizing on the ability to study historical and modern populations in the same settings. Finally, the application of next generation sequencing technologies to revived or still dormant stages is discussed. These technologies provide unprecedented power in dissecting the processes and mechanisms of evolution if applied to populations that have experienced changes in selection pressure over time.

Although considerable work has been invested in trying to understand each of the major diapause stages (induction, maintenance and termination), we know very little about the transitions between stages, especially diapause termination. Understanding diapause termination is crucial for modelling and predicting spring emergence and winter physiology of insects, including many pest insects. In order to gain these insights, we investigated metabolome dynamics across diapause development in pupae of the butterfly Pieris napi, which exhibits adaptive latitudinal variation in the length of endogenous diapause that is uniquely well characterized. By employing a time-series experiment, we show that the whole-body metabolome is highly dynamic throughout diapause and differs between pupae kept at a diapause-terminating (low) temperature and those kept at a diapause-maintaining (high) temperature. We showmajor physiological transitions through diapause, separate temperature-dependent from temperature-independent processes and identify significant patterns of metabolite accumulation and degradation. Together, the data show that although the general diapause phenotype (suppressed metabolism, increased cold tolerance) is established in a temperature-independent fashion, diapause termination is temperature dependent and requires a cold signal. This revealed several metabolites that are only accumulated under diapause-terminating conditions and degraded in a temperature-unrelated fashion during diapause termination. In conclusion, our findings indicate that some metabolites, in addition to functioning as cryoprotectants, for example, are candidates for having regulatory roles as metabolic clocks or time-keepers during diapause.

Such maps provide important starting points for neuron classification, for functional analysis, and for developmental studies aimed at defining the molecular mechanisms of neuron identity acquisition and neuron identity diversification. In this resource paper, we describe a nervous system-wide map of the potential expression sites of 244 members of the largest gene family in the C. elegans genome, rhodopsin-like (class A) G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) chemoreceptors, using classic gfp reporter gene technology. We cover representatives of all sequence families of chemoreceptor GPCRs, some of which were previously entirely uncharacterized. Most reporters are expressed in a very restricted number of cells, often just in single cells. We assign GPCR reporter expression to all but two of the 37 sensory neuron classes of the sex-shared, core nervous system. Some sensory neurons express a very small number of receptors, while others, particularly nociceptive neurons, coexpress several dozen GPCR reporter genes. GPCR reporters are also expressed in a wide range of inter- and motorneurons, as well as non-neuronal cells, suggesting that GPCRs may constitute receptors not just for environmental signals, but also for internal cues. We observe only one notable, frequent association of coexpression patterns, namely in one nociceptive amphid (ASH) and two nociceptive phasmid sensory neurons (PHA, PHB). We identified GPCRs with sexually dimorphic expression and several GPCR reporters that are expressed in a left/right asymmetric manner. We identified a substantial degree of GPCR expression plasticity; particularly in the context of the environmentally-induced dauer diapause stage when one third of all tested GPCRs alter the cellular specificity of their expression within and outside the nervous system. Intriguingly, in a number of cases, the dauer-specific alterations of GPCR reporter expression in specific neuron classes are maintained during postdauer life and in some case new patterns are induced post-dauer, demonstrating that GPCR gene expression may serve as traits of life history. Taken together, our resource provides an entry point for functional studies and also offers a host of molecular markers for studying molecular patterning and plasticity of the nervous system.

J	Bonada, N; Doledec, S				Bonada, Nuria; Doledec, Sylvain			Does the Tachet trait database report voltinism variability of aquatic insects between Mediterranean and Scandinavian regions?	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Labile traits are those that are not constrained by phylogeny and should respond directly to the environment through local adaptation or phenotypic plasticity. For example, voltinism (number of generations per year) is a labile trait that has been consistently related to latitude and, in particular, to temperature and photoperiod changes. Current trait databases include several labile traits that, at best, are coarsely coded to include potential intraspecific trait variability obtained from different literature sources. Given that these databases are used across large regions with contrasting environmental conditions or in small regions with particular environmental conditions, the reliability of these studies could be compromised at least for labile traits because of interpopulation variability. Based on a review of the literature on the life cycles of 317 aquatic insect species, we compared their types of voltinism in two regions with contrasting environmental conditions (the Mediterranean Basin and Scandinavia) with the information published by Tachet et al. (Invertebres d'eau douce: systematique, biologie, ecologie, 3rd edn. CNRS Editions, Paris, 2010) (i.e., potential number of generations per year). We found the expected higher prevalence of multivoltine life cycles in the Mediterranean Basin, whereas univoltine and semivoltine life cycles showed trends of prominence in Scandinavia. In addition, the life-cycle profiles of the genera included in the Tachet et al. database (hereafter TAC) were situated between those found in the Mediterranean Basin and Scandinavia, suggesting that this database properly represents voltinism variability across Europe. However, the use of this database exclusively for the northern or southern regions may be challenging because TAC is not able to accurately represent the life cycles of the species in these regions, especially for univoltine and multivoltine species. Future studies in stream ecology should thus put efforts into quantifying and understanding the role of intra-taxon trait variability in community assembly, at least for labile traits, to better understand trait-environment relationships.

These changes are originally caused by the effect of the Earth's cycles around the sun and its axial tilt. Examples of seasonal responses include flotation, migration, reproduction and diapause. In temperate climate zones, the most robust variable to predict seasons is the length of the day (i.e. the photoperiod). The first step to trigger photoperiodic driven responses involves measuring the duration of the light-dark phases, but the molecular clockwork performing this task is poorly characterized. Photopigments such as opsins are known to participate in light perception, being part of the machinery in charge of providing information about the luminous state of the surroundings. Aphids (Hemiptera: Aphididae) are paradigmatic photoperiodic insects, exhibiting a strong induction to diapause when the light regime mimics autumn conditions. The availability of the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum) genome has facilitated molecular approaches to understand the effect of light stimulus in the photoperiodic induction process. We have identified, experimentally validated and characterized the expression of the full opsin gene repertoire in the pea aphid. Among identified opsin genes in A. pisum, arthropsin is absent in most insects sequenced to date (except for dragonflies and two other hemipterans) but also present in a crustacean, an onychophoran and chelicerates. We have quantified the expression of these genes in aphids exposed to different photoperiodic conditions and at different times of the day and localized their transcripts in the aphid brain. Clear differences in expression patterns were found, thus relating opsin expression with the photoperiodic response.

Seasonal variation in the thermal responses to changing environmental temperature in the world's northernmost land bird	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY												Arctic homeotherms counter challenges at high latitudes using a combination of seasonal adjustments in pelage/plumage, fat deposition and intricate thermoregulatory adaptations. However, there are still gaps in our understanding of their thermal responses to cold, particularly in Arctic birds. Here, we have studied the potential use of local heterothermy (i.e. tissue cooling that can contribute to significantly lower heat loss rate) in Svalbard ptarmigan (Lagopus muta hyperborea) - the world's northernmost land bird. We exposed birds kept under simulated Svalbard photoperiod to low ambient temperatures (T-a; between 0 and -30 degrees C) during three seasons (early winter, late winter, summer), whilst recording resting metabolic rate (RMR), core temperature (T-c) and several cutaneous temperatures. Leg skin temperature varied the most, but still only by up to similar to 15 degrees C, whereas body trunk skin temperature changed < 1 degrees C when T-a decreased from 0 to -30 degrees C. At the same time, Tc increased by 0.9 degrees C, concomitant with increased RMR. This was probably driven by the triggering of cerebral thermosensors in response to cooling of the poorly insulated head, the skin of which was 5.4 degrees C colder at -30 degrees C than at 0 degrees C. Thermal conductance in winter was higher in yearlings, probably because they were time/resource constrained from acquiring a high-quality plumage and sufficient fat reserves as a result of concomitant body growth. In conclusion, Svalbard ptarmigan do not employ extensive local heterothermy for cold protection but instead rely on efficient thermogenesis combined with excellent body insulation. Hence, cold defence in the world's northernmost land bird is not mechanistically much different from that of its lower latitude relatives.																	0022-0949	1477-9145				JAN	2018	221	1							UNSP jeb171124	10.1242/jeb.171124								WOS:000419924000026

Seed size-mediated dormancy thresholds: a case for the selective pressure of fire on physically dormant species	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY												In physically dormant species, fire-generated heat breaks seed dormancy, with dormancy-breaking temperature thresholds varying among species. Fire-related heating decreases with depth, due to the insulating effects of soil. Concurrently, smaller-seeded species are restricted to germinating near the surface because of limited reserves within such seeds. We hypothesized that dormancy-breaking temperature thresholds of physically dormant species would be higher in smaller-seeded species, to ensure emergence is restricted to shallower soil depths, and that seed survivorship would follow the same pattern. This was tested experimentally for 14 species from south-eastern Australia, and by using a larger data set of species compiled from the literature to assess if any patterns hold across a broader group. Seed size was negatively related to dormancy-breaking temperature thresholds. Mortality at 100 degrees C showed a positive relationship with seed size. Our findings suggest that small-seeded species are subject to fire-related selection pressure that results in higher dormancy-breaking temperature thresholds and resistant to hotter temperatures, which may act as a depth detection mechanism. By using a broader range of species, we highlight that this relationship is strong and representative of species across a number of phylogenetic groups.																	0024-4066	1095-8312				JAN	2018	123	1					135	143		10.1093/biolinnean/blx117								WOS:000419609000013

Defoliation Intensity and Simulated Grazing Strategy Effects on Three C4 Rangeland Bunchgrasses	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT												Defoliation intensity and timing are two important factors determining plants response to grazing. These factors can be managed by adjusting stocking rate and applying a grazing strategy. In a 6-yr clipping experiment conducted in northwestern Argentina, we assessed the effect of different defoliation intensities (similar to 30%, similar to 50%, and similar to 70% removal of the annually produced aboveground biomass) and simulated grazing strategies (continuous grazing, two-paddock rest-rotation, three-paddock rest-rotation, dormant season grazing) on plots of three C4 native bunchgrasses (Pappophorum vaginatum, Trichloris crinita, and Digitaria californica). Response variables were mean and trend of clipped-off biomass during the 6 yr of treatments, number of inflorescences, and aboveground biomass produced on the year following treatments end (to evaluate residual effect of treatments). Results were species dependent. Mean clipped-off biomass increased with defoliation intensity in T. crinita and D. californica. However, defoliation intensity negatively affected clipped-off biomass trend in T. crinita and the production of P. vaginatumand T. crinita during "residual effect" evaluation. The three species responded positively at least in one response variable to the amount of rest periods in the grazing strategy. Our results are not fully consistent with the concept that forage production is more influenced by defoliation intensity than by grazing strategy: In two of the three species, grazing strategy presented greater impact on response variables than defoliation intensity. When significant "defoliation intensity x grazing strategy" was detected, intensity tended to be more detrimental as grazing strategy allows fewer rest periods. We observed a residual effect of treatments in the three species (generally, negative effect of defoliation intensity and positive effect of grazing strategies with more rest periods). Our results show that dormant season utilization and rest periods are beneficial for maximizing mean clipped-off biomass and ensuring clipped-off biomass trend. High defoliation intensities can maximize short-term clipped-off biomass, but it may produce negative residual effects and trends. (C) 2017 The Society for Range Management.

Low and high thermal tolerance characteristics for unfed larvae of the winter tick Dermacentor albipictus (Acari: Ixodidae) with special reference to moose	TICKS AND TICK-BORNE DISEASES												We report that larvae of the winter tick Dermacentor albipictus, the only stage that will quest for a host, can tolerate short-term cold shock down to -25 degrees C and short-term heat shock as high as 46 degrees C. Unlike a three host-tick, larvae of D. albipictus have no preconditioning response to low or high temperature exposure by rapid cold hardening (RCH) or heat hardening, and poor ability to acclimate to low and high temperature extremes. Thermal tolerance limits were not improved as the result of larval clustering, and there was only a minimal effect due to changes in photoperiod. These larvae are freeze intolerant and die at higher temperatures (-5 to-10 degrees C) from contact with ice by inoculative freezing. In absence of cold-associated resistance mechanisms, winter survival requires that larvae procure a host before the first snow cover. Their low and high temperature tolerance, however, is a key survival element that adapts them for off-host periods during summer, which in the arctic could allow for northern expansion.																	1877-959X	1877-9603				JAN	2018	9	1					25	30		10.1016/j.ttbdis.2017.10.013								WOS:000416371100005	29103951

Temperature Influences on Diapause Induction and Survival in the Boll Weevil (Coleoptera: Curculionidae)	JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE												The boll weevil, Anthonomus grandis grandis Boheman (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), has been the most important pest of cotton (Gossypium spp.) wherever it occurs. Although eradication programs in the United States have reduced the range of this pest, the weevil remains an intractable problem in subtropical Texas, Mexico, and much of South America. A key to managing the weevil in the subtropics and tropics might lie in better understanding its diapause and overwintering survival in regions characterized by relatively high late-season temperatures. We examined the temporal patterns of acquisition of diapause characters at 18.3, 23.9, and 29.4 degrees C, and the effects of temperature during the diapause-induction period on subsequent host-free survival at 23.9 degrees C. Occurrence of the diapause characters generally increased with weevil age at all temperatures but appeared more rapidly at higher temperatures. Acquisition of the diapause characters tended to occur slightly earlier in female weevils compared with the male weevils. Despite the slower development of diapause characters at lower temperatures, when adult weevils were fed under low temperatures, subsequent host-free survival was enhanced. These results are consistent with reports of increased weevil survival with delayed entry into overwintering. Our findings also suggest that the potential host-free survival facilitated by diapause occurring in subtropical or tropical production regions may be reduced compared with dormancy developing in southern temperate regions. This reduced survival potential emphasizes the importance of a maximized host-free season and suggests that the late-season diapause spray intervals should be short enough to ensure that the number of dormant weevils developing in late-season cotton is minimized.																	1536-2442	2250-2645				DEC 23	2017	17	6							124	10.1093/jisesa/iex101								WOS:000418913200004

Heavy rainfall triggers increased nocturnal flight in desert populations of the Pacific black duck (Anas superciliosa)	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Understanding of avian nocturnal flight comes mainly from northern hemisphere species in seasonal temperate ecosystems where nocturnal flight is often precisely timed and entrained by annual photoperiod. Here we investigate patterns of nocturnal flight in waterbirds of Australian desert ecosystems that fly considerable distances to find temporary water bodies formed from rainfall which is highly unpredictable seasonally and spatially, and when there is sufficient water, they then breed. How they perform these feats of navigation and physiology remain poorly known. Using GPS tracking of 38 satellite tagged Pacific black ducks (Anas superciliosa) in two contrasting ecosystems, before and after heavy rainfall we revealed a key role for facultative nocturnal flight in the movement ecology of this species. After large rainfall events, birds rapidly increased nocturnal flight activity in the arid aseasonal ecosystem, but not in the mesic seasonal one. Nocturnal flights occurred throughout the night in both ecosystems. Long range flights (> 50 km in 2 hours) occurred almost exclusively at night; at night the distance flown was higher than during the day, birds visited more locations, and the locations were more widely dispersed. Our work reveals that heavy rainfall triggers increased nocturnal flight activity in desert populations of waterbirds.

J	Franch-Gras, L; Garcia-Roger, EM; Serra, M; Carmona, MJ				Franch-Gras, Lluis; Garcia-Roger, Eduardo M.; Serra, Manuel; Jose Carmona, Maria			Adaptation in response to environmental unpredictability	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Understanding how organisms adaptively respond to environmental fluctuations is a fundamental question in evolutionary biology. The Mediterranean region typically exhibits levels of environmental unpredictability that vary greatly in habitats over small geographical scales. In cyclically parthenogenetic rotifers, clonal proliferation occurs along with occasional bouts of sex. These bouts contribute to the production of diapausing eggs, which allows survival between growing seasons. Here, we studied two diapause-related traits in rotifers using clones from nine Brachionus plicatilis natural populations that vary in the degree of environmental unpredictability. We tested the hypothesis that the level of environmental unpredictability is directly related to the propensity for sex and inversely related to the hatching fraction of diapausing eggs. We found significant levels of genetic variation within populations for both traits. Interestingly, a positive correlation between pond unpredictability-quantified in a previous study from satellite imagery-and the propensity for sex was found. This correlation suggests a conservative, bet-hedging strategy that provides protection against unexpectedly short growing seasons. By contrast, the hatching fraction of diapausing eggs was not related to the level of environmental predictability. Our results highlight the ability of rotifer populations to locally adapt to time-varying environments, providing an evolutionarily relevant step forward in relating life-history traits to a quantitative measure of environmental unpredictability.

Genetic divergence of 26 populations, based on 710bp of the mtCOI sequence, showed two phylogenetic lineages, which could not be connected in the haplotype network with 95% confidence. The two lineages are separated by 3.1% sequence divergence and should be considered for full species status. The estimated split occurred 1.2-1.6million years ago. The range of the RD type covered most of the continent, whereas that of the BL type was limited to eastern deciduous forests. Several biological characteristics were differentiated in the zone of cohabitation where BL had more annual generations than RD. Spring emergence of BL precedes that of RD in the field by at least 1month, because the diapause in BL was shallow, whereas it was deep in RD. Voltinism requires discreteness of numbers, which functions as a sink of hybrids between the two parental lines that have distinct but equally adaptive reproductive strategies; BL may be more r-strategist-like and RD more K-strategist-like, because fast-developing BL has multivoltine life cycle, investing less silk proteins as the round-the-clock feeder, and slow-developing RD univoltine one investing more silk as the nocturnal feeder. Also, intensity of diapause, deep in RD and weak in BL, was grossly different, which may enforce segregation of spring adults. Allochronic speciation avoiding coincidental occurrence of adult stages is therefore the most likely scenario. Because the adults never meet in nature, large morphological differentiation is not required.																	2045-7758					DEC	2017	7	24					10592	10603		10.1002/ece3.3334								WOS:000418824800011	29299241

Robust experimental studies examining the role of these putative cues in triggering spawning have been lacking until recently because it has not been possible to predictably induce spawning in fully closed artificial mesocosms. Here, we present a closed system mesocosm aquarium design that utilizes microprocessor technology to accurately replicate environmental conditions, including photoperiod, seasonal insolation, lunar cycles, and seasonal temperature from Singapore and the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia. Coupled with appropriate coral husbandry, these mesocosms were successful in inducing, for the first time, broadcast coral spawning in a fully closed artificial ex situ environment. Four Acropora species (A.hyacinthus, A.tenuis, A.millepora, and A.microclados) from two geographical locations, kept for over 1year, completed full gametogenic cycles ex situ. The percentage of colonies developing oocytes varied from similar to 29% for A.hyacinthus to 100% for A.millepora and A.microclados. Within the Singapore mesocosm, A.hyacinthus exhibited the closest synchronization to wild spawning, with all four gravid colonies releasing gametes in the same lunar month as wild predicted dates. Spawning within the GBR mesocosm commenced at the predicted wild spawn date but extended over a period of 3months. Gamete release in relation to the time postsunset for A.hyacinthus, A.millepora, and A.tenuis was consistent with time windows previously described in the wild. Spawn date in relation to full moon, however, was delayed in all species, possibly as a result of external light pollution. The system described here could broaden the number of institutions on a global scale, that can access material for broadcast coral spawning research, providing opportunities for institutions distant from coral reefs to produce large numbers of coral larvae and juveniles for research purposes and reef restoration efforts.

BODY TEMPERATURES AND WINTER ACTIVITY IN OVERWINTERING TIMBER RATTLESNAKES (CROTALUS HORRIDUS) IN TENNESSEE, USA	HERPETOLOGICAL CONSERVATION AND BIOLOGY												At high latitudes and elevations, snakes spend considerable time in overwintering refugia. Although brumation is generally associated with periods of inactivity, some evidence supports the occurrence of limited above and below ground activity during winter. Observations of such events are rare due to the inaccessibility of the typical subterranean refugia of snakes. Our study examined occurrences of both surface and subterranean activity during winter in the Timber Rattlesnake, Crotalus horridus. We monitored hourly body temperatures (T(b)s) and small-scale above and below ground movement bouts throughout the overwintering period in Tennessee, USA. High frequency monitoring of body temperatures and movement patterns allowed us to identify mid-winter activity as well as shuttling behavior during ingress and egress. We recorded environmental temperatures and snake operative temperatures to estimate periods when snakes were surface active. Snake ingress into brumation occurred on 10 October +/- 12 d, and egress occurred on 7 April +/- 17 d. We recorded 53,041 T(b)s (mean snake T-b = 11.0 +/- 3.6 degrees C; range 1.1-33.7 degrees C) collected over two overwintering periods (2011-2012 and 2012-2013). Snakes made on average 6.1 +/- 1.2 movement bouts throughout winter, accumulating a total distance of 146.4 +/- 35.5 m. All individuals made small (< 10 m) movements throughout winter. We speculate that milder winters and the increased prevalence of suitable surface temperatures will promote additional winter activity.																	2151-0733	1931-7603				DEC	2017	12	3					606	615										WOS:000418700500004

Calcifying epiphytic organisms living in this environment are therefore exposed to a different pH environment than that of the water column. To evaluate the actual pH environment on blade surfaces, we measured the thickness of the DBL and pH gradients within it for six subarctic macrophytes: Fucus vesiculosus, Ascophyllum nodosum, Ulva lactuca, Zostera marina, Saccharina longicruris, and Agarum clathratum. We measured pH under laboratory conditions at ambient temperatures (2-3 A degrees C) and slow, stable flow over the blade surface at five light intensities (dark, 30, 50, 100 and 200 A mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)). Boundary layer thickness ranged between 511 and 1632 A mu m, while the maximum difference in pH (a dagger pH) between the blade surface and the water column ranged between 0.4 +/- 0.14 (average +/- SE; Zostera) and 1.2 +/- 0.13 (average +/- SE; Ulva) pH units. These differences in pH are larger than predictions for pH changes in the bulk water by the end of the century. A simple quadratic model best described the relationship between light intensity and maximum a dagger pH, pointing at relatively low optimum PAR of between 28 and 139 A mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1) to reach maximum a dagger pH. Elevated pH at the blade surface may provide chemical "refugia" for calcifying epiphytic organisms, especially during summer at higher latitudes where photoperiods are long.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				DEC	2017	40	12					2343	2348		10.1007/s00300-017-2143-y								WOS:000418386500001

The level of cold hardiness acquired during the dormant season by Vitis sp. is crucial for winter survival. Most research published on this topic has been generated beyond 40 degrees N latitude, where daily mean temperatures may attain injurious levels during the dormant season resulting in significant damage to vines and buds. Symptoms of cold injury have been identified in Mendoza (32-35 degrees S latitude), a Southern Hemisphere wine region characterized by a high thermal amplitude, and warm winds during the dormant season. These symptoms have usually been attributed to drought and/or pathogens, but not to rapid deacclimation followed by injurious low temperatures. Because local information on meteorological events as probable causes is scarce, this research was designed to test and study this assumption by comparing macro-, meso-, and microclimatic data from Mendoza, Argentina, and eastern Washington, USA. The goal was to unveil why freezing damage has occurred in both regions, despite the existence of large climatic differences. Because environmental parameters under field conditions may not correspond to data recorded by conventional weather stations, sensors were installed in vineyards for comparison. Microclimatic conditions on grapevines were also evaluated to assess the most vulnerable portions of field-grown grapevines. In order to better understand if it may be possible to modify cold hardiness status in a short period with high thermal amplitude conditions, deacclimation was induced using a thermal treatment. Hence, despite the fact that Mendoza is warmer, and temperatures are not as extreme as in Washington, high daily thermal amplitude might be partially involved in plant deacclimation, leading to a differential cold hardiness response.

Humidity does not appear to trigger leaf out in woody plants	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY												In order to anticipate the ecological impacts of climate change and model changes to forests, it is important to understand the factors controlling spring leaf out. Leaf out phenology in woody trees and shrubs is generally considered to be strongly controlled by a combination of spring warming, winter chilling requirement, and photoperiod. However, researchers have recently suggested that temperature-related air humidity, rather than temperature itself, might be the main trigger of the spring leaf-out of woody plants. Here, we sought to examine the relationship between air humidity and leaf-out across a range of humidities and plant functional groups. We did not find any consistent, measurable effect of high humidity advancing leaf-out in the 15 woody shrubs and trees examined in this study, and we did not see progressive patterns of earlier leaf-out in successively higher humidities. Our results indicate that more work must be done on this topic before researchers can properly determine the effect of humidity on the leafing out process for woody species.																	0020-7128	1432-1254				DEC	2017	61	12					2213	2216		10.1007/s00484-017-1428-8								WOS:000418453200018	28828598

C. maculata were fed eggs of Ephestia kuehniella Zeller, as were larval H. convergens, whereas adult H. convergens were fed Melanaphis sacchari (Zehntner) to induce egg maturation; adults of both species received water and diluted honey. A spot of magnetic paint was applied to one elytrum of each beetle, which then adhered to a small neodymium magnet attached to a thread. Beetles were permitted 1 h flight opportunities daily for 3-d periods, first as virgins on their fifth day of adult life, secondly after mating, thirdly after females began oviposition, and fourthly after prey were withheld and egg maturation and oviposition ceased. Both species exhibited low flight activity as virgins, and whereas C. maculata females increased their activity after mating, H. convergens females did not. Flight activity in C. maculata did not change with onset of oviposition, whereas it increased in H. convergens males, but not females. In contrast, H. convergens females increased their flight activity after cessation of oviposition, whereas C. maculata females did not. Female flight activity when either virgin or mated correlated weakly with fecundity in C. maculata, but not in H. convergens. Species differences are discussed in the context of nutritional ecology; H. convergens usually enters diapause immediately following emergence, and is more dependent on aphids for reproduction, whereas C. maculata develops and reproduces on a wider range of foods and is not so constrained.																	0046-225X	1938-2936				DEC	2017	46	6					1359	1364		10.1093/ee/nvx136								WOS:000417734400022	28961806

The species is of great public health concern as it can transmit at least 26 arboviruses, including dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses. In this study, using double-digest Restriction site-Associated DNA (ddRAD) sequencing, we developed a panel of similar to 58,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) based on 20 worldwide Ae.albopictus populations representing both the invasive and the native range. We used this genomic-based approach to study the genetic structure and the differentiation of Ae.albopictus populations and to understand origin(s) and dynamics of the recent invasions. Our analyses indicated the existence of two major genetically differentiated population clusters, each one including both native and invasive populations. The detection of additional genetic structure within each major cluster supports that these SNPs can detect differentiation at a global and local scale, while the similar levels of genomic diversity between native and invasive range populations support the scenario of multiple invasions or colonization by a large number of propagules. Finally, our results revealed the possible source(s) of the recent invasion in Americas, Europe, and Africa, a finding with important implications for vector-control strategies.																	2045-7758					DEC	2017	7	23					10143	10157		10.1002/ece3.3514								WOS:000417754100025

The most challenging problem when developing a life-cycle test is that the egg development time varies greatly and is sometimes too long (> 150 d) to monitor. It is desirable to shorten the duration of life-cycle toxicity tests including the observation period of egg development while preserving the ecological relevance of the net reproductive rate (R-0), an endpoint in the life-cycle test. Therefore, in the present study, we suggest a practical test duration for R-0 using population growth rate () as a measure of ecological relevance. We collected a range of life history characteristics of the ostracod by combining data from the literature and experimental results, constructed population matrix models, and calculated for 20 life history patterns. The results showed that a longer test period (> 150 d) did not increase the correlation coefficients between R-0 and . Rather, a shorter test duration resulted in R-0 being highly correlated with . Our results suggest that a life-cycle toxicity test using the ostracod can provide an ecologically relevant toxicity endpoint, even if the test is abandoned after approximately 50 d and unhatched eggs remain.

However, there are a limited number of studies addressing this issue in exotic insects. The rice water weevil Lissorhoptrus oryzophilus Kuschel (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), which is native to North America, is one of the most invasive insect pests in east Asia. In this study, we investigated the reproductive status of first-generation females (progeny of overwintered weevils) from five geographic regions in southern and northern China in the field, and reproductive status and ovipositional features of females provided with suitable host plants in the laboratory after collection. Under field conditions, a proportion of females oviposited, while the rest remained in diapause from all three southern regions investigated, but reproductive development did not take place in females from the two northern regions, where the weevil produces only one generation per year. However, when fed host plants in the laboratory, females from all regions laid eggs. They typically had a very short ovipositional period (3-6 d on average on rice at a temperature of 27 degrees C), laid a low number of eggs, and did not die soon after oviposition; this was different from common reproductive females. We concluded that first-generation L. oryzophilus females, which largely enter diapause after emergence, are highly plastic in their reproductive performance and are ready to reproduce under favorable conditions. Our results indicate the significance of their reproductive plasticity for geographic spread and population development.																	0022-0493	1938-291X				DEC	2017	110	6					2381	2387		10.1093/jee/tox274								WOS:000417754400014	29045676					
J	Bogan, MT				Bogan, Michael T.			Hurry up and wait: life cycle and distribution of an intermittent stream specialist (Mesocapnia arizonensis)	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Species inhabiting intermittent streams must have life-history traits that confer resistance or resilience to flow cessation or drying. However, we lack basic life-history information for most aquatic invertebrate species, especially those from intermittent streams. I documented the life cycle and distribution of an unusual winter stonefly species, Mesocapnia arizonensis (Capniidae). The species was first described from 6 localities in 1969, but its natural history remained enigmatic. I surveyed >90 streams across the southwestern USA, documented the life cycle of M. arizonensis at 1 locality, and experimentally rehydrated dry streambed sediment in search of dormant stoneflies at another locality. Field surveys expanded the number of localities from 22 to 98, most of which were intermittent with flow durations as brief as 3 mo/y, and extended the known range of the species by 800 km. Nymphs were abundant within days of flow resumption, grew rapidly as a single cohort, and started emerging as adults 42 d after flow resumed. The brief appearance of a 2(nd) cohort of tiny nymphs 1 mo before the stream dried indicates direct hatching of at least some eggs. I failed to find dormant stoneflies in the top 30 cm of dry stream sediment, suggesting that M. arizonensis undergoes dormancy deep in the substrate, putting it safely out of reach of scouring summer floods that occur between favorable winter seasons. The remarkable ability of M. arizonensis to survive in short-flow duration streams and to endure multiple consecutive dry years, suggests that the species is well prepared for the drier climatic conditions predicted to occur across its range.																	2161-9549	2161-9565				DEC	2017	36	4					805	815		10.1086/694746								WOS:000416259800011

Cell dimensions, thylakoid arrangement and apical cell shape are consistent with the Pseudanabaena genus description. The molecular characterisation of P. catenata gave 100% similarity with Pseudanabaena catenata SAG 1464-1, originally reported from Germany. Strain USMAC16 was cultured under a range of temperature and photoperiod conditions, in solid and liquid media, and harvested at exponential phase to examine its phenotypic plasticity. Under different culture conditions, we observed considerable variations in cell dimensions. The longest cell (5.91 +/- 0.13 mu m) was observed at 15 degrees C under 12:12 light: dark, and the widest cell (3.24 +/- 0.06 mu m) at 4 degrees C under 12:12 light: dark in liquid media.

We estimated genetic values of isofemale lines established from dormant eggs of D. galeata collected from field sampling sites with the toxicant threshold model applied using acute toxicity. We compared genetic values and variances and broad-sense heritability across different sites in the lake. Results showed that the mean tolerance values to fenitrothion did not differ spatially. The variance in genetic value and heritability of fenitrothion tolerance significantly differed between sampling sites, revealing that long-term ecological risk of fenitrothion may differ between local populations in the lake. These results have implications for aquatic toxicology research, suggesting that differences in genetic variation of tolerance to a chemical among local populations must be considered for understanding the long-term ecological risks of the chemical over a large geographic area.																	0963-9292	1573-3017				DEC	2017	26	10					1358	1365		10.1007/s10646-017-1860-x								WOS:000416329500007

A common thermal niche among geographically diverse populations of the widely distributed tree species Eucalyptus tereticornis: No evidence for adaptation to climate-of-origin	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Impacts of climate warming depend on the degree to which plants are constrained by adaptation to their climate-of-origin or exhibit broad climatic suitability. We grew cool-origin, central and warm-origin provenances of Eucalyptus tereticornis in an array of common temperature environments from 18 to 35.5 degrees C to determine if this widely distributed tree species consists of geographically contrasting provenances with differentiated and narrow thermal niches, or if provenances share a common thermal niche. The temperature responses of photosynthesis, respiration, and growth were equivalent across the three provenances, reflecting a common thermal niche despite a 2,200 km geographic distance and 13 degrees C difference in mean annual temperature at seed origin. The temperature dependence of growth was primarily mediated by changes in leaf area per unit plant mass, photosynthesis, and whole-plant respiration. Thermal acclimation of leaf, stem, and root respiration moderated the increase in respiration with temperature, but acclimation was constrained at high temperatures. We conclude that this species consists of provenances that are not differentiated in their thermal responses, thus rejecting our hypothesis of adaptation to climate-of-origin and suggesting a shared thermal niche. In addition, growth declines with warming above the temperature optima were driven by reductions in whole-plant leaf area and increased respiratory carbon losses. The impacts of climate warming will nonetheless vary across the geographic range of this and other such species, depending primarily on each provenance's climate position on the temperature response curves for photosynthesis, respiration, and growth.

Ephippia represent the dormant community in sediments and allow tracing population dynamics and community succession with environmental change in water bodies in time. As reservoirs are created by damming rivers, the species composition and structure of a dormant cladoceran community are expected to depend on trophic state as well as on hydrological conditions. We collected ephippia from sediments in the transition and lacustrine zones of Liuxihe reservoir, a warm-water impoundment in southern China. High species richness with low abundance was found in the transitional zone, while high abundance was found at the lacustrine zone. Ephippia identified Daphnia galeata as the first Cladocera colonizer of the newly created water body, but littoral or small sized species-Scapholeberis sp. and Bosmina sp. fast increased and became dominated from damming till the end of 1970s. Medium-sized pelagic species-Moina micrura and D. galeata-increased from 1975 onwards, corresponding to an increase in diatom abundance with slight eutrophication and hydrological shift due to the construction of two small dams in the upstream zone of the feeding rivers. A two-way stepwise linear regression analysis showed that spatial variables explained 33% of ephippial total abundance while diatom abundance explained 5.2%. Hydrological conditions in the dry season (October to next March) were unrelated to total ephippial abundance but explained 37.5% in the wet season (April to September). We conclude the distinct longitudinal gradient and vertical variation of the dormant community provide useful information for understanding of long-term dynamics of site-specific hydrological processes, primary productivity and hydrologic events.																	0921-2728	1573-0417				DEC	2017	58	4					571	584		10.1007/s10933-017-9993-8								WOS:000414421600009

In Japan, female adults begin to bite in between April and June, except in the southern subtropics where the mosquito has no dormant period. It is difficult to estimate the first Ae. albopictus biting day because it varies annually depending on the location. Over several years, we surveyed the mosquitoes at different locations that covered a range of warmer to cooler areas of Japan. We found an association between the timing of first biting day by Ae. albopictus and spring temperature. In spring months, the strongest correlation was found with mean April temperatures, followed by March. Based on these data, it may, therefore, be possible to apply a simple formula to predict the timing of the first biting day at various geographical locations in Japan. Forecasting maps were created using a simple prediction formula. We found that the first biting day for Ae. albopictus changed depending on early spring temperatures for each year. There was an approximate 20-d difference in first biting day between years with warmer and cooler springs. This prediction model will provide useful insight for planning and practice of Ae. albopictus control programs, targeting larvae and adults, in temperate regions globally.

It is univoltine, but some individuals exhibit prolonged diapause. In this study, we documented diapause termination rate of cocooned larvae at different diapausing periods and time required for adult emergence when they were brought to 25 degrees C from the field in northern China. We found that field larvae all entered diapause by June, but none terminated diapause until late September when the daily average temperature dropped to below 20 degrees C. Furthermore, termination rate increased significantly as diapausing larvae underwent increasing chilling duration, reaching > 95% from early December to early March. Our results suggest that chilling was necessary for diapause to terminate and that field diapause termination ended in early December. To explore low temperature and duration required, we cold-treated field diapausing larvae of different periods at different low temperatures for various lengths of time prior to the 25 degrees C incubation. Chilling at 4-8 degrees C for 60-90 days resulted in a higher termination rate ( > 90%) and shorter adult emergence time in general. Additionally, we investigated the combined effect of temperature (18-30 degrees C) and soil moisture (20-60%, on dry weight basis) as well as the effect of photoperiod (24:0-0:24 L:D) on post-diapause development. While photoperiod did not affect adult emergence, soil moisture ranging from 30 to 50% and temperature from 22 to 26 degrees C resulted in the highest adult emergence rates ( > 46%) within relatively short time ( < 18 days). Mortality and/or prolonged diapause rate drastically increased when incubation conditions were outside the optimal range, especially at 30 degrees C. These findings provide new insight into the diapause process of S. mosellana, and information will be useful for development of field forecasting and laboratory rearing techniques of this pest insect.																	0022-1910	1879-1611				NOV-DEC	2017	103						78	85		10.1016/j.jinsphys.2017.10.001								WOS:000417963700010	28987773

Day-night temperature differential, rather than mean temperature, determines age of sexual maturation in Straicosta albicosta (Noctuidae)	JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY												While pheromone traps have been effectively used to monitor the recent range expansion of the western bean cutworm (WBC), very little is known about the pheromone mediated reproductive biology of this species. The age at which females initiated calling (the behaviour associated with the release of the sex pheromone), and the pattern of calling on the first three nights following sexual maturation were determined for virgin females held under four temperature regimes (25:20; 25:15; 20:15; 20:10 degrees C L:D and 16L:8D photoperiod), and two RH (60 and 80%). Regardless of the rearing conditions the pre-calling period (PCP) was always several days post emergence, supporting the hypothesis that WCB is a migrant species. However, surprisingly the length of the PCP was not directly related to mean temperature but rather to the temperature differential between the photophase and the scotophase. The duration of calling increased with female age, but unlike in other moths was not affected by the abiotic factors tested. The relative insensitivity to temperature and humidity, when compared with many other moth species, may be related to the WBC being a univoltine species with a mid-summer flight period. Consequently, there would not be strong selection pressure for plasticity in calling behavior when compared with the case of multivoltine species that experience a wide range of environmental conditions during different seasonal flight periods.																	0022-1910	1879-1611				NOV-DEC	2017	103						86	90		10.1016/j.jinsphys.2017.10.010								WOS:000417963700011	29061313

Defining the Degree of Seasonality and its Significance for Future Research	INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY												Seasonality describes cyclic and largely predictable fluctuations in the environment. Such variations in day length, temperature, rainfall, and resource availability are ubiquitous and can exert strong selection pressure on organisms to adapt to seasonal environments. However, seasonal variations exhibit large scale geographical divergences caused by a whole suite of factors such as solar radiation, ocean currents, extent of continents, and topography. Realizing these contributions in driving patterns of overall seasonality may help advance our understanding of the kinds of evolutionary adaptations we should expect at a global scale. Here, we introduce a new concept and provide the data describing the overall degree of seasonality, based on its two major components-amplitude and predictability. Using global terrestrial datasets on temperature, precipitation and primary productivity, we show that these important seasonal factors exhibit strong differences in their spatial patterns with notable asymmetries between the southern and the northern hemisphere. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that seasonality is highly diverse across latitudes as well as longitudinal gradients. This indicates that using a direct measure of seasonality and its components, amplitude and predictability, may yield a better understanding of how organisms are adapted to seasonal environments and provide support for predictions on the consequences of rapid environmental change.																	1540-7063	1557-7023				NOV	2017	57	5					934	942		10.1093/icb/icx040								WOS:000416721300002	28662570					
J	Varpe, O				Varpe, Oystein			Life History Adaptations to Seasonality	INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY												Seasonality creates a template for many natural processes and evolutionary adaptations. Organisms are often faced with an annual cycle consisting of a productive (favorable) and unproductive period. This yearly cycle along with other seasonal variations in abiotic factors and associated biotic interactions form strong selection pressures shaping the scheduling of annual activities and the developmental stages and modes of life through the year. Annual decisions impact trade-offs that involve both current and future reproductive value (RV), and life history theory provides the foundation to understand these linkages between phenology and an organism's full life. Annual routine models further allow for multiple annual decisions to be optimized and predicted with respect to lifetime consequences. Studies of life history adaptations to seasonality are concerned with questions such as: within the productive season, should growth come first, followed by reproduction, or the other way around? What is the best time to diapause or migrate, and how will this timing impact other life history traits? Should energy reserves be built, to transfer resources from 1 year to the next, and allow for the spatial and temporal freedom of capital breeding? If offspring value is low during parts of the productive season, what is then the best alternative to reproduction: accumulate stores, grow, or wait in safety? To help answer these and other questions, I provide an overview of key theoretical concepts and some of the main life schedules, annual routines, and trade-offs involved. Adaptations to the unproductive period include diapause (dormancy), embryonic resting stages (eggs, seeds), energy reserves, and seasonal migrations. Adaptations to the productive window include rapid growth, high reproductive effort, capital breeding, and reproduction entrained to the annual cycle and with precise timing. Distinct annual routines, large body size, energy storage capacities, and parental care are also adaptations to seasonality. Phenotypic plasticity and state-dependence are important parts of these traits and are adaptations in their own. I give particular attention to timing of breeding and the associated birth-time dependent contributions to fitness. Seasonality in offspring value impacts the scheduling of growth, storage, and reproduction and may create parent-offspring conflicts over breeding timing. A combined offspring and parent value perspective should be adopted more broadly, also because of the management implications. I further argue for strategic but careful use of latitudinal (and altitudinal) gradients, and more attention to the role of seasonally varying predation risk as a selective force.

We investigated protein expression in five stream stonefly species from four geographic regions along a latitudinal gradient in Japan with varying climatic conditions. The extracted proteins were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization of time-of-flight (MALDI TOF/TOF), yielding 446 proteins. Low interspecies variation in the proteome profiles was observed among five species within geographical regions, presumably due to the co-occurring species sharing the environments. However, large spatial variations in protein expression were found among four geographic regions, suggesting strong regulation of protein expression in heterogeneous environments, where the spatial variations were positively correlated with water temperature. We identified 21 unique proteins expressed specifically in a geographical region and six common proteins expressed throughout all regions. In warmer regions, metabolic proteins were upregulated, whereas proteins related to cold stress, the photoperiod, and mating were downregulated.

The open reading frames (ORFs) of six sHsps are 453, 489, 537, 543, 567 and 630 bp in length, encoding proteins with molecular weights of 17.7, 18.4, 20.4, 20.6, 21.6 and 23.8 kDa, respectively. BdHsp18.4 and BdHsp20.4 maintained lower expression levels in both eggs and larvae, whereas remarkably up-regulated after the larval-pupal transformation, suggesting that these two sHsps may be involved in metamorphosis. Significant tissue specificity exists among sHsps: the highest expression of BdHsp20. 6 and BdHsp23.8 in the Malpighian tubules and ovary, respectively, versus a peak in the fat body for others. BdHsp20.4 and BdHsp20. 6 were significantly up-regulated by thermal stress. In contrast, Bdifsp18.4 and BdHsp23.8 reacted only to heat stress. BdHsp17.7 and BdHsp21.6 were insensitive to both heat and cold stresses. The degree of sHsps response depends on intensity of 20E treatment, i.e., dose and time. These results strongly suggest functional differentiation within the sHsp subfamily in B. dorsalis. The physiological function of sHsp members under thermal stress and normal growth remains the subjects of further investigation.																	1096-4959	1879-1107				NOV	2017	213						8	16		10.1016/j.cbpb.2017.07.005								WOS:000412258300002	28735974

Phenological responses of Icelandic subarctic grasslands to short-term and long-term natural soil warming	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												The phenology of vegetation, particularly the length of the growing season (LOS; i.e., the period from greenup to senescence), is highly sensitive to climate change, which could imply potent feedbacks to the climate system, for example, by altering the ecosystem carbon (C) balance. In recent decades, the largest extensions of LOS have been reported at high northern latitudes, but further warming-induced LOS extensions may be constrained by too short photoperiod or unfulfilled chilling requirements. Here, we studied subarctic grasslands, which cover a vast area and contain large C stocks, but for which LOS changes under further warming are highly uncertain. We measured LOS extensions of Icelandic subarctic grasslands along natural geothermal soil warming gradients of different age (short term, where the measurements started after 5 years of warming and long term, i.e., warmed since 50 years) using ground-level measurements of normalized difference vegetation index. We found that LOS linearly extended with on average 2.1 days per degrees C soil warming up to the highest soil warming levels (ca. +10 degrees C) and that LOS had the potential to extend at least 1 month. This indicates that the warming impact on LOS in these subarctic grasslands will likely not saturate in the near future. A similar response to short- and long-term warming indicated a strong physiological control of the phenological response of the subarctic grasslands to warming and suggested that genetic adaptations and community changes were likely of minor importance. We conclude that the warming-driven extension of the LOSs of these subarctic grasslands did not saturate up to +10 degrees C warming, and hence that growing seasons of high-latitude grasslands are likely to continue lengthening with future warming (unless genetic adaptations or species shifts do occur). This persistence of the warming-induced extension of LOS has important implications for the C-sink potential of subarctic grasslands under climate change.

J	Thomas, PA				Thomas, Peter A.			Biological Flora of the British Isles: Sorbus torminalis	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1. This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Sorbus torminalis (L.) Crantz (Wild Service-tree) that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history and conservation. 2. Sorbus torminalis is an uncommon, mostly small tree (but can reach 33 m) native to lowland England and Wales, and temperate and Mediterranean regions of mainland Europe. It is the most shade-tolerant member of the genus in the British Isles, and as a result, it is more closely associated with woodland than any other British species. Like other British Sorbus species, however, it grows best where competition for space and sunlight is limited. Seedlings are shade tolerant but adults are only moderately so. This, combined with its low competitive ability, restricts the best growth to open areas. In shade, saplings and young adults form a sapling bank, showing reproduction and extensive growth only when released. Sorbus torminalis tolerates a wide range of soil reaction (pH 3.5-8.0) but grows best on calcareous clays and thin soils over limestone. 3. Sorbus torminalis is a sexual, diploid, non-apomictic species that has hybridised with a number of other Sorbus species to form microspecies. The hermaphrodite flowers are primarily insect pollinated. Seed production is reliable only in warm years, especially at the edge of its range, although even then seed viability is low. The fruits are primarily dispersed by carnivorous mammals. Seeds display embryo dormancy but most will germinate the first spring after falling. 4. This tree is very tolerant of short droughts but only moderately tolerant of frost, hence its southerly and lowland distribution. It faces no particular individual threats although the small size of most populations makes it susceptible to habitat loss and fragmentation, particularly through the loss of open coppiced areas. As a consequence, it appears to be declining throughout Britain and Europe despite its wide range of historical uses and the high value of its timber. The extent to which these losses will be offset by increases due to climate change is unknown.																	0022-0477	1365-2745				NOV	2017	105	6			SI		1806	1831		10.1111/1365-2745.12857								WOS:000413341700031

Here, we studied circannual synchronization in an arctic species, the reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus), which ceases to produce a rhythmic melatonin signal when it is exposed to extended periods of continuous midwinter darkness and continuous midsummer light. Using food intake, antler growth and moult as endpoints, we demonstrate that when animals living at 70 degrees N are transferred from natural photoperiods in late autumn to either continuous light or continuous darkness, they undergo a conspicuous acceleration of the circannual programme. We conclude that rhythmical melatonin secretion, recommencing when the Sun reappears late in January, is required for proper timing of spring physiological responses, through a delaying effect on the circannual programme set in motion during the preceding autumn.																	0022-0949	1477-9145				NOV 1	2017	220	21					3869	3872		10.1242/jeb.163741								WOS:000414145900011	28864562

Latent TB infection is especially difficult to treat due to the phenotypic antibiotic resistance of non-replicating M. tuberculosis. Therefore, the development of new drugs effective against both active and latent TB infection is needed. New 1-hydroxy-2-thiopyridine derivatives were synthesized and found to be highly effective in vitro against both actively growing and dormant non-culturable M. tuberculosis. Such compounds are leads for the development of new drugs for all forms of TB including latent infection.

Grazing Intensity and Phenotypic Plasticity in the Clonal Grass Leymus chinensis	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT												Phenotypic plasticity enables plants to cope with changes in their environment. Plasticity in a population of Leymus chinensis, a common grass species in arid and semiarid temperate grasslands of northern China, was determined in a natural grassland grazed by large domestic herbivores. We measured shoot and bud characteristics monthly along a grazing intensity gradient indicated by distance from the village gate during two growing seasons. In addition, some plants along the gradient were removed to a common transplant garden and their growth was compared. Leaf characteristics (leaf angle, leaf length, and leaf number), growth form (tiller height and tiller clusters), bud proliferation, and plant fitness differed significantly in situ along the gradient. The expression of plasticity was grazing intensity dependent: the greatest increase in tiller density, tiller cluster, and bud number occurred at a moderate grazing intensity (2.5 km from the village gate). In the transplant garden, no evidence was found for distinct populations of L. chinensis within the grassland. Leaf characteristics, tiller growth form, and bud demography of tillers not grazed showed phenotypic plasticity in response to grazing of neighbor shoots because clonal reproduction is the main breeding system for this species in grazed natural grassland and defoliation of neighbor shoots is likely to affect the physiology and morphology of tillers that are not grazed. The observed overcompensation in vegetative reproduction may aid future survival and growth and could be achieved in a prudent grazing system designed to take into account the needs of this dominant grass in semiarid temperate steppes.

Four release sites, including one in the Central Valley and three along the Monterey Bay, were monitored from 1999 to 2015. Lygus spp. and P. relictus populations were monitored in alfalfa, weedy non-crop vegetation, and commercial strawberries. An experimental field cage study was also conducted to measure the contribution of both P. relictus and resident predators to Lygus spp. mortality. Results from both caging and longitudinal studies demonstrated that P. relictus had a negative impact on Lygus spp. nymphal densities. Annual percent parasitism peaks ranged from 45 to 71% in alfalfa or non-crop vegetation, which were either correlated with host densities or demonstrated a delayed density dependent response. Lygus spp. population reductions of over 90% were recorded at five of six sampling locations by 2011-2012. An increase in Lygus spp. densities was observed at two release sites during the last two years of monitoring in the Monterey Bay region and may be related to climate. In-season nymphal densities were correlated with winter temperatures, as warmer than average winters may have affected diapause and accelerated population growth rates. We consider this study, which corroborates the preference by P. relictus for congeneric North American host species, the biological control value of this parasitoid's establishment, and climate as a possible contributor to Lygus spp. population dynamics, to be a valuable contribution to understanding biological control of Lygus spp. by P. relictus.																	1049-9644	1090-2112				NOV	2017	114						30	38		10.1016/j.biocontrol.2017.07.002								WOS:000411473000005

Teleogryllus emma (Ohmachi and Matsumura) and T. occipitalis (Serville) are widely distributed in east Asia, but their distribution and life history have not been reported from China. We studied the seasonal and geographical adaptation by rearing these crickets and measuring specimens. The main results are as follows: T. emma belongs to short-day type, which means nymphs grow rapidly in short day conditions (LD 12: 12); T. occipitalis belongs to long-day type, which means nymphs grow rapidly in long day conditions (LD 16: 8). The nymphal growth rate accelerates with the increase of temperature by comparing their nymph developmental period at 25 and 30 degrees C. T. emma is mainly distributed in the north of the Yangtze River, while T. occipitalis in the south of it. The body size decreases with the increase of latitude in both species, while the relative length of their ovipositor increases.																	1175-5326	1175-5334				OCT 25	2017	4338	2					374	384		10.11646/zootaxa.4338.2.11								WOS:000413507200011	29245748					
J	Dalziell, EL; Tomlinson, S				Dalziell, Emma L.; Tomlinson, Sean			Reduced metabolic rate indicates declining viability in seed collections: an experimental proof-of-concept	CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY												There is increasing investment globally in seed storage facilities for a wide array of purposes, from food security to biodiversity conservation. Best practice when storing seeds in this manner is to periodically test collections for viability, such that declining viability can be used as a trigger for management actions. Typically, viability testing is time consuming and/or destructive, involving germination testing, cut-testing or a range of potential biochemical indicators. Given that respiration (i.e. metabolic activity) is the basic chemical reaction common to all forms of life, measuring metabolic rate should provide a less-destructive, simple and repeatable correlate of seed viability. We compared the viability of seed collections of known proportions of alive and dead seeds to their metabolic rates, calculated as CO2 production (VCO2) measured using flow through respirometery. To maximize the activity of the seeds and our likelihood of measuring metabolic rates, we imbibed the seeds from 12 species of angiosperms, and measured them using an open system respirometer. Measuring metabolic rate in seeds from diverse evolutionary and ecological backgrounds required us to adopt an allometric approach to account for the effects of seed size upon metabolic rate. After doing so, however, we found significant linear relationships between the known viability of our seed collections and their metabolic rates, but these relationships were unique for each species measured. These data provide substantial support to the prospect that measuring metabolic rates can be used to estimate viability of seeds in storage, however, we advocate the development and adoption of more sensitive respirometry equipment, specifically engineered for this purpose in order to achieve truly non-destructive measurements.																	2051-1434					OCT 17	2017	5								cox058	10.1093/conphys/cox058								WOS:000413660300001						
J	Point, S; Lambrozo, J				Point, S.; Lambrozo, J.			Some evidences that white LEDs are toxic for human at domestic radiance?	RADIOPROTECTION												Artificial lighting has been a fundamental part of social and economic development of mankind. It allows to free human activity from natural variations and conditions (weather, day/night cycle, variation of day length depending on season and latitude...). The face of this artificial lighting has changed in the last years with the emergence of white phosphor coated LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) which offer many advantages in terms of reliability, efficiency and implementation. However, it is subject to special attention because their spectrum is typically rich in blue. Damages following exposure to high radiance blue light are well documented but some recent concerns have appeared regarding potential damages linked to white LEDs exposure at domestic radiance. Are these concerns justified? This article analyses some results of a recent study of animal retina exposure to light produced by LED technology and demonstrates that even if they are of interest in improving our understanding of the mechanisms of photochemical injury, they cannot be extrapolated to human without extreme caution and do not call into question the normative limits which are now the consensus.																	0033-8451	1769-700X				OCT-DEC	2017	52	4					297	299		10.1051/radiopro/2017026								WOS:000417997600012

The main purpose of this study is to examine climate change-related long-term (1961-2015) changes in the duration of both initial (pre-winter) and main (post-winter) winter wheat vegetation seasons and to present the projection of future phenological changes until the end of this century. Delay and shortening of pre-winter vegetation period, as well as the advancement and slight extension of the post-winter vegetation period, resulted in the reduction of whole winter wheat vegetation period by more than 1 week over the investigated 55 years. Projected changes in the timing of phenological phases which define limits of a main vegetation period differ essentially from the observed period. According to pessimistic (Representative Concentration Pathways 8.5) scenario, the advancement of winter wheat maturity phase by almost 30 days and the shortening of post-winter vegetation season by 15 days are foreseen for a far (2071-2100) projection. An increase in the available chilling amount is specific not only to the investigated historical period (1960-2015) but also to the projected period according to the climate change scenarios of climate warming for all three projection periods. Consequently, the projected climate warming does not pose a threat of plant vernalization shortage in the investigated geographical latitudes.																	0020-7128	1432-1254				OCT	2017	61	10					1765	1775		10.1007/s00484-017-1360-y								WOS:000413145100005	28484838					
J	Kosumi, T; Takeda, M				Kosumi, Takuya; Takeda, Makio			Three-year lifecycle, large body, and very high threshold temperature in the cricket Gryllus argenteus for special adaptation to desiccation cycle in Malawi	SCIENCE OF NATURE												In temperate climates, the initiation and termination of diapause synchronize the stress-tolerant stage with the stressful season and reproduction with the non-stressful season in many insects. Synchronization is often regulated by photoperiodism. Voltinism and the ultimate size of adults are also important determinants for their lifecycle, and different diapause stages and voltinism patterns are known in crickets. Here, we investigated the life history of the African cricket Gryllus argenteus from Malawi, which is a typical arid tropical highland. The climate is characterized by alternating arid and wet seasons, each of which lasts for half a year, and where the available heat mass is much less than lowlands at the same latitude. We first measured the nymphal duration at each rearing temperature and calculated the lower developmental threshold (t(0)) to be 20.19 degrees C based on Ikemoto and Takai (2000) and 19.38 degrees C based on a conventional line-fitting method. These values are very high relative to many other insects. The local temperature in winter does not fall below 15 degrees C, but this is much higher than the lethal limit. This suggested that critical stress in this locality was not coldness but low precipitation in winter. We estimated, based both on local temperature change and the Ikemoto and Takai's t(0), that G. argenteus required 3 years to complete its lifecycle unlike wet lowland species, where univoltinism or multi-voltinism are commonplace. Photoperiodism was observed in this species, but due to a lag between annual cycles in photoperiod, temperature, and humidity, photoperiodism alone cannot atune their lifecycle with local conditions. Synchronization in this species was achieved by three different adaptations: photoperiodism, high t(0), and large body size, which give it a long lifecycle. Although the species cannot achieve a univoltine lifecycle because of its high t0 value, it can escape from dry season by entering diapause at moderate temperatures, probably thereby achieving adaptive synchrony of lifecycle with both favorable and unfavorable seasons. A comparison between a conventional photothermogram and a newly formulated photohydrogram or photohygrogram demonstrates that even though sufficient heat is available, scarcity of water and thus scarcity of foliage should force the cricket to maintain diapause at intermediate temperature. The results suggested that high t(0), large body size, and multi-ennial lifecycle mutually affect each other and formulate a unique adaptation under such an extreme environment.																	0028-1042	1432-1904				OCT	2017	104	9-10							70	10.1007/s00114-017-1488-y								WOS:000412340100002

The dose range in which plants' growth stimulation occurs (16-20 Gy) was identified. It was shown that increased size of seedlings after irradiation with stimulating doses was due to the enhancing pace of development rather than an earlier germination. The activity of the majority of the enzymes studied increased in the range of doses that cause stimulation of seedlings development. The influences of the dose rate, the quality of seeds, their moisture and time interval between irradiation and initiation of germination on the manifestation of the effects of radiation were investigated. The experimental data on the effect of gamma-irradiation on seedlings development were significantly better explained by mathematical models that take into account the hormetic effect.

J	Budnik, RR; Miner, JG				Budnik, Richard R.; Miner, Jeffrey G.			Novel aspects of stocked juvenile steelhead emigration patterns as revealed using dual-frequency identification sonar	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We used a Dual-Frequency Identification Sonar (DIDSON) near the mouth of a small Lake Erie tributary to monitor juvenile steelhead emigration. Data were recorded continuously over two stocking seasons (April-May 2014; April June 2015) and total emigration counts were determined every hour. Fish lengths at time of emigration were estimated using the DIDSON fish measuring tool and quantified through time. Percent survival to emigration was high with >71% of individuals reaching the river mouth in both years. Photoperiod was the best predictor of peak emigration timing, and steelhead were most likely to emigrate at night. Larger individuals were more likely to emigrate shortly after stocking; however, the size range of fish that emigrated throughout the study period was wide. Residual population estimates performed after the DIDSON sampling period revealed that in both years <6% of the steelhead that were stocked remained in Trout Run by the end of June, >2 months after stocking. Most of these fish (63%) were <150 mm TL, below the typical size threshold for steelhead to emigrate. These findings provide useful information on the survivorship and residence time of stocked juvenile steelhead and indicate that multiple factors, including photoperiod and length at stocking, should be considered when determining best practices.

Molecular cloning, mRNA expression and biological activity of the pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide (PBAN) from the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis	INSECT MOLECULAR BIOLOGY												Pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide (PBAN) is a member of the pyrokinin (FXPRLamide) insect neuropeptides. Here, we report the cloning of the gene Ostnu-PBAN from the E and Z pheromone strains of the European corn borer (ECB), Ostrinia nubilalis (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), a major pest of maize. The Ostnu-PBAN genomic sequence is >5 kb in length and consists of six exons. The deduced amino acid sequence revealed a 200-residue precursor protein including a signal peptide, a 24-amino acid (aa) diapause hormone, a 37-aa PBAN and three other FXPRLamide neuropeptides. Our in vivo assays suggest that the 37-aa synthetic Ostnu-PBAN is hormonally active in the pheromone gland. It restores sex pheromone production to normal levels in mated females and decapitated virgins of both E and Z cultures. The results of a real-time PCR analysis indicated that Ostnu-PBAN mRNA levels reached a plateau in the brain-suboesophageal ganglion complexes 1 day after eclosion, and mating did not affect the mRNA expression. Three size classes of Ostnu-PBAN mRNA (1.9, 2.0 and 2.1 kb) were obtained, differing only in the length of the 3 untranslated region. However, there was no correlation between sequence divergence and the pheromone composition, voltinism or geographical origin (Hungary, Slovenia, Sweden, Turkey) of ECB moths.																	0962-1075	1365-2583				OCT	2017	26	5					616	632		10.1111/imb.12324								WOS:000409122000012	28636075

The order in which species are ranked in nested communities, as well as species traits determining community composition, can help pinpoint species vulnerable to extinction. However, these patterns remain understudied for many taxa of conservation concern and across larger spatial scales. We used a large dataset of ground beetle communities in Central European forests to test for nestedness, variation in species composition, and whether species traits can explain species composition patterns. We found only weak evidence of nestedness of ground beetle communities. However, community compositions across regions were remarkably similar. Species traits explained over half the variance in the overall occurrence ranks of ground beetle species. Wing dimorphism, breeding in both spring and autumn, and hibernation as both larval instars and as imago coincided with increasing occurrence probability, probably due to the greater flexibility of such species to adapt to fluctuating environmental conditions. In contrast, predominantly granivorous species or those with smaller geographical ranges had small occurrence ranks. These results emphasise the importance of investigating the relationships between species traits and occurrence ranks to better understand the mechanisms which shape community composition, and these relationships should be taken into consideration in conservation contexts. Our results provide a basis for the development of more effective conservation strategies in Central European forests to protect threatened ground beetle species.

Phenology of brown marmorated stink bug described using female reproductive development	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Temperature-based degree-day models describe insect seasonality and to predict key phenological events. We expand on the use of a temperature-based process defining timing of reproduction through the incorporation of female reproductive physiology for the invasive pentatomid species Halyomorpha halys, the brown marmorated stink bug. A five-stage ranking system based on ovary development was able to distinguish between the reproductive statuses of field-collected females. Application of this ranking method described aspects of H.halys' seasonality, overwintering biology, and phenology across geographic locations. Female H.halys were collected in the US from NJ, WV, NC, OR, and two sites in PA in 2006-2008 (Allentown, PA only) and 2012-2014. Results identify that H.halys enters reproductive diapause in temperate locations in the fall and that a delay occurs in developmental maturity after diapause termination in the spring. Modification of the Snyder method to identify biofix determined 12.7-hr photoperiod as the best fit to define initiation of reproduction in the spring. Applying the biofix, we demonstrated significant differences between locations for the rate at which the overwintering generation transition into reproductive status and the factors contributing to this difference require further study. For example, after including abiotic variables influencing development such as temperature and photoperiod (critical diapause cue), reproduction occurred earlier in OR and for an extended period in NJ. This data describe a method to investigate insect seasonality by incorporating physiological development across multiple regions that can clarify phenology for insects with overlapping generations.

NOVEL OBSERVATIONS OF LARVAL FIRE SURVIVAL, FEEDING BEHAVIOR, AND HOST PLANT USE IN THE REGAL FRITILLARY, SPEYERIA IDALIA (DRURY) (NYMPHALIDAE)	JOURNAL OF THE LEPIDOPTERISTS SOCIETY												Speyeria idalia is a prairie specialist that has experienced dramatic population declines throughout its range. Speyeria idalia is nearly extirpated from the eastern portion of its former range; however, populations within Kansas are relatively stable. We made several previously undescribed field observations of late-instar larvae and post-diapause female S. idalia in northeastern Kansas during 2014-2016. We report finding late-instar larvae at locations that were burned within weeks of detection. The observations of larvae shortly following a burn suggests that S. idalia larvae are capable of surviving fire and contradicts our current knowledge of this species. Additionally, we describe a feeding behavior characteristic of late-instar larvae. Larvae observed in the field and lab stripped leaves of host plants leaving only stems. This strip-style feeding behavior provided unique feeding evidence that was valuable to detecting the presence of larvae in the field. Finally, we documented larvae and post-diapause, egg depositing females using Viola sororia. The use of this relatively widespread and common plant by S. idalia populations in the Central Great Plains has only been implicitly documented but may have important conservation implications. These novel observations further our knowledge of the ecology of this imperiled species and provide timely information that may improve research and conservation management efforts directed toward S. idalia populations.																	0024-0966					SEP	2017	71	3					146	152		10.18473/lepi.71i3.a4								WOS:000409333000003

It has been an invasive species in New Zealand since 2006, heavily impacting the potato and tomato industry. The functional and numerical responses of the phytoseiid predators Amblydromalus limonicus and Neoseiulus cucumeris were examined by offering a range of prey densities (two, four, eight, 12, 16, 20, 24 and 28 TPP eggs or 1st instar nymphs) and compared on a capsicum leaf disc under 25 +/- 1 degrees C, 85% +/- 5% RH and a 14: 10 h light: dark (L:D) photoperiod. Both species displayed a type 2 functional response when fed on eggs or 1st instar nymphs of TPP, indicating an increase in the number of prey killed with an increase in prey population density. The results were analysed by using a logistic regression and Holling disc equation. A. limonicus had a higher attack rate for both eggs (0.05 +/- 0.01) and 1st instar nymphs (0.06 +/- 0.01) than N. cucumeris, which had an attack rate of (0.03 +/- 0.01) for eggs and (0.02 +/- 0.01) for 1st instar nymphs of TPP. N. cucumeris had a longer handling time for both eggs (3.68 +/- 0.67 hrs) and 1st instar nymphs (2.50 +/- 0.79 hrs) compared with A. limonicus, with a handling time of (1.74 +/- 0.23 hrs) for eggs and (1.15 +/- 0.15 hrs) for 1stinstar nymphs. A. limonicus consistently produced significantly more eggs than N. cucumeris across all densities when fed on either eggs or 1st instar nymphs of TPP. However, the results showed the lack of numerical response of both predator species to prey density. The stronger functional response of A. limonicus to TPP eggs and 1stinstar nymphs indicates that this species can potentially be a more effective biocontrol agent of TPP than N. cucumeris.

J	Lehmann, P; Van der Bijl, W; Nylin, S; Wheat, CW; Gotthard, K				Lehmann, Philipp; Van der Bijl, Wouter; Nylin, Soren; Wheat, Christopher W.; Gotthard, Karl			Timing of diapause termination in relation to variation in winter climate	PHYSIOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												In temperate insects, winters are typically endured by entering diapause, which comprises a deep resting stage. Correct timing of diapause termination is vital for synchronization of emergence with conspecifics and for mobilizing resources when conditions for growth and reproduction become favourable. Although critical to survival, the intrinsic and extrinsic drivers of diapause termination timing are poorly understood. In the present study, we investigate diapause development under a range of durations (10-24weeks) spent at different temperatures (-2 to 10 degrees C) in the pupal diapausing butterfly Pieris napi Linnaeus (Lepidoptera: Pieridae). We determine: (i) the maximum cold temperature for diapause development; (ii) if pupae in diapause count cold days or cold sums; and (iii) whether diapause termination is distinct or gradual. The results indicate large and idiosyncratic effects of high and low nonlethal temperatures on diapause development in P. napi. Although all temperatures tested lead to diapause termination, a thermal optimum between 2 and 4 degrees C is observed. Lower temperatures lead to decreased eclosion propensity, whereas higher temperatures slow down development and increase emergence desynchronization. These data suggest that, rather than a simple cold-summing process with a distinct diapause termination point, there are trade-offs between time and temperature at the low and high end of the thermal range, resulting in a nonlinear thermal landscape showing a ridge of increasing eclosion propensity at moderate temperatures. The present study suggests that the effects of temperature on diapause development should be included in projections on post-winter phenology models of insects, including pest species.					van der Bijl, Wouter/0000-0002-7366-1868												0307-6962	1365-3032				SEP	2017	42	3					232	238		10.1111/phen.12188								WOS:000409281600005

This diapause state is predominantly induced by photoperiod. The photoperiod varies with latitude and has led to local adaptation in the photoperiodic induction of diapause in many insects. To understand the rapid evolution of the photoperiodic threshold, it is important to investigate and understand the underlying genetic mechanisms. In the present study, the genetic basis of photoperiodic diapause induction is investigated in the green-veined white butterfly Pieris napi (Lepidoptera, Pieridae) by assaying diapause induction in a range of conditions for a Swedish and Spanish population. Furthermore, the inheritance of diapause induction is assessed in reciprocal F1 hybrids and backcrosses between the two populations. The southern population shows a clear photoperiodic threshold determining diapause or direct development, whereas the northern populations show a high incidence of diapause, regardless of photoperiod. The hybrid crosses reveal that the inheritance of diapause induction is strongly sex-linked, and that diapause incidence in the genetic crosses is highly dependent on photoperiod. This emphasizes the importance of assaying a range of conditions in diapause inheritance studies. The results indicate a strongly heritable diapause induction with a major component on the Z-chromosome, as well as a minor effect of the autosomal background.

CHARACTERIZATION OF TOLYPOCLADIUM CYLINDROSPORUM (HYPOCREALES: OPHIOCORDYCIPITACEAE) AND ITS IMPACT AGAINST AEDES AEGYPTI AND AEDES ALBOPICTUS EGGS AT LOW TEMPERATURE	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MOSQUITO CONTROL ASSOCIATION												We examined the growth characteristics of Tolypocladium cylindrosporum IBT 41712 and its potential to infect eggs of Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus at a low temperature (15 degrees C). When grown on Sabouraud dextrose agar supplemented with yeast extract, the IBT 41712 formed white colonies turning to a slightly darker, off-white color when mature. The mycelia bore swollen conidiophores producing smooth-walled, oblong to cylindrical conidia with varying sizes, ranging from 1.5 to 3.5 mu m long. To determine the optimum temperature for the fungus, we cultured the fungus at eight temperatures (4 degrees C, 12 degrees C, 15 degrees C, 21 degrees C, 28 degrees C, 33 degrees C, 37 degrees C, and 40 degrees C) and measured the diametric growth. The optimum temperature for growth was 28 degrees C since it had the highest diametric growth rate (2.1 +/- 0.05 mm/day) and the fastest sporulation period (within 8-10 days of incubation). There was no fungal growth at the 3 highest temperatures (33 degrees C, 37 degrees C, and 40 degrees C) but plates incubated at 33 degrees C, when shifted to optimal temperature (28 degrees C), showed visible growth indicating that following incubation at 33 degrees C, the fungus remained viable. The IBT 41712 successfully infected mosquito eggs at 15 degrees C. Fungal treatment induced egg hatch on moist seed-germination paper and this effect was more pronounced in Ae. aegypti compared to Ae. albopictus. When treated eggs were immersed in dH(2)O 21 days posttreatment, larval hatch of both Ae. aegypti (control = 91%, 1 x 10(7) conidia/ml, fungal treatment - 0%) and Ae. albopictus (control - 85%, fungal treatment - 28%) was significantly lower in fungal treatment compared to the controls. The ability of the strain to grow in a wide temperature range, and effectively infect mosquito eggs and induce egg hatch at a low temperature warrants further investigation for its potential as a mosquito control agent targeting eggs that overwinter or undergo long diapause.																	8756-971X	1943-6270				SEP	2017	33	3					184	192		10.2987/16-6596R.1								WOS:000408636500002	28854112					
J	Lovis, L; Grandjean, M; Overney, L; Seewald, W; Sager, H				Lovis, Leonore; Grandjean, Melanie; Overney, Laurence; Seewald, Wolfgang; Sager, Heinz			Seasonality and circadian variation of microfilaremia in dogs experimentally infected with Dirofilaria immitis	VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY												Periodicity, the cyclical rise and fall in microfilaria (mff) numbers in the peripheral blood over time, is observed in many filarial infections. It is correlated with the necessity for these larval stages to be ingested by the blood feeding vector before they can be transmitted to a new vertebrate host. Microfilariae of the dog heartworm Dirofilaria immitis have been described to show periodicity, but the circadian pattern does not seem to be consistent. Most publications describe the lowest mff-concentrations in the peripheral blood in the early morning, while the highest counts occurred either in the afternoon, in the late evening or shortly after midnight. Sixteen dogs were experimentally infected with D. immitis isolates originating from Italy (one isolate, 14 dogs), and the USA (two isolates, one dog each). The dogs were housed indoors with a natural light source (windows) and heating that prevented temperature-drops below 20 degrees C during winter. When patency was reached, blood samples were collected at weekly and monthly intervals over a period of up to 3 years, and at given hours of the day (morning, noon, evening) for the duration of one year in order to determine seasonal, as well as daily variations of microfilaremia. Despite the fact that the dogs were kept indoors, there was an apparent seasonality of the D. immitis-microfilaremia, with peaks in summer and 5-49-times lower counts in winter. This difference was statistically significant and the ratio remained constant over the years, regardless of the fact that the mff-counts increased from the first to the second year of patency. Since the temperature was kept constantly in a range between 20 to 26 degrees C (with some single outliners in both directions) the climatic conditions may not explain this observation. Therefore, day length may be the most obvious reason for the seasonality in the given study set-up. Interestingly, the Italian D. immitis-isolate lost seasonality after three passages of experimental infections in dogs. The circadian cycle of mff in the peripheral blood varied considerably between dogs and season. There was no consistent or apparent pattern, which led to the conclusion that many individual factors seem to influence the appearance of mff in the peripheral blood, even, or especially, under standardized environmental conditions.																	0304-4017	1873-2550				AUG 30	2017	243						235	241		10.1016/j.vetpar.2017.07.010								WOS:000409287900040	28807299

Birds in the temperate regions use the changes of day length to time their behavior. However, at equatorial latitudes the photoperiod remains almost constant throughout the year, and it is unclear which cues songbirds use to regulate behaviors, such as singing. Here, we investigated the timing of dawn-song of male silver-beaked tanagers in the equatorial lowland Amazonas over two years. In this region, birds experience around nine minutes of annual day length variation, with sunrise times varying by 32 minutes over the year. We show that the seasonal timing of dawn-song was highly regular between years, and was strongly correlated with slight increases in day length. During the singing season the daily dawn-song onset was precisely aligned to variations in twilight time. Thus, although photoperiodic changes near the equator are minimal, songbirds can use day length variation to time singing.																	2045-2322					AUG 22	2017	7								9140	10.1038/s41598-017-08800-6								WOS:000408167700001	28831057

Effects of a social cue on reproductive development and pre-alternate molt in seasonally breeding migrant and resident female songbirds (Zonotrichia leucophrys)	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY												To time reproduction optimally, birds have evolved diverse mechanisms by which they respond to environmental changes that help them anticipate and prepare for the breeding season. While residents initiate reproductive preparation and breed in the same geographic location, migrant birds simultaneously prepare for breeding and migration far from their breeding grounds. As a result, it is hypothesized that migrant and resident birds use environmental cues differently to prepare to breed and that there is adaptive specialization in mechanisms regulating reproductive preparation. Specifically, residents are expected to rely more on non-photic cues (e.g. food, temperature, social cues) than migrants. We tested this general prediction using a social cue manipulation. First, we compared the effects of subspecies-appropriate recorded male song on reproductive development in migrants and residents on a naturally increasing photoperiod. Second, we tested the sensitivity of migrant-specific life history events (fattening and pre-alternate molt) to song treatment. After 82 days, residents had higher luteinizing hormone and greater ovarian development than migrants, but song treatment had no effect on these metrics in either subspecies. Song advanced pre-alternate molt but had no effect on fattening in migrants. While our study does not support specialization in social cue use in migrants and residents, it is consistent with findings in the literature of specialization in photoperiodic response. It also demonstrates for the first time that social cues can influence molt in a migrant species. Additional findings from a pilot study looking at responses to a live male suggest it is important to test other kinds of social cues.

Diel pattern of corticosterone metabolites in Arctic barnacle goslings (Branta leucopsis) under continuous natural light	PLOS ONE												Here we describe the excretion pattern of corticosterone metabolites collected from droppings in barnacle goslings (Branta leucopsis) raised under 24 hours of continuous natural light in the Arctic. In lower latitudes, circulating corticosterone peaks around waking and shows a nadir between midnight and 4:00, whereas the peak and nadir are time-delayed slightly when measuring corticosterone metabolites from droppings. Photoperiod, along with other environmental factors, helps to entrain an animal's endogenous rhythm to that of the natural world. North of the Arctic Circle, photoperiod may not be a reliable cue as light is continuously absent during the winter and continuously present during the summer. Here, for the first time, we used droppings to describe a 24-hour excretion pattern of corticosterone metabolites (CORTm). By applying circular statistics for dependent data, we found a diel rhythmic pattern even under continuous natural light. We discuss potential alternative 'Zeitgeber' that may function even in the polar regions, focusing on melatonin. We propose a line of research to measure melatonin non-invasively from droppings. We also provide a validation of the adopted enzyme immunoassay (EIA) that was originally developed for greylag geese.

Nonannual tree rings in a climate-sensitive Prioria copaifera chronology in the Atrato River, Colombia	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												In temperate climates, tree growth dormancy usually ensures the annual nature of tree rings, but in tropical environments, determination of annual periodicity can be more complex. The purposes of the work are as follows: (1) to generate a reliable tree-ring width chronology for Prioria copaifera Griseb. (Leguminoceae), a tropical tree species dwelling in the Atrato River floodplains, Colombia; (2) to assess the climate signal recorded by the tree-ring records; and (3) to validate the annual periodicity of the tree rings using independent methods. We used standard dendrochronological procedures to generate the P. copaifera tree-ring chronology. We used Pearson correlations to evaluate the relationship of the chronology with the meteorological records, climate regional indices, and gridded precipitation/sea surface temperature products. We also evaluated 24 high-precision C-14 measurements spread over a range of preselected tree rings, with assigned calendar years by dendrochronological techniques, before and after the bomb spike in order to validate the annual nature of the tree rings. The tree-ring width chronology was statistically reliable, and it correlated significantly with local records of annual and October-December (OND) streamflow and precipitation across the upper river watershed (positive), and OND temperature (negative). It was also significantly related to the Oceanic Nino Index, Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and the Southern Oscillation Index, as well as sea surface temperatures over the Caribbean and the Pacific region. However, C-14 high-precision measurements over the tree rings demonstrated offsets of up to 40 years that indicate that P. copaifera can produce more than one ring in certain years. Results derived from the strongest climate-growth relationship during the most recent years of the record suggest that the climatic signal reported may be due to the presence of annual rings in some of those trees in recent years. Our study alerts about the risk of applying dendrochronology in species with challenging anatomical features defining tree rings, commonly found in the tropics, without an independent validation of annual periodicity of tree rings. High-precision C-14 measurements in multiple trees are a useful method to validate the identification of annual tree rings.																	2045-7758					AUG	2017	7	16					6334	6345		10.1002/ece3.2905								WOS:000409528000025	28861237

While the first often depends on temperature, the latter is temperature-compensated over a physiologically relevant range. Here, we explored the locomotor activity of the temperate housefly Musca domestica. Under low temperatures, activity was centered round a major and broad afternoon peak, while high temperatures resulted in activity throughout the photophase with a mild midday depression, which was especially pronounced in males exposed to long photoperiods. While period (per) mRNA peaked earlier under low temperatures, no temperature-dependent splicing of the last per 3 ' end intron was identified. The expression of timeless, vrille, and Par domain protein 1 was also influenced by temperature, each in a different manner. Our data indicated that comparable behavioral trends in daily activity distribution have evolved in Drosophila melanogaster and M. domestica, yet the behaviors of these two species are orchestrated by different molecular mechanisms.

Survival and Feeding Rates of Four Aphid Species (Hemiptera: Aphididae) on Various Sucrose Concentrations in Diets	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY												Different concentrations of sucrose were used to investigate how survival and feeding was affected in four species of aphids (Hemiptera: Aphididae). Seven sucrose concentrations were evaluated in feeding chambers fitted with parafilm membranes and infested with nymphs of Aphis glycines Matsumura, Diuraphis noxia Kurdjumov, Myzus persicae Sulzer, or Schizaphis graminum Rondani at 25 degrees C and a photoperiod of 14:10 (L:D) h. Survival on each diet was recorded 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 d. Diet volumes (mu l) consumed and amounts of honeydew produced were then determined. Aphid survival differed significantly by concentration, time (d), and aphid species. Aphis glycines survival was highest (83.8%) on 30% sucrose although percent survival in the 70's occurred on concentrations ranging from 15-25%. Diuraphis noxia survival was highest on the 15 and 20% sucrose concentrations. Survival for Myzus persicae was optimal on 20% sucrose (92%) but did not differ that much (5%) on concentrations of 15-35%. Schizaphis graminum survival (93.0-93.6%) was highest on sucrose concentrations ranging from 20-30% sucrose. Myzus persicae and S. graminum, which feed on a wide-range of host plants, were overall more adapted to feeding on a wider range of sucrose concentrations than the more host-restricted aphid species, A. glycines. Diet consumption by A. glycines did not vary on the sucrose concentrations, but D. noxia and M. persicae exhibited increased consumption on diets that provided optimal survival. Results will aid in the design of short-term studies using sucrose-only diets to evaluate effects of bioactive materials on aphid survival for up to 11 d.																	0022-0493	1938-291X				AUG	2017	110	4					1518	1524		10.1093/jee/tox168								WOS:000407164900017	28637212

Upper lethal temperatures in three cold-tolerant insects are higher in winter than in summer	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY												Upper lethal temperatures (ULTs) of cold-adapted insect species in winter have not been previously examined. We anticipated that as the lower lethal temperatures (LLTs) decreased (by 20-30 degrees C) with the onset of winter, the ULTs would also decrease accordingly. Consequently, given the recent increases in winter freeze-thaw cycles and warmer winters due to climate change, it became of interest to determine whether ambient temperatures during thaws were approaching ULTs during the cold seasons. However, beetle Dendroides canadensis (Coleoptera: Pyrochroidae) larvae had higher 24 and 48 h ULT50 (the temperature at which 50% mortality occurred) in winter than in summer. The 24 and 48 h ULT50 for D. canadensis in winter were 40.9 and 38.7 degrees C, respectively. For D. canadensis in summer, the 24 and 48 h ULT50 were 36.7 and 36.4 degrees C. During the transition periods of spring and autumn, the 24 h ULT50 was 37.3 and 38.5 degrees C, respectively. While D. canadensis in winter had a 24 h LT50 range between LLT and ULT of 64 degrees C, the summer range was only 41 degrees C. Additionally, larvae of the beetle Cucujus clavipes clavipes (Coleoptera: Cucujidae) and the cranefly Tipula trivittata (Diptera: Tipulidae) also had higher ULTs in winter than in summer. This unexpected phenomenon of increased temperature survivorship at both lower and higher temperatures in the winter compared with that in the summer has not been previously documented. With the decreased high temperature tolerance as the season progresses from winter to summer, it was observed that environmental temperatures are closest to upper lethal temperatures in spring.																	0022-0949	1477-9145				AUG 1	2017	220	15					2726	2732		10.1242/jeb.161331								WOS:000407024800014	28768748

Bradley St.			Photoperiod cues and patterns of genetic variation limit phenological responses to climate change in warm parts of species' range: Modeling diameter-growth cessation in coast Douglas-fir	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												The phenology of diameter-growth cessation in trees will likely play a key role in mediating species and ecosystem responses to climate change. A common expectation is that warming will delay cessation, but the environmental and genetic influences on this process are poorly understood. We modeled the effects of temperature, photoperiod, and seed-source climate on diameter-growth-cessation timing in coast Douglas-fir (an ecologically and economically vital tree) using high-frequency growth measurements across broad environmental gradients for a range of genotypes from different seed sources. Our model suggests that cool temperatures or short photoperiods can induce cessation in autumn. At cool locations (high latitude and elevation), cessation seems to be induced primarily by low temperatures in early autumn (under relatively long photoperiods), so warming will likely delay cessation and extend the growing season. But at warm locations (low latitude or elevation), cessation seems to be induced primarily by short photoperiods later in autumn, so warming will likely lead to only slight extensions of the growing season, "reflecting photoperiod limitations on phenological shifts. Trees from seed sources experiencing frequent frosts in autumn or early winter tended to cease growth earlier in the autumn, potentially as an adaptation to avoid frost. Thus, gene flow into populations in warm locations with little frost will likely have limited potential to delay mean cessation dates because these populations already cease growth relatively late. In addition, data from an abnormal heat wave suggested that very high temperatures during long photoperiods in early summer might also induce cessation. Climate change could make these conditions more common in warm locations, leading to much earlier cessation. Thus, photoperiod cues, patterns of genetic variation, and summer heat waves could limit the capacity of coast Douglas-fir to extend its growing season in response to climate change in the warm parts of its range.																	1354-1013	1365-2486				AUG	2017	23	8					3348	3362		10.1111/gcb.13690								WOS:000404863300032	28303652

Temperature-dependent development of the great European spruce bark beetle Dendroctonus micans (Kug.) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae) and its predator Rhizophagus grandis Gyll. (Coleoptera: Monotomidae: Rhizophaginae)	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST ENTOMOLOGY												1 Dendroctonus micans is an invasive species that has spread throughout Britain, which prompts the question: how is the voltinism of this pest and its biocontrol agent Rhizophagus grandis affected by climate? 2 Dendroctonus micans and R. grandis were reared at a range of constant temperatures. Lower developmental threshold temperature (LDT) and day degree (DD) requirements for the egg, larval and pupal stage of D. micans were estimated to be 7.4 degrees C 153 DD, 6.6 degrees C 527 DD and 7.2 degrees C 126 DD, respectively. At 12.5, 15 and 17.5 degrees C, prior to prepupal cell formation, fifth-instar larvae underwent a diapause, which has not been observed previously in this species. Prepupal development rate also did not increase linearly with temperature. 3 For R. grandis, the LDT and DD requirements for the egg, larval, prepupal and pupal stages were 5.7 degrees C 84 DD, 6.2 degrees C 263 DD, 8.1 degrees C 90 DD and 6.8 degrees C 178 DD, respectively. At 12.5 and 15 degrees C, most prepupae failed to pupate, which is indicative of a facultative diapause. 4 The key developmental parameters reported in the present study may be used to model the phenology of the beetles throughout their range, providing better-timed control strategies or to predict outbreak risk under climate change as a result of reduced biocontrol effectiveness.																	1461-9555	1461-9563				AUG	2017	19	3					321	331		10.1111/afe.12212								WOS:000404637500010						
J	Kozanitas, M; Osmundson, TW; Linzer, R; Garbelotto, M				Kozanitas, Melina; Osmundson, Todd W.; Linzer, Rachel; Garbelotto, Matteo			Interspecific interactions between the Sudden Oak Death pathogen Phytophthora ramorum and two sympatric Phytophthora species in varying ecological conditions	FUNGAL ECOLOGY												Even when introduced invasive pathogens lack their natural predators or competitors, they must still interact with other organisms in their introduced range. Sudden Oak Death (SOD), caused by Phytophthora ramorum (Oomycota), is an introduced disease causing large-scale tree mortality. Two additional Phytophthora species, Phytophthora nemorosa and Phytophthora pseudosyringae, cause significantly lower oak mortality, yet they also commonly colonize leaves of Umbellularia californica, the major transmissive host of SOD in California. We combined field surveys and inoculation experiments to understand disease prevalence dynamics and competitive interactions among these pathogen species. Despite the broader geographic distribution of P. nemorosa with respect to that of P. ramorum, our results suggest that P. nemorosa exhibits a narrower ecological amplitude and, in any given region, occupies fewer sites than P. ramorum. Our results additionally suggest that, perhaps due to priority effects, P. nemorosa can persist at levels comparable to those of P. ramorum in ecologically suitable plots when climate favors P. ramorum dormancy. However, P. ramorum prevalence increases to levels higher than those of the competing species when abundant rainfall triggers its sporulation. Understanding the determinants and outcomes of competition between these species has important implications for understanding the epidemiology and possible control strategies for Sudden Oak Death.

Codling Moth (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) Establishment in China: Stages of Invasion and Potential Future Distribution	JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE												Codling moth (Cydia pomonella L.) is an internal feeding pest of apples and can cause substantial economic losses to fruit growers due to larval feeding which in turn degrades fruit quality and can result in complete crop loss if left uncontrolled. Although this pest originally developed in central Asia, it was not known to occur in China until 1953. For the first three decades the spread of codling moth within China was slow. Within the last three decades, addition of new commercial apple orchards and improved transportation, this pest has spread to over 131 counties in seven provinces in China. We developed regional (China) and global ecological niche models using MaxEnt to identify areas at highest potential risk of codling moth establishment and spread. Our objectives were to 1) predict the potential distribution of codling moth in China, 2) identify the important environmental factors associated with codling moth distribution in China, and 3) identify the different stages of invasion of codling moth in China. Human footprint, annual temperature range, precipitation of wettest quarter, and degree days >= 10 degrees C were the most important predictors associated with codling moth distribution. Our analysis identified areas where codling moth has the potential to establish, and mapped the different stages of invasion (i.e., potential for population stabilization, colonization, adaptation, and sink) of codling moth in China. Our results can be used in effective monitoring and management to stem the spread of codling moth in China.																	1536-2442	2250-2645				JUL 14	2017	17								85	10.1093/jisesa/iex054								WOS:000412434500001						
J	Sniegula, S; Golab, MJ; Johansson, F				Sniegula, Szymon; Golab, Maria J.; Johansson, Frank			Cannibalism and activity rate in larval damselflies increase along a latitudinal gradient as a consequence of time constraints	BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY												Background: Predation is ubiquitous in nature. One form of predation is cannibalism, which is affected by many factors such as size structure and resource density. However, cannibalism may also be influenced by abiotic factors such as seasonal time constraints. Since time constraints are greater at high latitudes, cannibalism could be stronger at such latitudes, but we know next to nothing about latitudinal variation in cannibalism. In this study, we examined cannibalism and activity in larvae of the damselfly Lestes sponsa along a latitudinal gradient across Europe. We did this by raising larvae from the egg stage at different temperatures and photoperiods corresponding to different latitudes. Results: We found that the more seasonally time-constrained populations in northern latitudes and individuals subjected to greater seasonal time constraints exhibited a higher level of cannibalism. We also found that activity was higher at north latitude conditions, and thus correlated with cannibalism, suggesting that this behaviour mediates higher levels of cannibalism in time-constrained animals. Conclusions: Our results go counter to the classical latitude-predation pattern which predicts higher predation at lower latitudes, since we found that predation was stronger at higher latitudes. The differences in cannibalism might have implications for population dynamics along the latitudinal gradients, but further experiments are needed to explore this.																	1471-2148					JUL 14	2017	17								167	10.1186/s12862-017-1010-3								WOS:000405690000002	28709398

We found evidence for such a response in the examination of the life history traits of the cabbage beetle Colaphellus bowringi from 6 different geographical populations at 16, 19, 22, 24, 26 and 28 degrees C. Our results showed that larval and pupal development times significantly decreased as rearing temperature increased, and that growth rates were positively correlated with temperature. Body weight tended to decrease with increasing temperature, consistent with the general pattern in ectothermic animals. Larval development time was positively correlated with latitude, whereas the growth rate decreased as latitude increased, showing an example of latitudinal cogradient variation. Body weight significantly decreased with increasing latitude in a stepwise manner, showing a negative latitudinal body weight cline. Females were significantly larger than males, consistent with the female biased sex dimorphism in insects. Body weight tended to decrease with increasing rearing temperature, whereas the differences in sexual size dimorphism (SSD) tended to decrease with increasing body weight, which biased our results toward acceptance of Rensch's rule. We found that weight loss was an important regulator of SSD, and because male pupae lost significantly more weight at metamorphosis than female pupae, SSD was greater in adults than in pupae. Overall, our data provide a new example that a latitudinal cogradient variation in physiological traits is associated with a negative latitudinal body weight cline.																	1932-6203					JUL 12	2017	12	7							e0181030	10.1371/journal.pone.0181030								WOS:000405649600053	28704496

Proteogenomic analysis of the total and surface-exposed proteomes of Plasmodium vivax salivary gland sporozoites	PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES												Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax cause the majority of human malaria cases. Research efforts predominantly focus on P. falciparum because of the clinical severity of infection and associated mortality rates. However, P. vivax malaria affects more people in a wider global range. Furthermore, unlike P. falciparum, P. vivax can persist in the liver as dormant hypnozoites that can be activated weeks to years after primary infection, causing relapse of symptomatic blood stages. This feature makes P. vivax unique and difficult to eliminate with the standard tools of vector control and treatment of symptomatic blood stage infection with antimalarial drugs. Infection by Plasmodium is initiated by the mosquito-transmitted sporozoite stage, a highly motile invasive cell that targets hepatocytes in the liver. The most advanced malaria vaccine for P. falciparum (RTS, S, a subunit vaccine containing of a portion of the major sporozoite surface protein) conferred limited protection in Phase III trials, falling short of WHO-established vaccine efficacy goals. However, blocking the sporozoite stage of infection in P. vivax, before the establishment of the chronic liver infection, might be an effective malaria vaccine strategy to reduce the occurrence of relapsing blood stages. It is also thought that a multivalent vaccine comprising multiple sporozoite surface antigens will provide better protection, but a comprehensive analysis of proteins in P. vivax sporozoites is not available. To inform sporozoite-based vaccine development, we employed mass spectrometry-based proteomics to identify nearly 2,000 proteins present in P. vivax salivary gland sporozoites. Analysis of protein post-translational modifications revealed extensive phosphorylation of glideosome proteins as well as regulators of transcription and translation. Additionally, the sporozoite surface proteins CSP and TRAP, which were recently discovered to be glycosylated in P. falciparum salivary gland sporozoites, were also observed to be similarly modified in P. vivax sporozoites. Quantitative comparison of the P. vivax and P. falciparum salivary gland sporozoite proteomes revealed a high degree of similarity in protein expression levels, including among invasion-related proteins. Nevertheless, orthologs with significantly different expression levels between the two species could be identified, as well as highly abundant, species-specific proteins with no known orthologs. Finally, we employed chemical labeling of live sporozoites to isolate and identify 36 proteins that are putatively surface-exposed on P. vivax salivary gland sporozoites. In addition to identifying conserved sporozoite surface proteins identified by similar analyses of other Plasmodium species, our analysis identified several as-yet uncharacterized proteins, including a putative 6-Cys protein with no known ortholog in P. falciparum.

J	Black, C; Rey, AR; Hart, T				Black, Caitlin; Raya Rey, Andrea; Hart, Tom			Peeking into the bleak midwinter: Investigating nonbreeding strategies of Gentoo Penguins using a camera network	AUK												When monitoring species with extensive ranges in harsh climates, comprehensive studies across a species' range are both logistically and technically challenging and therefore rare. Such scarcity in data collection is particularly true in the polar regions where sea ice and weather constraints prevent widespread access to sites for much of the year, specifically during winter. Penguins (Spheniscidae) show large variations in winter strategies with many species migrating long distances while others are distinctly sedentary, remaining at the colony year- round. However, in some species, their attendance at the breeding site during the nonbreeding winter period depends greatly on the colony location and environmental factors. Here we aim to examine fluctuations in winter attendance at the breeding site in Gentoo Penguins (Pygoscelis papua) along a latitudinal gradient of 7 sites, ranging from Martillo Island, a colony in Argentina, to Petermann Island, a colony located toward the southern edge of the species' range on the Western Antarctic Peninsula. We use an established network of cameras to observe winter populations of penguins across a large latitudinal gradient. This study provides the first evidence of across- year variation in Gentoo Penguin nonbreeding attendance at the breeding site. We found that both temporal and spatial factors drive winter attendance in this species with distinct patterns between years and colony locations, particularly at the edges of its range. Additionally, environmental and temporal factors, including sea ice extent directly offshore and photoperiod, appear to dictate Gentoo Penguin winter attendance across their range. As Gentoo Penguins are neither sedentary nor migratory during the nonbreeding period, understanding patterns in winter site occupation across time and space provides insight into half of the species' annual cycle and has important implications in the face of changes in climate, direct human disturbance, and fisheries activities.																	0004-8038	1938-4254				JUL	2017	134	3					520	529		10.1642/AUK-16-69.1								WOS:000405095500004						
J	Pratt, AC; Smith, KT; Beck, JL				Pratt, Aaron C.; Smith, Kurt T.; Beck, Jeffrey L.			Environmental cues used by Greater Sage- Grouse to initiate altitudinal migration	AUK												Migration is a behavioral strategy to access resources that change across a landscape. Animals must ultimately interpret cues to properly time movements that match changing resource quality. Many animals do this by responding primarily to indirect indicators of resource quality such as an internal biological clock or photoperiod. Others are heavily dependent on more direct indicators such as weather or plant phenology. Timing of movement also can be modified by factors specific to individuals. We used time-to-event models for Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) to investigate whether an altitudinal avian migrant was influenced by direct indicators of resource quality when timing migration, and whether timing was influenced by individual characteristics, during the spring (winter to breeding range), summer (breeding to summer range), and fall (summer to winter range) transitional seasons. Greater Sage-Grouse interpreted direct indicators of resource quality, especially temperature, when timing movements between seasonal ranges. Timing was also dependent on individual characteristics including location, reproductive status, and habitat use. After we identified which migration cues were important, we evaluated if migratory and nonmigratory individuals were experiencing similar environmental conditions, which may partly explain why there are different behaviors in a partially migrant population. For the summer and fall transitions, migratory grouse experienced more stimulatory migration cues because of differences in elevation of seasonal ranges. Migratory birds were likely avoiding more rapid plant desiccation in warmer breeding ranges and avoiding higher snow accumulation in colder summer ranges with more precipitation. Altitudinal migrants are likely to use direct indicator cues because they have great utility when migration distances are relatively short. In addition, landscapes with altitudinal migrants have sharp environmental gradients creating conditions conducive for partially migratory behavior in a population.																	0004-8038	1938-4254				JUL	2017	134	3					628	643		10.1642/AUK-16-192.1								WOS:000405095500014

Hibernation-based blood loss therapy increases survivability of lethal hemorrhagic shock in rats	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY					15th International Hibernation Symposium	JUL 31-AUG 04, 2016	Las Vegas, NV					A small-volume (1 ml/kg) resuscitation fluid based on metabolic adaptations in hibernating mammals was optimized using a rat model of hemorrhagic shock. A previous study of this therapy tested only one concentration of three specific components: 4 M D-stereoisomer of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), 43 mM melatonin, and 20% DMSO. In this study, we considered the range of concentrations of BHB and melatonin seen during the physiological extremes of rapid arousal from hypothermic torpor in natural hibernators and applied these to the non-hibernating Sprague-Dawley rat model. These extremes normally result in ischemia and reperfusion injury in non-hibernating mammals. Dose-ranging studies were conducted for BHB and melatonin in rats with 60% blood loss. BHB was administered at either 4, 2, or 0.4 M concentration in conjunction with 4.3 mM melatonin and 10% DMSO. Subsequently, melatonin was administered at either 4.3, 0.43, 0.0043, 0.000043, or 0 mM in conjunction with 4 M BHB and 2% DMSO. 10-day mean survival showed a dose-dependent trend: rats survived longer with higher concentration of infused BHB (4 M BHB, 7.38 +/- 1.75 days; 2 M BHB, 5.25 +/- 2.22 days; 0.4 M BHB, 2.07 +/- 2.05 days). Administering 4 M BHB without melatonin resulted in low mean survival times (4.38 +/- 1.42 days). All treatments containing both 4 M BHB and melatonin, regardless of melatonin concentration, resulted in mean survival times of similar to 7.5 days. We conclude there is a dose-dependent trend in which higher BHB concentration resulted in improved survival over 10 days.																	0174-1578	1432-136X				JUL	2017	187	5-6			SI		769	778		10.1007/s00360-017-1076-7								WOS:000404211800009	28324159

However, torpor has many other functions that ultimately increase the survival of heterothermic mammals and birds. In this review, we summarize new findings revealing that animals use torpor to cope with the conditions during and after natural disasters, including fires, storms, and heat waves. Furthermore, we suggest that torpor, which also prolongs longevity and was likely crucial for survival of mammals during the time of the dinosaur extinctions, will be advantageous in a changing world. Climate change is assumed to lead to an increase in the occurrence and intensity of climatic disasters, such as those listed above and also abnormal floods, droughts, and extreme temperatures. The opportunistic use of torpor, found in many heterothermic species, will likely enhance survival of these challenges, because these species can reduce energy and foraging requirements. However, many strictly seasonal hibernators will likely face the negative consequences of the predicted increase in temperature, such as range contraction. Overall, available data suggest that opportunistic heterotherms with their flexible energy requirements have an adaptive advantage over homeotherms in response to unpredictable conditions.

George			Seed Bank Depletion: The Key to Long-Term Downy Brome (Bromus tectorum L.) Management	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT												Invasive winter annual grasses such as downy brome (Bromus tectorum L.) are a threat to native ecosystems throughout the United States. Downy brome is able to exploit moisture and nutrients throughout the fall and early spring before native plants break dormancy. This results in decreased native species abundance and development of monotypic downy brome stands. Short-term downy brome management has been shown to be effective; however, the soil seed reserve has often been overlooked, although it's the mechanism responsible for rapid reestablishment. This field study was conducted at two sites in Colorado to evaluate the longevity of the downy brome soil seed reserve and its implications on long-term downy brome control. Glyphosate plus adjuvant applications were made for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 consecutive years. Downy brome and perennial grass biomass harvests were conducted yearly to determine changes in species composition. In addition, soil cores were collected to evaluate the yearly variation and depletion of the downy brome soil seed bank in response to consecutive glyphosate applications. We found that 1-3 yr of consecutive glyphosate treatments were insufficient to deplete the downy brome soil seed bank. Downy brome biomass and the soil seed bank recovered within 1-2 yr after glyphosate treatments were terminated; however, 4 and 5 consecutive yr of glyphosate applications were sufficient to control downy brome through depletion of the soil seed bank. Managing downy brome for 4-5 consecutive yr resulted in a 4- to 9-fold increase in perennial grass biomass. These data suggest that long-term management of downy brome is dependent on eliminating the soil seed bank using a multiyear approach. (C) 2017 The Society for Range Management.

Torpor Patterns in Desert Hedgehogs (Paraechinus aethiopicus) Represent Another New Point along a Thermoregulatory Continuum	PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL ZOOLOGY												Documenting variation in thermoregulatory patterns across phylogenetically and geographically diverse taxa is key to understanding the evolution of endothermy and heterothermy in birds and mammals. We recorded body temperature (T-b) in free-ranging desert hedgehogs (Paraechinus aethiopicus) across three seasons in the deserts of Saudi Arabia. Modal T-b's (35 degrees-36.5 degrees C) were slightly below normal for mammals but still warmer than those of other hedgehogs. The single maximum T-b recorded was 39.2 degrees C, which is cooler than maximum T-b's recorded in most desert mammals. Desert hedgehogs commonly used torpor during winter and spring but never during summer. Torpor bouts occurred frequently but irregularly, and most lasted less than 24 h. Unlike daily heterotherms, desert hedgehogs did occasionally remain torpid for more than 24 h, including one bout of 101 h. Body temperatures during torpor were often within 2 degrees-3 degrees C of ambient temperature; however, we never recorded repeated bouts of long, predictable torpor punctuated by brief arousal periods similar to those common among seasonal hibernators. Thus, desert hedgehogs can be included on the ever-growing list of species that display torpor patterns intermediate to traditionally defined hibernators and daily heterotherms. Extant hedgehogs are a recent radiation within an ancient family, and the intermediate thermoregulatory pattern displayed by desert hedgehogs is unlike the deeper and more regular torpor seen in other hedgehogs, suggesting that this may be a derived-as opposed to ancestral-trait in this subfamily. We suggest that this family (Erinaceidae) and order (Eulipotyphla) may be important for understanding the evolution of thermoregulatory patterns among Laurasiatheria and mammals in general.

In China, the endemic Apis cerana cerana exhibits stronger cold hardiness than Western honey bees, making the former species important pollinators of winter-flowering plants. Although studies have examined behavioral and physiological mechanisms underlying cold resistance in bees, data are scarce regarding the exact molecular mechanisms. Here, we investigated gene expression in A. c. cerana under two temperature treatments, using transcriptomic analysis to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and relevant biological processes, respectively. Across the temperature treatments, 501 DEGs were identified. A gene ontology analysis showed that DEGs were enriched in pathways related to sugar and amino acid biosynthesis and metabolism, as well as calcium ion channel activity. Additionally, heat shock proteins, zinc finger proteins, and serine/threonine-protein kinases were differentially expressed between the two treatments. The results of this study provide a general digital expression profile of thermoregulation genes responding to cold hardiness in A. c. cerana. Our data should prove valuable for future research on cold tolerance mechanisms in insects, and may be beneficial in breeding efforts to improve bee hardiness.																	1932-6203					JUN 26	2017	12	6							e0179922	10.1371/journal.pone.0179922								WOS:000404537300030	28650988

Birds of a feather flock together: Insights into starling murmuration behaviour revealed using citizen science	PLOS ONE												Pre-roost murmuration displays by European starlings Sturnus vulgaris are a spectacular example of collective animal behaviour. To date, empirical research has focussed largely on flock movement and biomechanics whereas research on possible causal mechanisms that affect flock size and murmuration duration has been limited and restricted to a small number of sites. Possible explanations for this behaviour include reducing predation through the dilution, detection or predator confusion effects (the "safer together" hypotheses) or recruiting more birds to create larger (warmer) roosts (the "warmer together" hypothesis). We collected data on size, duration, habitat, temperature and predators from >3,000 murmurations using citizen science. Sightings were submitted from 23 countries but UK records predominated. Murmurations occurred across a range of habitats but there was no association between habitat and size/duration. Size increased significantly from October to early February, followed by a decrease until the end of the season in March (overall mean 30,082 birds; maximum 750,000 birds). Mean duration was 26 minutes (+/- 44 seconds SEM). Displays were longest at the start/end of the season, probably due to a significant positive relationship with day length. Birds of prey were recorded at 29.6% of murmurations. The presence of predators including harrier Circus, peregrine Falco peregrinus, and sparrowhawk Accipiter nisus was positively correlated with murmuration size (R-2 = 0.401) and duration (R-2 =0.258), especially when these species were flying near to, or actively engaging with, starlings. Temperature was negatively correlated with duration but the effect was much weaker than that of day length. When predators were present, murmurations were statistically more likely to end with all birds going down en masse to roost rather than dispersing from the site. Our findings suggest that starling murmurations are primarily an anti-predator adaptation rather than being undertaken to attract larger numbers of individuals to increase roost warmth.																	1932-6203					JUN 19	2017	12	6							e0179277	10.1371/journal.pone.0179277								WOS:000404043100023	28628640

Petteri			Raccoon dog model shows preservation of bone during prolonged catabolism and reduced physical activity	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY												The raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides) is a promising animal model capable of preventing disuse-induced osteoporosis. Previous data suggest that this species resembles bears in the preservation of bone mass and biomechanical properties during prolonged passivity and catabolism. This longitudinal study examined the osteological properties of tibiae in farm-bred raccoon dogs that were either fed or fasted (n=6 per group) for a 10 week period. Peripheral quantitative computed tomography was utilized and plasma markers of bone turnover measured before fasting and at 9 weeks followed by mechanical testing (three-point bending), micro-computed tomography and Fourier transform infrared imaging at 10 weeks. Passive wintering with prolonged catabolism (body mass loss 32%) had no significant effects on bone mineralization, porosity or strength. The concentration of C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen, indicative of bone resorption, increased in the plasma of the fasted raccoon dogs, while the bone formation markers were unchanged. The levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were reduced in the fasted animals. Based on these data, the preservation of bone in wintering raccoon dogs shares characteristics with that of bears with no apparent decrease in the formation of bone but increased resorption. To conclude, raccoon dogs were able to minimize bone loss during a 10 week period of catabolism and passivity.

Local adaptation, intrapopulation adult emergence patterns, sex and prolonged diapause regulate the rate of postwinter development in pupae of the European cherry fruit fly	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY												We used the European cherry fruit fly, Rhagoletis cerasi (Diptera: Tephritidae), an oligophagous, univoltine species that overwinters as pupae, to determine the geographical variation in postwinter development of pupae with annual and prolonged diapause in geographically isolated populations with various levels of gene flow rates. We tested the hypothesis that emergence patterns within a population (early-vs. late-emerged adults) and local adaptation of populations from different habitats would affect the rate of postwinter development of pupae that yield adults during the first year of diapause. We also hypothesized that postwinter development of pupae with prolonged dormancy would differ among geographical isolated populations with gene flow. Our results revealed that (a) postwinter developmental period of pupae differ among genetic distant populations in the absence of intrapopulation variability in emergence patterns, and (b) temperature exerts a differential effect on postwinter developmental time in populations from both different and similar habitats. Prolonged dormancy seems to minimize population effects on postwinter developmental time. Females finished their postwinter development earlier than males. Population is a significant predictor of postwinter development for R. cerasi pupae with annual diapause but not for those that with a prolonged dormancy schedule.																	0024-4066	1095-8312				JUN 1	2017	121	2					282	293		10.1093/biolinnean/blw042								WOS:000405207800005

Temperature influences the reproduction of fiddler crabs at the southern edge of their distribution	INVERTEBRATE BIOLOGY												Understanding the spatial patterns of reproductive biology might provide predictions about fitness and population stability in different locations within the geographical range of a particular species. Leptuca uruguayensis is a fiddler crab that breeds year round in tropical estuaries but only in summer months in temperate salt marshes. In this study, we examined several reproductive attributes of the southernmost population of L. uruguayensis, including the proportion of ovigerous females, the proportion of surface-active crabs, the developmental status of the gonads and hepatopancreas, and the fullness of seminal receptacles, and related them to environmental factors such as temperature, photoperiod, and sediment organic matter content. We found that temperature was the environmental factor that was most correlated with the reproductive process of the southernmost fiddler crab, since this environmental factor was related to ovarian development, to the fullness of seminal receptacles, and to the hepatosomatic index. At the southern edge of its distribution, the low temperatures of winter restricted reproduction in L. uruguayensis. These winter temperatures might represent the lower limit of the thermal window of this fiddler crab, limiting its extension toward higher latitudes.																	1077-8306	1744-7410				JUN	2017	136	2					171	183		10.1111/ivb.12168								WOS:000404615500005

Cross-latitudinal transplantations support this; many tree species can well adapt to new geographical areas. However, these studies fail to capture species' adaptations to new light environment because the experiments were not designed to explicitly separate species' responses to light and temperature. Here we tested reaction norms of tree seedlings in reciprocal transplantations 1,000km apart from each other at two latitudes (60 degrees N and 69 degrees N). In contrast to past studies, we exposed our experimental plants to same temperature in both sites (temperature of 60 degrees N growing site is recorded to adjust temperature of 69 degrees N site in real time via Internet connection) while light environment (photoperiod, light quality) remained ambient. Shoot elongation and autumn coloration were studied in seedlings of two deciduous trees (Betula pendula and Sorbus aucuparia), which were expected to respond differently to day length. Sorbus as a member of Rosaceae family was assumed to be indifferent to photoperiod, while Betula responds strongly to day length. We hypothesized that (1) southern and northern populations of both species perform differently; (2) southern populations perform better in both sites; (3) autumn phenology of southern populations may delay in the northern site; (4) and Sorbus aucuparia is less dependent on light environment. According to the hypotheses, shoot elongation of northern population was inherently low in both species. An evolutionary consequence of this may be a competitive success of southern populations under warming climate. Southern population of B.pendula was delayed in autumn coloration, but not in growth cessation. Sorbus aucuparia was less responsive to light environment. The results suggest that light provides selection pressure in range shifts, but the response is species dependent.																	2045-7758					JUN	2017	7	12					4507	4517		10.1002/ece3.3026								WOS:000403884700040	28649360

Three populations were selected for the analyses: a managed tree stand, a selected seed stand and a seed orchard. Samples of 200 seeds (4 x 50) were randomly selected. Before scarification, the seeds were stored at -70 A degrees C for 24 h. Nine different scarification treatments were evaluated. To calculate the germination capacity and the dynamics of germination, observations were made on days 3, 5, 7, 10 and 14 after treatment. For statistical analyses, we used repeated measures analysis of variance. The obtained results indicated that the highest scarification efficiency for black locust seeds occurred in the treatment in liquid nitrogen and in an air temperature range of 85-90 A degrees C. The provenance of seeds had a significant effect on the dynamics of germination. Thermal methods and the use of liquid nitrogen can be alternatives to the labour intensive methods of cutting the seeds or using measures that require specialised equipment.																	1612-4669	1612-4677				JUN	2017	136	3					471	479		10.1007/s10342-017-1046-3								WOS:000403722900008

We conducted three experiments, each containing nine treatments (combinations of two of the above three factors, each with three levels). When photoperiod was set at 12L(light):12D(dark), combinations of salinity 70/140 ppt and temperature 19/23 degrees C led most females to produce diapaused offspring (resting eggs / cysts; percentage of diapaused broods being 81.60 +/- 32.51% [mean +/- SD ; same below] to 99.28 +/- 3.48%). Under combinations of salinity 70/140 ppt and 27 degrees C most broods were nauplii (percentage of diapaused broods being 28.46 +/- 30.68% to 38.43 +/- 23.22%). When salinity was set to 70 ppt, treatment conditions of 19/23/27 degrees C + 6L:18D and 19/23 degrees C + 12L:12D induced high percentage of diapaused broods (72.11 +/- 36.42% to 100 +/- 0.00%). When temperature was set to 25 degrees C, overwhelming cyst production was only observed under 6L: 18D + 70/140 ppt (percentage of diapaused broods being 83.33 +/- 23.57% to 93.86 +/- 14.10%). These results suggest that the modes of offspring production in the studied Artemia clone are strongly influenced by photoperiod and temperature and there is significant interaction between the two factors. Lower temperature and shorter daylight tend to induce production of resting eggs, and the effect of photoperiod may dominate over the effect of temperature. Though an interaction between salinity and photoperiod was detected, a sound tendency for the salinity effect could not be determined.																	1584-9074	1842-6441				JUN	2017	13	1					12	17	e161302									WOS:000403914500003

Mechanistic species distribution modeling reveals a niche shift during invasion	ECOLOGY												Niche shifts of nonnative plants can occur when they colonize novel climatic conditions. However, the mechanistic basis for niche shifts during invasion is poorly understood and has rarely been captured within species distribution models. We quantified the consequence of between-population variation in phenology for invasion of common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.) across Europe. Ragweed is of serious concern because of its harmful effects as a crop weed and because of its impact on public health as a major aeroallergen. We developed a forward mechanistic species distribution model based on responses of ragweed development rates to temperature and photoperiod. The model was parameterized and validated from the literature and by reanalyzing data from a reciprocal common garden experiment in which native and invasive populations were grown within and beyond the current invaded range. It could therefore accommodate between-population variation in the physiological requirements for flowering, and predict the potentially invaded ranges of individual populations. Northern-origin populations that were established outside the generally accepted climate envelope of the species had lower thermal requirements for bud development, suggesting local adaptation of phenology had occurred during the invasion. The model predicts that this will extend the potentially invaded range northward and increase the average suitability across Europe by 90% in the current climate and 20% in the future climate. Therefore, trait variation observed at the population scale can trigger a climatic niche shift at the biogeographic scale. For ragweed, earlier flowering phenology in established northern populations could allow the species to spread beyond its current invasive range, substantially increasing its risk to agriculture and public health. Mechanistic species distribution models offer the possibility to represent niche shifts by varying the traits and niche responses of individual populations. Ignoring such effects could substantially underestimate the extent and impact of invasions.

Life history of the harlequin ladybird, Harmonia axyridis: a global meta-analysis	BIOCONTROL												The harlequin ladybird, Harmonia axyridis, is an important natural enemy of aphids throughout the world, but is now also considered an invasive alien species. We performed a meta-analysis of published life history data to address the question whether invading populations in Europe and North America have life history parameters that differ from native populations in Asia, explaining the beetle's invasion success in new territories. In this meta-analysis, we accounted for important covariables that are often reported in published studies such as temperature, food source (aphids or eggs of Ephestia kuehniella), strain (laboratory or field populations) and photoperiod. Temperature was a key factor having consistent large effects on development rate, survival and reproductive characteristics of H. axyridis. Food source, strain, and photoperiod had effects on some, but not all characteristics, and their overall effect across characteristics was minor. Individuals of invasive populations had a shorter pre-oviposition period and higher fecundity at low temperatures than those of native populations, and a greater longevity across all temperatures. No differences in survival were found between native and invasive populations, while differences in development rate were not consistent, with opposing results obtained according to the way development rate was measured in trials reported in the literature. Results of this meta-analysis support the hypothesis that the life history of the beetle has changed during its invasion into North America and Europe. Invasive populations had a shorter pre-oviposition period and higher fecundity at low temperatures, as well as a greater longevity across all temperatures than native populations. These differences may partially explain the invasive success of H. axyridis.				van Lenteren, Joop/J-1748-2014	van Lenteren, Joop/0000-0003-3620-1392; Hemerik, Lia/0000-0002-6892-2840; van der Werf, Wopke/0000-0002-5506-4699												1386-6141	1573-8248				JUN	2017	62	3			SI		283	296		10.1007/s10526-017-9805-0								WOS:000400990600001

Novel microsatellite loci reveal high genetic diversity yet low population structure for alfalfa leafcutting bees in North America	CONSERVATION GENETICS												The alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata (ALCB) is an economically important pollinator necessary for seed production of the critical forage crop alfalfa, Medicago sativa. The pollinator was accidentally introduced to North America from Europe approximately 70 years ago, and it is primarily produced in Canada and shipped to the United States annually en masse for seed field pollination. We investigate how the large-scale commercial movement of this bee affects the genetic structure of populations in the North American seed growing system and compare the genetic diversity and structure of introduced North American bees with two native European populations. Using 16 newly developed microsatellite loci, we describe the North American population structure of this bee. ALCBs collected from alfalfa seed farms have a degree of genetic variability similar to one native European population, but lower than the second. Considering that the species was accidentally introduced into North America, we anticipated more signature of a founder effect. Despite the level of genetic variability, we found little, if any, genetic structuring across North America, other than that the North American populations were distinct from the European populations sampled. While we detected some sub-structure in North American populations using Bayesian methods, the structuring was without geographic pattern, and we propose it is the result of the intense human management and movement of these bees. The trade and movement of these bees by humans has created a nearly panmictic M. rotundata population across the continent, which has implications relevant to the preservation and conservation of other bee pollinators.																	1566-0621	1572-9737				JUN	2017	18	3			SI		679	687		10.1007/s10592-017-0943-9								WOS:000400991800015

Will phenotypic plasticity affecting flowering phenology keep pace with climate change?	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Rising temperatures have begun to shift flowering time, but it is unclear whether phenotypic plasticity can accommodate projected temperature change for this century. Evaluating clines in phenological traits and the extent and variation in plasticity can provide key information on assessing risk of maladaptation and developing strategies to mitigate climate change. In this study, flower phenology was examined in 52 populations of big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) growing in three common gardens. Flowering date (anthesis) varied 91 days from late July to late November among gardens. Mixed-effects modeling explained 79% of variation in flowering date, of which 46% could be assigned to plasticity and genetic variation in plasticity and 33% to genetics (conditional R-2 = 0.79, marginal R-2 = 0.33). Two environmental variables that explained the genetic variation were photoperiod and the onset of spring, the Julian date of accumulating degree-days >5 degrees C reaching 100. The genetic variation was mapped for contemporary and future climates (decades 2060 and 2090), showing flower date change varies considerably across the landscape. Plasticity was estimated to accommodate, on average, a +/- 13-day change in flowering date. However, the examination of genetic variation in plasticity suggests that the magnitude of plasticity could be affected by variation in the sensitivity to photoperiod and temperature. In a warmer common garden, lower-latitude populations have greater plasticity (+16 days) compared to higher-latitude populations (+10 days). Mapped climatypes of flowering date for contemporary and future climates illustrate the wide breadth of plasticity and large geographic overlap. Our research highlights the importance of integrating information on genetic variation, phenotypic plasticity and climatic niche modeling to evaluate plant responses and elucidate vulnerabilities to climate change.																	1354-1013	1365-2486				JUN	2017	23	6					2499	2508		10.1111/gcb.13532								WOS:000400445900031	27739159

Current, widely used methods for long-term measurement of C. elegans are limited by low throughput and the difficulty of performing longitudinal monitoring of aging phenotypes. Here we describe the WorMotel, a microfabricated device for long-term cultivation and automated longitudinal imaging of large numbers of C. elegans confined to individual wells. Using the WorMotel, we find that short-lived and long-lived strains exhibit patterns of behavioral decline that do not temporally scale between individuals or populations, but rather resemble the shortest and longest lived individuals in a wild type population. We also find that behavioral trajectories of worms subject to oxidative stress resemble trajectories observed during aging. Our method is a powerful and scalable tool for analysis of C. elegans behavior and aging.

Weather, day length and physical activity in older adults: Cross-sectional results from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) Norfolk Cohort	PLOS ONE												Background A wide range of environmental factors have been related to active ageing, but few studies have explored the impact of weather and day length on physical activity in older adults. We investigate the cross-sectional association between weather conditions, day length and activity in older adults using a population-based cohort in England, the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) Norfolk study. Methods Physical activity was measured objectively over 7 days using an accelerometer and this was used to calculate daily total physical activity (counts per minute), daily minutes of sedentary behaviour and light, moderate and vigorous physical activity (LMVPA). Day length and two types of weather conditions, precipitation and temperature, were obtained from a local weather station. The association between these variables and physical activity was examined by multilevel first-order autoregressive modelling. Results After adjusting for individual factors, short day length and poor weather conditions, including high precipitation and low temperatures, were associated with up to 10% lower average physical activity (p<0.01) and 8 minutes less time spent in LMVPA but 15 minutes more sedentary time, compared to the best conditions. Conclusion Day length and weather conditions appear to be an important factor related to active ageing. Future work should focus on developing potential interventions to reduce their impact on physical activity behaviours in older adults.																	1932-6203					MAY 31	2017	12	5							e0177767	10.1371/journal.pone.0177767								WOS:000402608700027	28562613

ICAD Collaborators	Weather and children's physical activity; how and why do relationships vary between countries?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY												Background: Globally most children do not engage in enough physical activity. Day length and weather conditions have been identified as determinants of physical activity, although how they may be overcome as barriers is not clear. We aim to examine if and how relationships between children's physical activity and weather and day length vary between countries and identify settings in which children were better able to maintain activity levels given the weather conditions they experienced. Methods: In this repeated measures study, we used data from 23,451 participants in the International Children's Accelerometry Database (ICAD). Daily accelerometer-measured physical activity (counts per minute; cpm) was matched to local weather conditions and the relationships assessed using multilevel regression models. Multilevel models accounted for clustering of days within occasions within children within study-cities, and allowed us to explore if and how the relationships between weather variables and physical activity differ by setting. Results: Increased precipitation and wind speed were associated with decreased cpm while better visibility and more hours of daylight were associated with increased cpm. Models indicated that increases in these variables resulted in average changes in mean cpm of 7.6/h of day length, -13.2/cm precipitation, 10.3/10 km visibility and -10.3/10kph wind speed (all p < 0.01). Temperature showed a cubic relationship with cpm, although between 0 and 20 degrees C the relationship was broadly linear. Age showed interactions with temperature and precipitation, with the associations larger among younger children. In terms of geographic trends, participants from Northern European countries and Melbourne, Australia were the most active, and also better maintained their activity levels given the weather conditions they experienced compared to those in the US and Western Europe. Conclusions: We found variation in the relationship between weather conditions and physical activity between ICAD studies and settings. Children in Northern Europe and Melbourne, Australia were not only more active on average, but also more active given the weather conditions they experienced. Future work should consider strategies to mitigate the impacts of weather conditions, especially among young children, and interventions involving changes to the physical environment should consider how they will operate in different weather conditions.

Despite the wide range of potential functions, the current knowledge regarding BBX proteins in major crop plants is scarce. In this study, we identify and characterize the StBBX gene family in potato, which is composed of 30 members, with regard to structural properties and expression profiles under diurnal cycle, etiolation and de-etiolations. Based on domain organization and phylogenetic relationships, StBBX genes have been classified into five groups. Using real-time quantitative PCR, we found that expression of most of them oscillates following a 24-h rhythm; however, large differences in expression profiles were observed between the genes regarding amplitude and position of the maximal and minimal expression levels in the day/night cycle. On the basis of the time-of-day/time-of-night, we distinguished three expression groups specifically expressed during the light and two during the dark phase. In addition, we showed that the expression of several StBBX genes is under the control of the circadian clock and that some others are specifically associated with the etiolation and de-etiolation conditions. Thus, we concluded that StBBX proteins are likely key players involved in the complex diurnal and circadian networks regulating plant development as a function of light conditions and day duration.																	1932-6203					MAY 26	2017	12	5							e0177471	10.1371/journal.pone.0177471								WOS:000402063000005	28552939

Temperature-dependent regulation of induction into secondary dormancy of Polygonum aviculare L. seeds: A quantitative analysis	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												In seeds of many summer annuals low temperatures under moist conditions provoke dormancy release while high temperatures induce secondary dormancy. Seed dormancy level establishes the range of temperatures under which germination is possible. The range of temperatures permissive for seed germination is determined by two threshold limit temperatures: Lower limit temperature (T-l) and High limit temperature (T-h). Numerous studies have been conducted to characterize the effect of temperature on dormancy release, but there is very few information on how temperature regulates secondary dormancy induction. Seeds of Polygonum aviculare were stratified at 1.6, 5 and 10 degrees C until achieving a minimum dormancy, and then were induced into secondary dormancy by further storage at 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 degrees C. Based on obtained germination time course-curves we quantified changes in the thermal range permissive for seed germination through variations in the mean lower limit temperature for seed germination (Too)) using a mathematical simulation germination model. Our data suggest that induction into secondary dormancy in P. aviculare seeds can be assessed quantitatively through changes in T-l(50). This changes could be described through a Dormancy Induction Thermal-Time Index (DItt), in which thermal time units are accumulated above a threshold temperature from which secondary dormancy is induced (7.9 degrees C). Additionally, the induction-rate into secondary dormancy was affected by the stratification temperature during dormancy release. We conclude that the effect of temperature on the rate of dormancy induction is not only dependent on prevailing temperature, but also on temperature experienced by seeds during previous dormancy release and the resulting dormancy status of the seed population.

Store- operated Ca2+ entry supports contractile function in hearts of hibernators	PLOS ONE												Hibernators have a distinctive ability to adapt to seasonal changes of body temperature in a range between 37 degrees C and near freezing, exhibiting, among other features, a unique reversibility of cardiac contractility. The adaptation of myocardial contractility in hibernation state relies on alterations of excitation contraction coupling, which becomes less-dependent from extracellular Ca2+ entry and is predominantly controlled by Ca2+ release from sarcoplasmic reticulum, replenished by the Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA). We found that the specific SERCA inhibitor cyclopiazonic acid (CPA), in contrast to its effect in papillary muscles (PM) from rat hearts, did not reduce but rather potentiated contractility of PM from hibernating ground squirrels (GS). In GS ventricles we identified drastically elevated, compared to rats, expression of Orai1, Stim1 and Trpc1/3/4/5/6/7 mRNAs, putative components of store operated Ca2+ channels (SOC). Trpc3 protein levels were found increased in winter compared to summer GS, yet levels of Trpc5, Trpc6 or Trpc7 remained unchanged. Under suppressed voltage-dependent K+, Na+ and Ca2+ currents, the SOC inhibitor 2-aminoethyl diphenylborinate (2-APB) diminished whole-cell membrane currents in isolated cardiomyocytes from hibernating GS, but not from rats. During cooling-reheating cycles (30 degrees C-7 degrees C-30 degrees C) of ground squirrel PM, 2-APB did not affect typical CPA-sensitive elevation of contractile force at low temperatures, but precluded the contractility at 30 degrees C before and after the cooling. Wash-out of 2-APB reversed PM contractility to control values. Thus, we suggest that SOC play a pivotal role in governing the ability of hibernator hearts to maintain their function during the transition in and out of hibernating states.																	1932-6203					MAY 22	2017	12	5							e0177469	10.1371/journal.pone.0177469								WOS:000402058400019	28531217

The plant clock is a complex network of transcription factors that regulate each other, forming interlocked feedback loops. Most of its components are light-regulated in some way, making the system highly sensitive to changes in light conditions. Here, we explore the mechanisms by which the plant clock adapts to changing day length. We first present some experimental data illustrating the variety of behaviors found in seedlings exposed to external day/night cycles different from 24 h. We then use a mathematical model to characterize the response of the clock to a wide range of external cycle lengths and photoperiods. We show the existence of several domains of periodic entrainment with different ratios between the external cycle length and the period of the clock, and the presence of quasiperiodic and chaotic behaviors outside of the entrainment range. We simulate knockout mutants with impaired clock function and theoretical variants with diminished light sensitivity to highlight the role of a complex network and multiple light inputs in keeping the clock entrained over a wide range of conditions.																	0022-5193	1095-8541				MAY 7	2017	420						220	231		10.1016/j.jtbi.2017.03.005								WOS:000400952700023	28284990

Grower Analysis of Organic Matter Amendments in California Orchards	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Organic matter amendments supply crop nutrients and enhance soil health, yet information specific to orchards is lacking. A survey was conducted to analyze use of these materials by California almond [Prunus dulcis (Mill.) D. A. Webb] growers. Significant differences were observed for benefits, concerns, and accessibility to manure and green waste sources and between users and nonusers. Use patterns were significantly influenced by heavy and light users, farm size, and geographic region. Enhanced soil biology was the main benefit attributed to organic matter amendments by both users and nonusers. Nonusers showed greater concern for food safety compared to users, and all growers reported greater concern for food safety from manure. The greatest adoption of organic matter amendments occurred on small farms (<= 170 ha) located in the north San Joaquin Valley in California. Greater accessibility to manure correlated with presence of dairy farms. Poorer accessibility ratings by nonusers suggest access is a barrier to adoption, as opposed to nonusers having an undesirable view of the practice. Common management included applying organic matter amendments during tree dormancy from manure sources in composted forms with no- till. Heavy users on small farms exhibited the greatest year- to- year consistency and were more flexible with selection of sources and diverse in application methods. Large farms (> 170 ha) were less likely to use organic matter amendments every year and less likely to apply them on all their farm area. This study identifies a number of strategies to fill knowledge gaps, increase practice awareness, and overcome barriers to adoption.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				MAY-JUN	2017	46	3					649	658		10.2134/jeq2016.11.0456								WOS:000404385100021	28724089

Comparative Evaluation of Development and Reproductive Capacity of Two Biotypes of Lilioceris cheni (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), Biological Control Agents of Air Potato (Dioscorea Bulbifera) in Florida	ANNALS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												A Chinese biotype of Lilioceris cheni Gressitt and Kimoto (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) is being mass reared and released in Florida for biological control of the invasive air potato vine, Dioscorea bulbifera L. (Dioscoreales). Another biotype from Nepal is under investigation for determining whether its release would benefit the ongoing biological control program. We compared temperature-dependent development, fecundity, life table parameters, and consumption of the two biotypes in the laboratory. Both biotypes completed development at 20-30 degrees C, although survival of Chinese beetles was higher at 20 degrees C and 27.5 degrees C, and survival of Nepalese beetles was higher at 30 degrees C. In addition, Nepalese beetles developed at a faster rate at 20 degrees C, and consumed air potato foliage at a higher rate at 25 degrees C. The most important difference between the biotypes, with regard to biological control purposes, was the shorter generation time of Nepalese beetles, which resulted in a higher intrinsic rate of population increase, despite much higher fecundity of Chinese beetles. The higher intrinsic rate of increase of the Nepalese beetles may allow a more rapid population increase in the field, and thus, greater damage to air potato plants. However, differences in other life history traits, such as overwintering ability, diapause, and cold tolerance, will also influence field performance.																	0013-8746	1938-2901				MAY	2017	110	3					310	316		10.1093/aesa/saw100								WOS:000403490400009

The successful spread of this species to higher altitudes and latitudes may be explained by its ability to rapidly induce a heritable low temperature phenotype (cold hardiness in eggs). As a result of the low genetic diversity of founder populations, an epigenetic short-term mechanism has been suggested as the driver of this diversification. We investigated if random epigenetic alterations promoted the cold hardiness of Ae. albopictus eggs from a transgenerational study of two epigenetic agents (genistein and vinclozolin). To this end, we evaluated changes in lethal time for 50% of pharate larvae (Lt(50)) from eggs exposed to -2 degrees C in two subsequent generations that used a new dose-response test design. We detected a significant diversification of the cold hardiness of eggs (up to 64.5%) that was associated with the epigenetic change in the two subsequent offspring generations. An effect size of epigenetically modulated cold hardiness of this magnitude is likely to have an impact on the spatial distribution of this species. Our results provide a framework for further research on epigenetic temperature adaptation of invasive species to better explain and predict their rapid range expansions.

In the present study, we analyze how habitat and soil moisture determine the fate of pupae of the pine processionary moth Thaumetopoea pityocampa, a defoliator pest in pine woodlands of Europe and the Circunmediterranean region. The pine processionary moth pupates buried in the soil and can spend up to 9 years in an extra-long diapause. 2 We considered the impact that different habitats, as well as the manipulation of soil water conditions in the preferred habitat (i.e. in bare ground with null or sparse herbaceous vegetation), can exert on pupation. 3 Less than half of the buried larvae successfully pupated, even in the most favourable habitats and soil water conditions, whereas, on average, 2.5% underwent extra-long pupae diapause (2 years after pupation). 4 Although habitat influenced mainly pupation success and pupal survival, changing moisture conditions in the preferred habitat affected primarily the phenology of emergence, whereas pupal survival remained unaffected. 5 The results of the present study reveal the importance of both habitat and soil moisture on the pupal stage, providing valuable information with respect to adequately forecasting the effects of changes in climate or land use on the population dynamic of this important forest pest.

In a warmer climate, the photoperiod-sensitive life stage can be expected to be reached earlier in the season, when day length is still long, thereby increasing the probability of an additional generation. 2 Populations from four latitudes in Sweden of the tree-killing bark beetle Ips typographus (L.) and its predator Thanasimus formicarius (L.) (Coleoptera, Cleridae) were reared at day lengths from 8 to 23.5 h. Ips typographus adults were classified as being reproductive or in diapause by dissection. Thanasimus formicarius new generation adults were classified as direct developers, whereas last-instar larvae in pupal chambers were classified as in developmental diapause. 3 The frequency of reproductive diapause among new generation I. typographus adults was negatively correlated with day length and positively correlated with latitude of population origin. The two northernmost populations included a considerable proportion of individuals that entered reproductive diapause even at the longest day lengths. By contrast, diapause entry in the predator T. formicarius was generally independent of photoperiod and geographical origin. 4 In awarmer climate, two generations per year may bemore common for I. typographus in Sweden. The predator is less likely to increase voltinism.																	1461-9555	1461-9563				MAY	2017	19	2					146	153		10.1111/afe.12189								WOS:000403024600005

Patterns of habitat use by the Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri, as influenced by abiotic and biotic growing conditions	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST ENTOMOLOGY												1 The Asian citrus psyllid Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae) is an economically important pest of citrus throughout Asia and the Americas because it transmits Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas), which is the presumed causal agent of citrus greening disease. 2 We investigated whether biotic and abiotic characteristics can be used to predict Diaphorina citri population abundance and assessed whether agricultural intensity explained the distribution of D. citri populations during winter dormant periods (December to March). 3 Over two consecutive winters, we examined the abundance of D. citri in groves throughout Florida in response to four different management regimes, defined as: conventional, intermittent, unmanaged and organic. 4 During both years, the winter abundance of D. citri in groves with intermittent management was greater than in groves with other management regimes. Latitude and row orientation both had a significant effect on psyllid density during winter. Diaphorina citri abundance was higher when more than 20% of the surrounding landscape was urbanized. 5 These findings suggest that only conventional management of groves reduced D. citri populations during winter periods. By contrast, intermittent management was associated with higher D. citri populations. These results might be of some concern in light of the economic and environmental costs of repeated insecticide applications and the dramatic decline of citrus production in the U.S.A.																	1461-9555	1461-9563				MAY	2017	19	2					171	180		10.1111/afe.12197								WOS:000403024600008

Euhadra brandtii sapporo is an arboreal land snail distributed in a restricted area of Hokkaido, Japan. We hypothesized that arboreality provides the species with significant survival advantages, which we tested via field observations and experiments. A monitoring census showed that E. b. sapporo hibernates in winter in the ground litter, climbs into the canopy in early spring and returns to the ground in late autumn. This seasonal movement appears to be effective for escaping from predation by ground-dwelling carabine beetles, whose activity was high during the summer based on a pitfall-trap census. Manipulative field experiments were conducted to compare survival rates in arboreal and ground-dwelling environments. We collected 120 E. b. sapporo individuals in summer and tethered 40 in tree canopies and 80 on the ground; half those on the ground were covered by baskets to prevent predation by large animals. The survival rate after 11 days was highest in the canopy, followed by that on the ground with a basket and was lowest on the ground without a basket. Predation was the main cause of death, but some died from other causes. Similar results were obtained in autumn, except for higher survival rates of the ground treatments. Analyses of carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios suggest that the land snail uses epiphytic lichens and mosses as food resources. In conclusion, arboreality has a marked advantage in reducing mortality in E. b. sapporo and is probably supported by food availability as well.

Reliance on Exotic Plants by Two Groups of Threatened Samango Monkeys, Cercopithecus albogularis labiatus, at Their Southern Range Limit	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY												Understanding how threatened species adapt their behavior to landscapes shaped by humans is increasingly important to ensuring they persist in a changing world. Matrix habitats can be shared spaces where human and nonhuman primates coexist. We set out to determine how an endemic, threatened forest specialist, the frugivorous, arboreal samango monkey (Cercopithecus albogularis labiatus), has responded to a matrix habitat made up of residential gardens and commercial plantations in Eastern Cape province, South Africa. We followed two groups from dawn to dusk for a mean of 3 days/mo for 12 mo (February 1, 2011 to January 31, 2012) using scan sampling to collect data on their diet, activity, and ranging patterns. We used resource abundance transects to describe the groups' home ranges and monitored tree phenology to calculate fruit and seed availability indices. Monkeys from both groups consumed large quantities of exotic plant species, accounting for > 50% of their overall annual diet, with seeds of the invasive black wattle (Acacia mearnsii) the most commonly consumed exotic species followed by acorns of two oak species (Quercus robur and Q. palustris.). However, monkeys responded to the availability of indigenous rather than exotic fruits and seeds and increased their consumption of exotics when indigenous fruits were less available. Although monkeys spent less time moving when feeding on exotic species compared to indigenous species, eating exotics did not free up monkeys' time to rest or socialize, as additional time was required to process exotic foods. To offset the possible negative consequences of the monkeys' reliance on exotic seeds, including escalating conflict between monkeys and people in gardens, we suggest gradual removal of exotic plant species in the habitat and replacement with indigenous species as one mitigation strategy.

F.; Archibald, Sally			Assessing the frequency and drivers of early-greening in broad-leaved woodlands along a latitudinal gradient in southern Africa	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												Savannas are the only deciduous system where new leaf flush pre-empts the onset of suitable conditions for growth, a phenological phenomenon known as early-greening. Limited understanding of the frequency and drivers of the occurrence of early-greening in southern African savanna trees exists. We aimed to estimate the frequency of early-greening events across southern Africa and investigated potential environmental drivers of green-up. We selected and compared seven broad-leaved woodland sites where Burkea africana was a dominant species using remotely sensed data along a latitudinal gradient from South Africa to Zambia. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values were extracted from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery at each site from January 2002 to June 2014. Using an austral year (July 1st-June 30th), early-greening was recorded if the green-up start date occurred prior to the onset date of seasonal rainfall. A latitudinal gradient of early-green-up was detected across southern Africa (R-2 = 0.74) with the two most northerly (Zambian) sites showing the earliest and most consistent green-up start dates (3 October +/- 5.34days). A strong latitudinal gradient was observed between the variability in the amount of rainfall in the first 6months of green-up and the green-up start dates across southern Africa (R-2 = 0.92). Photoperiod appeared to play a role in areas where the onset of rainfall commenced late into the austral year. Mean maximum temperatures recorded 10days prior to green-up start dates suggested a potential threshold of about 35 degrees C, which could drive early-greening in the absence of rainfall. Correlations between the proportion of early-greening years and the above mentioned environmental factors indicated that rainfall variability had the strongest influence over the observed phenological gradient (R-2 = 0.96). Understanding early-greening in complex savanna systems is a vital step in furthering predictive phenological models under changing climatic conditions.

In the first year, the effect of photoperiod was assessed using fluorescent lamps (FLs) at 16L:8D, 13L:11D, 11L:13D and 8L:16D. In the second year, the effect of light quality was assessed by producing the 16L:8D photoperiod with FLs, high pressure sodium lamps (HPSLs) and HPSLs complemented with red (R) light emitting diodes (LEDs) (11 + 5 h, HPSLs + R). In the third year, 16L:8D, 11L:13D, 8L:16D photoperiods were produced by HPSLs and 16L:8D with FLs. In all the treatments, females from the first, second and third generation oviposited, and their eggs hatched pointing that M. pygmaeus does not undergo reproductive diapause. In general, shorter photoperiods prolonged the development time of immatures regardless the light source, whereas fecundity increased with decreasing photoperiod irrespectively of light quality. In FLs, fecundity was significantly lower than in HPSLs alone or in HPSLs + R in one experiment, whereas light quality (FLs and HPSLs) did not affect fecundity in the other experiment. The results suggest that HPSLs as such do not adversely affect reproductive biology of the bug except for the pre-adult development time, and that part of the long photoperiod could be replaced with red LEDs without negatively affecting the bug's biology. The 16-h light period produced by artificial lighting in year-round tomato production, however, is not optimal for the fecundity of M. pygmaeus, and fertility may also decrease. Further research is needed from greenhouse winter conditions where the bugs perceive and may respond also to the natural short photoperiod. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Winter sleep with room service: denning behaviour of brown bears with access to anthropogenic food	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Large quantities of food subsidies provided by humans to animal communities have the potential to change a variety of animal life traits, including denning behaviour of facultative hibernators like bears. Brown bears Ursus arctos regularly use anthropogenic food, but it has remained unclear if human food subsidies affect their hibernation and denning behaviour, despite the consequences this could have for bear interactions with humans and other species. We studied denning behaviour of European brown bears in Slovenia, where intensive supplemental feeding with corn is practiced throughout the year, including winter. We used GPS telemetry data to locate den sites and to monitor bear denning chronology. We conducted a meta-analysis to compare our results with other bear populations across Europe, Asia and North America. A consistent relationship between latitude and time spent denning was observed for male and female brown bears across the species' range (for each degree of latitude northwards, denning period increased for 3.1 days), and males on average denned 10.3 days longer than females throughout the latitudinal gradient. However, our study area deviated strongly from regions where supplemental feeding was not practiced. In Slovenia, denning period averaged 82 days for females and 57 days for males, which was 45 and 56% shorter compared to the time predicted for this latitude, respectively. We also observed regular den abandonments (61% of bears abandoned dens, on average 1.9 times per winter). During the winter period bears increased use of supplemental feeding sites for 61% compared to the non-denning period. We conclude that the availability of anthropogenic food is an important driver of denning behaviour in brown bears. Reduction in the denning period increases the potential for bear interactions with other species, including humans, and we highlight possible management and ecological implications of this human-caused perturbation to denning behaviour of wild ursids.

This situation is problematic for inhabitants of temporary waters whose reproductive success depends on rainfall and evaporation that determine the length of the aquatic phase. For organisms with long-lived dormant life stages, bet hedging models suggest that a fraction of these should stay dormant during each growing season to buffer against the probability of total reproductive failure in variable environments. Thus far, however, little empirical evidence supports this prediction in aquatic organisms. We study geographic variation in delayed hatching of dormant eggs in natural populations of two crustaceans, Branchinella longirostris and Paralimnadia badia, that occur in temporary rock pools along a 725 km latitudinal aridity gradient in Western Australia. Consistent with bet hedging theory, populations of both species were characterised by delayed hatching under common garden conditions and hatching fractions decreased towards the drier end of the gradient where the probability of reproductive success was shown to be lower. This decrease was most pronounced in the species with the longer maturation time, presumably because it is more sensitive to the higher prevalence of short inundations. Overall, these findings illustrate that regional variation in climate can be reflected in differential investment in bet hedging and hints at a higher importance of delayed hatching to persist when the climate becomes harsher. Such strategies could become exceedingly relevant as determinants of vulnerability under climate change.																	0029-8549	1432-1939				MAY	2017	184	1					161	170		10.1007/s00442-017-3858-8								WOS:000400369200013	28342010

Here, we present a new model of TE co-option, in which a TE is harnessed by an essential gene and confers local adaptation through heterozygote advantage. We characterized a human Alu-like TE family, the Lm1 elements, in the genome of the migratory locust Locusta migratoria that harbors 0.7 million copies of the elements. Scanning Lm1 insertions in the natural locust populations revealed the widespread high polymorphism of Lm1. An Lm1 was recruited into the coding region of Heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90), an important molecular chaperone for diverse signal transduction and developmental pathways. Only heterozygotes of the allele are present in natural populations. Allele frequency increases with decreased latitudes in east coastal China, even increasing up to 76% in southern populations. Regions flanking the Lm1 insertion display clear signatures of a selective sweep linked to Lm1. The Lm1-mediated Hsp90 mutation is consequential for the embryonic development of locust. Heterozygous embryos develop faster than the wild type, particularly when cued by long-day parental photoperiod. The heterozygotes also present a reduced within-population variation in embryonic development, i.e., high developmental synchrony of embryos. The naturally occurring Hsp90 mutation could facilitate multivoltinism and developmental synchronization of the locust in southern tropical region. These results revealed a genetic mechanism behind microevolutionary changes in which balancing selection may have acted to maintain the heterozygote advantage through TE co-option in essential genes.																	0737-4038	1537-1719				MAY	2017	34	5					1127	1139		10.1093/molbev/msx062								WOS:000399373300008	28138075

Waking Up Buried Memories of Old TV Programs	FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE												Although it has been demonstrated that visual and auditory stimuli can be recalled decades after the initial exposure, previous studies have generally not ruled out the possibility that the material may have been seen or heard during the intervening period. Evidence shows that reactivations of a long-term memory trace play a role in its update and maintenance. In the case of remote or very long-term memories, it is most likely that these reactivations are triggered by the actual re-exposure to the stimulus. In this study we decided to explore whether it is possible to recall stimuli that could not have been re-experienced in the intervening period. We tested the ability of French participants ( N = 34, 31 female) to recall 50 TV programs broadcast on average for the last time 44 years ago (fromthe 60's and early 70's). Potential recall was elicited by the presentation of short audiovisual excerpts of these TV programs. The absence of potential re-exposure to the material was strictly controlled by selecting TV programs that have never been rebroadcast and were not available in the public domain. Our results show that six TV programs were particularly well identified on average across the 34 participants with a median percentage of 71.7% ( SD = 13.6, range: 48.5-87.9%). We also obtained 50 single case reports with associated information about the viewing of 23 TV programs including the 6 previous ones. More strikingly, for two cases, retrieval of the title was made spontaneously without the need of a four-proposition choice. These results suggest that re-exposures to the stimuli are not necessary to maintain a memory for a lifetime. These new findings raise fundamental questions about the underlying mechanisms used by the brain to store these very old sensory memories.																	1662-5153					APR 10	2017	11								60	10.3389/fnbeh.2017.00060								WOS:000398712300001	28443005

SPATIOTEMPORAL ECOLOGY OF APALONE SPINIFERA IN A LARGE, GREAT PLAINS RIVER ECOSYSTEM	HERPETOLOGICAL CONSERVATION AND BIOLOGY												Sparse information exists about the ecology of Spiny Softshell Turtles (Apalone spinifera) in large rivers, at the northwestern extent of their natural range, and in Montana, where they are disjunct from downstream populations and a State Species of Concern. We determined spatiotemporal ecology of 47 female and 12 male turtles from 2009 through 2012 and identified fundamental habitats in the Missouri River in east-central Montana. Movement rates of females were greater than those of males and peaked before nesting. Movement rates of males peaked before overwintering, and movement rates of both sexes were minimal in winter. Home range sizes were not different between sexes, varied among individuals and seasons, and were similar to those reported elsewhere in their northern range. Turtles aggregated and showed interannual fidelity to separate and disparate habitats in different seasons. Turtles often chose fine substrates, tributary confluences, and reaches with islands during summer and mainstem outside bends in the winter. They inhabited shallow, slow water velocity areas from May to September. They inhabited deeper, moderate velocity areas from October to April. We did not observe ice jams and associated riverbed scour at hibernacula, but did observe them elsewhere. Ice jams may be spatially predictable and influence the distribution of riverine turtles during autumn and winter. Preservation of dissimilar habitats used during major portions of the life cycle (lateral habitats, islands, and hibernacula) and natural streamflow patterns, which influenced timing of habitat availability and turtle movement, may facilitate continued existence of Spiny Softshell Turtles in the Missouri River in Montana.																	2151-0733	1931-7603				APR	2017	12	1					252	271										WOS:000402461600025

The aim of this study was to clarify the life-cycle of P. aubei in Hungary, representing populations in the range of invasion, and to compare preferences towards some popular cultivars of Thuja and Juniper ornamental trees. In order to reveal which is the pioneering gender, and to confirm females' preferences between healthy and broken trunks behavioral tests were conducted. Results showed that adults prepare hibernation tunnels from August until October. Sex ratio of overwintering adults was nearly equal. The significantly highest number of hibernation tunnels was found on Thuja plicata Atrovirens (mean +/- S.E.: 6.0 +/- 0.7/tree), followed by T. occidentalis Smaragd (2.2 +/- 0.8), Juniperus chinensis Spartan (1.6 +/- 0.6), and J. scopulorum Blue Arrow (0.2 +/- 0.2). Nuptial chambers were made from April until June, by singly females, never by males. Females chose broken, drying trunks over healthy ones. Adults of the next generation emerged from the galleries from August until October. By October adults emerged from 94% of the galleries, and larvae were found only in 6% of the galleries. These results showed that the autumn flight of P. aubei is linked to making hibernation tunnels, while the spring flight to producing nuptial chambers. The latter corresponds to a single reproductive period per year. Control measures against adults should be timed to these two specific periods of the season.																	0334-2123	1876-7184				APR	2017	45	2					201	210		10.1007/s12600-017-0585-y								WOS:000402153700009

NEW GEOGRAPHIC RECORDS FOR THE NEARCTIC PSYLLID BACTERICERA MACULIPENNIS (CRAWFORD) WITH BIOLOGICAL NOTES AND DESCRIPTIONS OF THE EGG AND FIFTH-INSTAR NYMPH (HEMIPTERA: PSYLLOIDEA: TRIOZIDAE)	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF WASHINGTON												The Nearctic psyllid Bactericera maculipennis (Crawford) (Hemiptera: Psylloidea: Triozidae) is one of only five known species of Psylloidea worldwide whose host plants include species of Convolvulaceae (Solanales). Current checklists of North American Psylloidea report B. maculipennis only from California and Utah. Our surveys of field bindweed, Convolvulus arvensis L. (Convolvulaceae), an OldWorld plant introduced into North America, show that B. maculipennis is considerably more widespread than indicated by historical accounts. We update the psyllid's geographic range to include four states (Washington, Idaho, Oregon, Montana) not previously included in contemporary checklists. The egg and fifth instar nymph are described. We provide characters of the egg and nymph that distinguish this species from a congeneric species, Bactericera cockerelli (Sulc), occasionally found on field bindweed. Photographs of the male and female terminalia are provided. Bactericera maculipennis developed successfully on field bindweed and on several species of Ipomoea (Convolvulaceae) in laboratory assays. Overwintering females collected from leaf litter and dead or dormant stems of C. arvensis at locations in Central Washington mated and began to oviposit within 7 days of removal from the field, suggesting that B. maculipennis overwinters in a temperature-controlled quiescence rather than in a true reproductive diapause. Eggs and nymphs of B. maculipennis were found on stems of C. arvensis well into November in Central Washington, suggesting that this psyllid also may overwinter in pre-adult stages, as indicated by literature accounts from the 1940s and 1950s. Lastly, we propose that successful colonization of the invasive and exotic weed C. arvensis by B. maculipennis has allowed the psyllid to expand its geographic range well beyond historical boundaries. This conclusion is based upon the scarcity of native Convolvulaceae within regions in which the psyllid is newly recorded, combined with the now extensive distribution of the invasive C. arvensis in North America.																	0013-8797					APR	2017	119	2					191	214		10.4289/0013-8797.119.2.191								WOS:000401934500002

Trichogramma dendrolimi Matsumura is mass-reared for biocontrol purposes in several countries around the world. Here we investigated the rate of diapause induction in three populations of T. dendrolimi from different regions in China: Heilongjiang (44 degrees 55' N, 128 degrees 26' E; HLJ), Liaoning (40 degrees 18' N, 123 degrees 22' E; LN), and Jiangsu province (32 degrees 30' N, 120 degrees 09' E; JS). We measured the rates of diapause induction for populations from each region when exposed to temperatures of 8, 10, 12, and 14 degrees C, for periods ranging from 5 to 35 d. Results showed that both the temperature and exposure duration influenced diapause induction in the three populations of T. dendrolimi. The HLJ and LN populations showed the highest percentage of diapause under 12 and 10 degrees C, regardless of time period tested. After 20 d at 12 and 10 degrees C, 97.42% and 95.94% of individuals of HLJ and LN, respectively, entered diapause. After treatment for 20-35 d under 8 degrees C, or 15-25 d under 10 degrees C, the diapause rate of LN was higher than those of the other two populations. In contrast, the higher temperatures (1214 degrees C) induced diapause rapidly and steadily in HLJ. The diapause rate of JS was low for all temperatures and time periods. After 30 d at 12 degrees C, the JS population reached its highest diapause rate (29.56%). Our results showed significant variance in diapause rates among geographically distinct populations of T. dendrolimi in response to various abiotic conditions.																	0022-0493	1938-291X				APR	2017	110	2					386	391		10.1093/jee/tow316								WOS:000401468700009	28334137

Juvenile hormone titers, ovarian status and epicuticular hydrocarbons in gynes and workers of the paper wasp Belonogaster longitarsus	JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY												The prevailing paradigm for social wasp endocrinology is that of juvenile hormone (JH) functioning pleiotropically in potential and actual queens, where it fuels dominance behaviors, stimulates ovarian growth and/or affects the production of status-linked cuticular compounds. In colonies with annual cycles (e.g., temperate-zone species), female adults produced at the end of the summer (called gynes) are physiologically primed to hibernate. Despite the absence of egg-laying in the pre-overwintering phase, gynes engage in dominance interactions that may affect reproductive potential following hibernation. JH levels have long been inferred to be low in gynes but this has never been tested. In what is the first study to measure JH in gyne-containing colonies of a temperate paper wasp, and the first to incorporate hormone assays in Belonogaster, our results show that the JH titer positively correlates with gynespecific traits (including oocyte length and a low frequency of foraging trips) in B. longitarsus, a South African paper wasp. Measures of dominance correlated with oocyte length, but not all dominant females possessed activated ovaries. The cuticular hydrocarbon profiles of gynes and workers were distinct, with oocyte length and JH titer showing a positive association with longer-chain methyl-branched alkanes. Nonetheless, evidence for a role of JH in dominance was inconclusive. Finally, the range of JH titers among gynes, and the positive association of JH titers with ovarian status and prospective fertility signals, makes it unlikely that the gyne phenotype is maintained by low JH levels.

Diapause may represent a recent (<15 Ky) adaptation to the colonisation of temperate Europe by D. melanogaster from tropical sub-Saharan Africa, because African D. melanogaster and the sibling species D. simulans, have been reported to fail to undergo diapause. Over the past few centuries, D. melanogaster have also invaded North America and Australia, and eastern populations on both continents show a predictable latitudinal dine in diapause induction. In Europe however, a new diapause-enhancing timeless allele, ls-tim, is observed at high levels in southern Italy (similar to 80%), where it appears to have arisen and has spread throughout the continent with a frequency of similar to 20% in Scandinavia. Given the phenotype of Is-tim and its geographical distribution, we might predict that it would work against any latitudinal dine in diapause induction within Europe. Indeed we reveal that any latitudinal dine for diapause in Europe is very weak, as predicted by Is-tim frequencies. In contrast, we determine Is-tim frequencies in North America and observe that they would be expected to strengthen the latitudinal pattern of diapause. Our results reveal how a newly arisen mutation, can, via the stochastic nature of where it initially arose, blur an otherwise adaptive geographical pattern. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Data loggers in artificial eggs reveal that egg-turning behavior varies on multiple ecological scales in seabirds	AUK												In most avian species, egg-turning behavior during incubation is vital for proper embryonic development and hatching success. However, changes in turning behaviors are rarely studied across different temporal scales (e.g., day-night or across incubation phases), though the timing of incubation behaviors affects reproductive success. We used data loggers encapsulated in artificial eggs to measure turning rates and angle changes of eggs in Western Gull (Larus occidentalis) and Laysan Albatross (Phoebastria immutabilis) nests. We examined diurnal and daily cycles in egg-turning behaviors across early, middle, and late incubation phases. Our results indicate that (1) egg-turning behaviors remain similar throughout incubation, resulting in a consistent environment for developing chicks; (2) egg-turning rates and angle changes vary according to diurnal cycles and day length in each species; and (3) egg-turning rates, but not angle changes, were similar between species. Egg-turning behaviors may vary among species according to seasonality and geography, and using consistent methodologies to measure egg turning will further clarify the role of egg turning in avian life history and ecology.

Cold tolerance of Trissolcus japonicus and T. cultratus, potential biological control agents of Halyomorpha halys, the brown marmorated stink bug	BIOLOGICAL CONTROL												Halyomorpha halys (Stal) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) is native to Asia and has become a severe agricultural and nuisance pest in the U. S. Therefore, foreign exploration was conducted in Asia to identify potential classical biological control agents. Several Trissolcus spp. (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae) parasitize H. halys eggs in Asia and are being evaluated for potential release in the U. S. Since H. halys has invaded regions that experience sub-zero winter temperatures, cold tolerance is important for evaluation of Trissolcus spp. Our study compared the cold tolerance of populations of T. japonicus and T. cultratus, in order to assess relative suitability of the populations for release. We used thermocouple thermometry to determine the supercooling point and lower lethal temperature after brief exposure to cold temperature for each population. In addition, we subjected adult T. japonicus to a short photoperiod and low temperature regime, which increases cold tolerance in H. halys, to observe whether these conditions cause a change in cold tolerance in the parasitoid. We found that populations of both species froze and survived at colder temperatures than those reported for H. halys. In addition, there were no ecologically relevant differences in the temperature at which freezing or survival occurred among populations of either species, indicating that these populations are equally cold tolerant and suitable for introduction. Finally, T. japonicus does not acclimate by increasing cold tolerance in response to conditions that increase cold tolerance in H. halys, suggesting that the above-mentioned measures of cold tolerance are ecologically relevant.

Climate adaptation is not enough: warming does not facilitate success of southern tundra plant populations in the high Arctic	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Rapidly rising temperatures are expected to cause latitudinal and elevational range shifts as species track their optimal climate north and upward. However, a lack of adaptation to environmental conditions other than climate - for example photoperiod, biotic interactions, or edaphic conditions - might limit the success of immigrants in a new location despite hospitable climatic conditions. Here, we present one of the first direct experimental tests of the hypothesis that warmer temperatures at northern latitudes will confer a fitness advantage to southern immigrants relative to native populations. As rates of warming in the Arctic are more than double the global average, understanding the impacts of warming in Arctic ecosystems is especially urgent. We established experimentally warmed and non-warmed common garden plots at Alexandra Fiord, Ellesmere Island in the Canadian High Arctic with seeds of two forb species (Oxyria digyna and Papaver radicatum) originating from three to five populations at different latitudes across the Arctic. We found that plants from the local populations generally had higher survival and obtained a greater maximum size than foreign individuals, regardless of warming treatment. Phenological traits varied with latitude of the source population, such that southern populations demonstrated substantially delayed leaf-out and senescence relative to northern populations. Our results suggest that environmental conditions other than temperature may influence the ability of foreign populations and species to establish at more northerly latitudes as the climate warms, potentially leading to lags in northward range shifts for some species.

Mechanistic model for predicting the seasonal abundance of Culicoides biting midges and the impacts of insecticide control	PARASITES & VECTORS												Background: Understanding seasonal patterns of abundance of insect vectors is important for optimisation of control strategies of vector-borne diseases. Environmental drivers such as temperature, humidity and photoperiod influence vector abundance, but it is not generally known how these drivers combine to affect seasonal population dynamics. Methods: In this paper, we derive and analyse a novel mechanistic stage-structured simulation model for Culicoides biting midges-the principle vectors of bluetongue and Schmallenberg viruses which cause mortality and morbidity in livestock and impact trade. We model variable life-history traits as functional forms that are dependent on environmental drivers, including air temperature, soil temperature and photoperiod. The model is fitted to Obsoletus group adult suction-trap data sampled daily at five locations throughout the UK for 2008. Results: The model predicts population dynamics that closely resemble UK field observations, including the characteristic biannual peaks of adult abundance. Using the model, we then investigate the effects of insecticide control, showing that control strategies focussing on the autumn peak of adult midge abundance have the highest impact in terms of population reduction in the autumn and averaged over the year. Conversely, control during the spring peak of adult abundance leads to adverse increases in adult abundance in the autumn peak. Conclusions: The mechanisms of the biannual peaks of adult abundance, which are important features of midge seasonality in northern Europe and are key determinants of the risk of establishment and spread of midge-borne diseases, have been hypothesised over for many years. Our model suggests that the peaks correspond to two generations per year (bivoltine) are largely determined by pre-adult development. Furthermore, control strategies should focus on reducing the autumn peak since the immature stages are released from density-dependence regulation. We conclude that more extensive modelling of Culicoides biting midge populations in different geographical contexts will help to optimise control strategies and predictions of disease outbreaks.

Dimorphic cocoons of the cecropia moth (Hyalophora cecropia): Morphological, behavioral, and biophysical differences	PLOS ONE												The larvae of the giant silk moth (Hyalophora cecropia) spin strikingly dimorphic, multilayered cocoons that are either large and fluffy (baggy) or significantly smaller and tightly woven (compact). Although these cocoon-morphs share the same function (i.e., housing for pupal to adult development during overwintering), previous work has been unable to determine why cocoon dimorphism exists. We addressed this issue in cecropia moth cocoons collected along power line right-of-way habitats in Massachusetts. We first characterized the architectural differences between cocoon-morphs for all three cocoon sections (outer and inner envelopes, and the intermediate layer separating the two). We show that outer envelope structural and ultrastructural differences are what underlie dimorphism. Using a common spinning arena, we next show that the behavioral suites used to construct the outer envelopes of the two morphs are significantly different in behavioral time investment and patterning, as well as in the location of silk placement in the common spinning arena. Finally, we compared the cocoon-morphs in response to various environmental stressors to ask whether dimorphism is an adaptive response to such pressures. In contrast to compact cocoons, we find that baggy cocoons act as heat sinks and allow greater moisture permeability; differences in outer envelope architecture underlie these characteristics. These two biophysical properties could be advantageous for pupae in baggy cocoons, during unseasonably cold or dry conditions encountered during development prior to adult emergence. Our results suggest that cocoon dimorphism in the cecropia moth may provide a bet-hedging strategy for dealing with varying environmental conditions in Massachusetts and perhaps over its entire habitat range, during pupal to adult development.																	1932-6203					MAR 22	2017	12	3							e174023	10.1371/journal.pone.0174023								WOS:000399094700043	28329006

The predatory mite Phytoseius plumifer Canestrini & Fanzago is a phytoseiid mite on fig that can feed and reproduce on E. hirsti. The effect of four constant temperatures (20, 25, 30 and 35 degrees C) on demographic parameters of P. plumifer fed on nymphal stages of E. hirsti was determined under laboratory conditions at 50 +/- 5% RH and a photoperiod of 16: 8 h (L: D). The total developmental time of immature stages of this predator decreased with increasing temperature from 20 degrees C to 35 degrees C, and varied from 17.13 +/- 0.23 to 6.55 +/- 0.19 days for females. The lower temperature threshold (T min) and thermal constant (K) for the total immature stages of this predator was estimated 10.33 degrees C and 166.67 degree-days by the ordinary linear model, 11.17 degrees C and 147.87 degree-days by the Ikemoto linear model, respectively. Female longevity was 67.79, 47.00, 35.11, and 27.42 days at 20, 25, 30 and 35 degrees C, respectively. The highest values of total fecundity and daily fecundity were obtained at 25 degrees C (35.71 +/- 1.73 eggs) and 30 degrees C (1.57 +/- 0.02 eggs), respectively. The value of the intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)) increased as increasing temperature from 20 degrees C (0.064 +/- 0.0012 day-1) to 30 degrees C (0.180 +/- 0.0023 day-1), and then decreased at 35 degrees C (0.153 +/- 0.0037 day-1). The highest and lowest values of the mean generation time (T) were 32.75 +/- 0.95 and 14.18 +/- 0.51 days, which were obtained at 20 degrees C and 35 degrees C, respectively. The results of this study revealed that of P. plumifer is effective predator of the fig spider mite and develops effectively at a broad range of temperatures.																	1362-1971					MAR	2017	22	3					410	422		10.11158/saa.22.3.7								WOS:000399665700007

Independent introductions and admixtures have contributed to adaptation of European maize and its American counterparts	PLOS GENETICS												Through the local selection of landraces, humans have guided the adaptation of crops to a vast range of climatic and ecological conditions. This is particularly true of maize, which was domesticated in a restricted area of Mexico but now displays one of the broadest cultivated ranges worldwide. Here, we sequenced 67 genomes with an average sequencing depth of 18x to document routes of introduction, admixture and selective history of European maize and its American counterparts. To avoid the confounding effects of recent breeding, we targeted germplasm (lines) directly derived from landraces. Among our lines, we discovered 22,294,769 SNPs and between 0.9% to 4.1% residual heterozygosity. Using a segmentation method, we identified 6,978 segments of unexpectedly high rate of heterozygosity. These segments point to genes potentially involved in inbreeding depression, and to a lesser extent to the presence of structural variants. Genetic structuring and inferences of historical splits revealed 5 genetic groups and two independent European introductions, with modest bottleneck signatures. Our results further revealed admixtures between distinct sources that have contributed to the establishment of 3 groups at intermediate latitudes in North America and Europe. We combined differentiation-and diversity-based statistics to identify both genes and gene networks displaying strong signals of selection. These include genes/ gene networks involved in flowering time, drought and cold tolerance, plant defense and starch properties. Overall, our results provide novel insights into the evolutionary history of European maize and highlight a major role of admixture in environmental adaptation, paralleling recent findings in humans.

Den selection by barren-ground grizzly bears, Mackenzie Delta, Northwest Territories	POLAR BIOLOGY												Animals living in highly seasonal environments such as the Arctic must cope with periods of reduced resource availability. During periods of food shortage, some resident mammals hibernate and rely on energy stores to overwinter. To conserve energy, hibernating grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) excavate dens that provide thermal insulation and safety. To determine the distribution and habitat characteristics used by grizzly bears for denning in the Mackenzie Delta, Northwest Territories, Canada, we used kernel density and resource selection function analyses based on 624 den locations collected in 1972-2014. We found that grizzly bear dens were broadly distributed with varying densities over the landscape. Our analyses showed that bears selected den sites with aquatic bed and low shrub land cover, with soil types composed of sand- , gravel- , and glacier-deposited rock, and southeastern- , southwestern- , and northern-facing slopes. Grizzly bears also selected for areas with sloped terrain. Open spruce forest was avoided. Information on grizzly bear denning habitat could be used to inform human land use planning and minimize human-bear conflicts.

Response of Northern Bobwhite Movements to Management-Driven Disturbance in a Shrub-Dominated Ecosystem	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT												Despite inhabiting fire-adapted grasslands and shrublands across much of their continental distribution, northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus, hereafter bobwhite) behavior relative to disturbance (e.g., fire) is poorly understood, especially in the western fringe of their distribution. We assessed bobwhite movement and space use following dormant season burning (January-March 2013-2014) in a sand shinnery oak (Quercus havardii, hereafter shinnery oak) plant community. We captured and radio-marked bobwhites (n = 369) and monitored them via radiotelemetry across burn treatments (averaging 254 ha) ranging from 0 to 12, 13 to 24, 25 to 36, and > 36 months post fire (hereafter, time since fire [TSF]) at the Packsaddle Wildlife Management Area in western Oklahoma, United States. Mean covey home range size was 76.6 ha +/- 5.9 [SE] (range; 12 - 270 ha) (n = 61 coveys), which is substantially larger than covey home ranges reported for other regions. Prescribed fire affected space use of coveys (F-4,F- 54 = 2.95, P < 0.05), which was driven by smaller home range sizes of coveys using 25 - 36 TSF (52.07 ha [+/- 6.6]) than 0 - 12 (85.0 ha [+/- 15.53]), 13 - 24 (86.7 ha [+/- 20.7]) and > 36 TSF (78.9 ha [+/- 6.54]). Generalized linear mixed models demonstrated that neither spring dispersal (movements or area traversed) were correlated with TSF, age, or sex (n = 114), further demonstrating a minimal effect of prescribed fire; however, dispersal areas were greater in 2013 than in 2014 (P < 0.05). Our research shows that prescribed fire applied at a landscape scale had limited effects on short-term bobwhite movement and space use. These findings also suggest that in shinnery oak vegetation communities land managers can use prescribed fire across large spatial extents without substantially altering the space use or movement of bobwhites.

This pattern should be more pronounced in tropical than in temperate species as protective mechanisms against chilling injuries are expected to be more effective in the latter. We initially determined the lower thermal thresholds to induce ovarian maturation in four closely related Drosophila species, two inhabiting temperate regions and the other two tropical areas of South America. As expected, only temperate species regularly experience cold-inducing conditions for reproductive arrest during winter in their natural environment. Subsequently, we exposed reproductively arrested and mature females to cold-inducing conditions for reproductive arrest over a long period. Following cold exposure, tropical species exhibited a dramatic fertility decline, irrespective of reproductive status. In contrast, not only were temperate females fecund and fertile but also fertility was superior in females that underwent cold-induced reproductive arrest, suggesting that it might act as a protecting mechanism ensuring fertility after cold recovery. Based on these findings, we decided to evaluate the extent to which reproductive status affects cold tolerance and energy metabolism at low temperature. We found a lower metabolic rate and a higher cold tolerance in reproductively arrested females, although only temperate species attained high levels of chill tolerance. These findings highlight the role of cold-induced reproductive arrest as part of an integrated mechanism of cold adaptation that could potentially contribute to the spread of temperate species into higher latitudes or altitudes.

Because many aspects of ectotherm life history are climate-dependent, geographic variation in climate is expected to have a large impact on population dynamics through effects on annual survival, body size, growth rate, age at first reproduction, size-fecundity relationship, and reproductive frequency. The Eastern Massasauga (Sistrurus catenatus) is a small, imperiled North American rattlesnake with a distribution centered on the Great Lakes region, where lake effects strongly influence local conditions. To address Eastern Massasauga life history data gaps, we compiled data from 47 study sites representing 38 counties across the range. We used multimodel inference and general linear models with geographic coordinates and annual climate normals as explanatory variables to clarify patterns of variation in life history traits. We found strong evidence for geographic variation in six of nine life history variables. Adult female snout-vent length and neonate mass increased with increasing mean annual precipitation. Litter size decreased with increasing mean temperature, and the size-fecundity relationship and growth prior to first hibernation both increased with increasing latitude. The proportion of gravid females also increased with increasing latitude, but this relationship may be the result of geographically varying detection bias. Our results provide insights into ectotherm life history variation and fill critical data gaps, which will inform Eastern Massasauga conservation efforts by improving biological realism for models of population viability and climate change.																	1932-6203					FEB 14	2017	12	2							e0172011	10.1371/journal.pone.0172011								WOS:000394423900043	28196149					
J	Chetri, M; Odden, M; Wegge, P				Chetri, Madhu; Odden, Morten; Wegge, Per			Snow Leopard and Himalayan Wolf: Food Habits and Prey Selection in the Central Himalayas, Nepal	PLOS ONE												Top carnivores play an important role in maintaining energy flow and functioning of the ecosystem, and a clear understanding of their diets and foraging strategies is essential for developing effective conservation strategies. In this paper, we compared diets and prey selection of snow leopards and wolves based on analyses of genotyped scats (snow leopards n = 182, wolves n = 57), collected within 26 sampling grid cells (5x5 km) that were distributed across a vast landscape of ca 5000 km(2) in the Central Himalayas, Nepal. Within the grid cells, we sampled prey abundances using the double observer method. We found that interspecific differences in diet composition and prey selection reflected their respective habitat preferences, i.e. snow leopards significantly preferred cliff-dwelling wild ungulates (mainly bharal, 57% of identified material in scat samples), whereas wolves preferred typically plain-dwellers (Tibetan gazelle, kiang and argali, 31%). Livestock was consumed less frequently than their proportional availability by both predators (snow leopard = 27%; wolf = 24%), but significant avoidance was only detected among snow leopards. Among livestock species, snow leopards significantly preferred horses and goats, avoided yaks, and used sheep as available. We identified factors influencing diet composition using Generalized Linear Mixed Models. Wolves showed seasonal differences in the occurrence of small mammals/birds, probably due to the winter hibernation of an important prey, marmots. For snow leopard, occurrence of both wild ungulates and livestock in scats depended on sex and latitude. Wild ungulates occurrence increased while livestock decreased from south to north, probably due to a latitudinal gradient in prey availability. Livestock occurred more frequently in scats from male snow leopards (males: 47%, females: 21%), and wild ungulates more frequently in scats from females (males: 48%, females: 70%). The sexual difference agrees with previous telemetry studies on snow leopards and other large carnivores, and may reflect a high-risk high-gain strategy among males.																	1932-6203					FEB 8	2017	12	2							e0170549	10.1371/journal.pone.0170549								WOS:000393712500009	28178279					
J	Peng, X; Qiao, XF; Chen, MH				Peng, Xiong; Qiao, Xianfeng; Chen, Maohua			Responses of holocyclic and anholocyclic Rhopalosiphum padi populations to low-temperature and short-photoperiod induction	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												The different life cycles of aphid species make these organisms good models for studying the short-term consequences of sex. The bird cherry-oat aphid Rhopalosiphum padi has a wide geographic distribution and correspondingly different life cycles. In this study, the life cycles of R.padi collected from six different regions in China were characterized experimentally by comparing the responses of holocyclic and anholocyclic populations to low-temperature and short-photoperiod induction. Clones collected from Chuzhou, Taian, and Taigu consistently reproduced via obligate parthenogenesis, whereas clones from Hami and Baicheng were holocyclic in their response, and those from Lanzhou were both holocyclic and anholocyclic. Prolonged exposure to low temperature and a short photoperiod (LS) had negative effects on the offspring of anholocyclic aphids with regard to adult lifespan, total longevity, and fecundity compared with aphids maintained at a normal temperature and a long photoperiod (NL). Holocyclic LS R.padi had longer developmental times at all nymph stages, a shorter adult lifespan, shorter total longevity, and a lower fecundity than NL counterparts. The adult prereproduction period of gynoparae was significantly longer than that of virginoparae, and the total longevity of gynoparae was significantly shorter than that of virginoparae. Moreover, the net reproductive and gross reproduction rates, as well as the total fecundity, were roughly fivefold higher in virginoparae than in gynoparae, indicating that there is the short-term cost of sex. When maintained on their secondary host (Triticum aestivum), gynoparae, males, and oviparae produced by holocyclic populations could survive, and gynoparae produced oviparae. However, under NL conditions, oviparae could not produce overwintering eggs on the secondary host, whereas a few overwintering eggs were generated by oviparae under LS conditions. Taken together, these results illuminate the complexity of insect responses and contribute to a complete understanding of the aphid life cycle and its evolution.																	2045-7758					FEB	2017	7	4					1030	1042		10.1002/ece3.2720								WOS:000394501900002	28303175					
J	Mathur, V; Schmidt, PS				Mathur, Vinayak; Schmidt, Paul S.			Adaptive patterns of phenotypic plasticity in laboratory and field environments in Drosophila melanogaster	EVOLUTION												Identifying mechanisms of adaptation to variable environments is essential in developing a comprehensive understanding of evolutionary dynamics in natural populations. Phenotypic plasticity allows for phenotypic change in response to changes in the environment, and as such may play a major role in adaptation to environmental heterogeneity. Here, the plasticity of stress response in Drosophila melanogaster originating from two distinct geographic regions and ecological habitats was examined. Adults were given a short-term, 5-day exposure to combinations of temperature and photoperiod to elicit a plastic response for three fundamental aspects of stress tolerance that vary adaptively with geography. This was replicated both in the laboratory and in outdoor enclosures in the field. In the laboratory, geographic origin was the primary determinant of the stress response. Temperature and the interaction between temperature and photoperiod also significantly affected stress resistance. In the outdoor enclosures, plasticity was distinct among traits and between geographic regions. These results demonstrate that short-term exposure of adults to ecologically relevant environmental cues results in predictable effects on multiple aspects of fitness. These patterns of plasticity vary among traits and are highly distinct between the two examined geographic regions, consistent with patterns of local adaptation to climate and associated environmental parameters.																	0014-3820	1558-5646				FEB	2017	71	2					465	474		10.1111/evo.13144								WOS:000394985200022	27925178					
J	Tanaka, K; Murata, K				Tanaka, Koichi; Murata, Kouhei			Genetic Basis Underlying Rapid Evolution of an Introduced Insect Ophraella communa (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae): Heritability of Photoperiodic Response	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												The introduced beetle Ophraella communa LeSage has adapted to local environments in Japan in a short period by adjusting the photoperiodic response for induction of reproductive diapause. Based on these results, we predicted that the O. communa population has significant genetic variation in this trait on which natural selection should act. To examine the type and amount of genetic variation in photoperiodic response in O. communa, we performed artificial selection on this trait in opposite directions, i. e., directions of diapausing and nondiapausing under a photoperiod of 13: 11 (L: D) h, using three Tsukuba (Japan) lines derived from different years (2005, 2006, and 2012). Bidirectional selection shifted the diapause incidence to 100% in six or seven generations (diapausing selection) or 0% in five to eight generations (nondiapausing selection). The offspring produced by hybridization between diapausing and nondiapausing lines exhibited a wide range of diapause incidence under a photoperiod of 13: 11 (L: D) h, depending on the differences in the number of selected generations between the two parental lines. These results show that the photoperiodic response of O. communa is not inherited in a simple Mendelian manner but under polygenic control. Based on the results of artificial selection, we estimated the heritability of photoperiodic response, assuming polygenic inheritance. The heritability estimates were 0.770 to 0.856 in diapausing lines and 0.208 to 0.620 in nondiapausing lines, indicating substantial genetic variation in this trait. Thus, genetic variation in photoperiodic response of O. communa is one factor allowing the beetle to adapt rapidly to newly colonized habitats.																	0046-225X	1938-2936				FEB	2017	46	1					167	173		10.1093/ee/nvw142								WOS:000396902400020	28177078

Robertson			Geographic Variation of Plant Circadian Clock Function in Natural and Agricultural Settings	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL RHYTHMS												The increasing demand for improved agricultural production will require more efficient breeding for traits that maintain yield under heterogeneous environments. The internal circadian oscillator is essential for perceiving and coordinating environmental cues such as day length, temperature, and abiotic stress responses within physiological processes. To investigate the contribution of the circadian clock to local adaptability, we have analyzed circadian period by leaf movement in natural populations of Mimulus guttatus and domesticated cultivars of Glycine max. We detected consistent variation in circadian period along a latitudinal gradient in annual populations of the wild plant and the selectively bred crop, and this provides novel evidence of natural and artificial selection for circadian performance. These findings provide new support that the circadian clock acts as a central regulator of plant adaptability and further highlight the potential of applying circadian clock gene variation to marker-assisted breeding programs in crops.

J	Wei, H; Huang, Z; Lin, M				Wei, Heyi; Huang, Zhengdong; Lin, Mu			A Decision Support System for Plant Optimization in Urban Areas with Diversified Solar Radiation	SUSTAINABILITY												Sunshine is an important factor which limits the choice of urban plant species, especially in environments with high-density buildings. In practice, plant selection and configuration is a key step of landscape architecture, which has relied on an experience-based qualitative approach. However, the rationality and efficiency of this need to be improved. To maintain the diversity of plant species and to ensure their ecological adaptability (solar radiation) in the context of sustainable development, we developed the Urban Plants Decision Support System (UP-DSS) for assisting plant selection in urban areas with diversified solar radiation. Our methodology mainly consists of the solar radiation model and calibration, the urban plant database, and information retrieval model. The structure of UP-DSS is also presented at the end of the methodology section, which is based on the platform of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Microsoft Excel. An application of UP-DSS is demonstrated in a residential area of Wuhan, China. The results show that UP-DSS can provide a very scientific and stable tool for the adaptive planning of shade-tolerant plants and photoperiod-sensitive plants, meanwhile, it also provides a specific plant species and the appropriate types of plant community for user decision-making according to different sunshine radiation conditions and the designer's preferences.																	2071-1050					FEB	2017	9	2							215	10.3390/su9020215								WOS:000395590500057

Although C. insularis pupated and emerged at 20, 25, and 30 A degrees C, the pupation rate was lower at 20 A degrees C than at 25 and 30 A degrees C. These results suggest that the optimum temperature range for preadult development is 25-30 A degrees C. The duration of larval development was about 260 days for the first pupation group at 25 and 30 A degrees C, and at least 600 days at 20 A degrees C. Therefore, the C. insularis generation time was 2 years or more, as the total effective temperature for development from hatching to the pupal stage was unlikely to be reached within 1 year in Tokushima Prefecture. The second group pupated at 25 A degrees C, about 200 days after the first group. This periodicity of pupation was likely due to the free-running period of the circannual rhythm. Furthermore, although only the first group pupated at 30 A degrees C, the peak was almost synchronous with the first group at 25 A degrees C. These results indicate that the timing of the first pupation group in C. insularis is temperature compensated. Therefore we propose that the presence of an endogenous rhythm during the development of C. insularis is evidence for a circannual rhythm related to the timing of pupation.																	0003-6862	1347-605X				FEB	2017	52	1					29	35		10.1007/s13355-016-0450-3								WOS:000394150200004

Life cycle of Spinose ear tick, Otobius megnini (Acari: Argasidae) infesting the race horses in Nuwara Eliya, Sri Lanka	ACTA TROPICA												Otobius megnini infests mainly domesticated and wild animals and occasionally humans. It has been identified as an agent of human and horse otoacariasis in Sri Lanka. The number of nymphal stages in the life cycle of O. megnini varies from one to three in different geographic regions. The present study determined the life cycle of O. megnini infesting the racehorses in Nuwara Eliya. A tick colony was initiated from fully engorged nymphs collected from horses and maintained at 10 degrees C, 22 degrees C and 28 degrees C. Immature stages were reared on New Zealand rabbits. Only the larvae weighing more than 0.9 mg (84.9%) moulted to nymphs with a pre-moulting period of 5.6(+/- 1.7) days. None of the larvae maintained at 10 +/- 1 degrees C moulted. Larval survival was significantly higher at 28 +/- 1 degrees C (44.2 +/- 4.3 days) than at 22 +/- 1 degrees C (35.6 +/- 9 days). At 28 +/- 1 degrees C, majority of nymphs (95.6%) weighing over 10 mg moulted into adults within 12.5(+/- 3.1) days. Nymphs kept at 10 +/- 1 degrees C underwent diapause for 81.1(+/- 72.0) days. Larger females (>13 mg; 93.0%) laid eggs for of 44.6(+/- 17.8) days with a mean pre-oviposition period of 10.3(+/- 5.1) days. Females survived longer (369.8 +/- 128.3 days) than males (210.4 +/- 54.1 days; Student's t-test; t=5.9, p = 0.001). Some females laid eggs without mating. Otobius megnini successfully completed the life cycle within 123 days and has only one nymphal instar similar to the Neotropical population. Currently, O. megnini infestation is a serious problem to horses in the Nuwara Eliya racecourse and may pose a risk of spreading to dairy farms close by owing to its dynamic nature of the life cycle.

Moderate-intensity blue radiation can regulate flowering, but not extension growth, of several photoperiodic ornamental crops	ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY												Lighting that creates an effective phytochrome photoequilibrium at the end of the day (day extension) or during the middle of the night (night interruption) can regulate flowering of photoperiodic ornamentals grown under short days. In addition to phytochrome regulation, blue (B) radiation can elicit cryptochrome-mediated photoperiodic responses, such as flowering and stem growth. Although B radiation at a low intensity does not influence plant development, we postulated that it could regulate flowering at a higher intensity while acting as a plant growth regulator. We grew five long-day plants [calibrachoa (Calibrachoa x hybrida), coreopsis (Coreopsis grandiflora), petunia (Petunia x hybrida), rudbeckia (Rudbeckia hirta), and snapdragon (Antirrhinum majus)] and two short-day plants [chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum x morifolium) and marigold (Tagetes erecta)] in a controlled environment greenhouse under a 9-h short day with or without 5.5-h day-extension or 4-h night interruption lighting from light-emitting diodes. B radiation was delivered at 0, 1 (low), 15, or 30 (moderate) mu mol m(-2) s(-1) with or without low red (R) + white + far-red (FR) radiation. Moderate B radiation created long days in all crops as effectively as low R + virhite + FR radiation. Flowering of calibrachoa and petunia, but not other crops, was 2-4 d earlier when moderate B radiation was added to low R + white + FR radiation. At a sufficiently high intensity, B radiation possibly mediated these flowering responses through interactions of signaling molecules and multiple photoreceptors besides phytochromes. There were few or no morphological differences among flower-inducing treatments in most crops. We conclude that night-interruption lighting with moderate B radiation, alone and when added to low R and FR radiation, can regulate flowering, but does not inhibit extension growth, of a wide range of photoperiodic crops.

Hitching a ride: firewood as a potential pathway for range expansion of an exotic beech leaf- mining weevil, Orchestes fagi (Coleoptera: Curculionidae)	CANADIAN ENTOMOLOGIST												We investigated the potential for human-mediated range expansion of an exotic beech leaf-mining weevil, Orchestes fagi (Linnaeus) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Curculioninae: Rhamphini) (formerly known as Rhynchaenus fagi) on timber or firewood, which for eight to nine months of the year may harbour adults in diapause. In both relatively low-density and high-density populations, adults were found on the base, middle, and upper boles of the primary host, American beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrhart; Fagaceae), as well as red maple (Acer rubrum Linnaeus; Sapindaceae) and red spruce (Picea rubens Sargent; Pinaceae) in the vicinity. Comparatively few individuals were found on tree branches, or in the moss, duff, or soil collected beneath beech trees. Overwintering adults appeared to favour parts of trees with relatively high bark roughness. Our study suggests that, between the months of July through May, any woody stems near areas having O. fagi outbreaks are likely to harbour adults. Moreover, as all of the trees studied are common sources of timber or firewood, the harvest and transport of wood from these areas may facilitate outbreak spread; this may explain the multiple, distantly distributed populations of O. fagi that have been reported in eastern Nova Scotia, Canada in recent years.																	0008-347X	1918-3240				FEB	2017	149	1					129	137		10.4039/tce.2016.42								WOS:000392220200011

The Genetic Basis of Natural Variation in Drosophila (Diptera: Drosophilidae) Virgin Egg Retention	JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE												Drosophila melanogaster is able to thrive in harsh northern climates through adaptations in life-history traits and physiological mechanisms that allow for survival through the winter. We examined the genetic basis of natural variation in one such trait, female virgin egg retention, which was previously shown to vary clinally and seasonally. To further our understanding of the genetic basis and evolution of virgin egg retention, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using the previously sequenced Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) mapping population. We found 29 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with virgin egg retention and assayed 6 available mutant lines, each harboring a mutation in a candidate gene, for effects on egg retention time. We found that four out of the six mutant lines had defects in egg retention time as compared with the respective controls: mun, T48, Mes-4, and Klp67A. Surprisingly, none of these genes has a recognized role in ovulation control, but three of the four genes have known effects on fertility or have high expression in the ovaries. We also found that the SNP set associated with egg retention time was enriched for clinal SNPs. The majority of clinal SNPs had alleles associated with longer egg retention present at higher frequencies in higher latitudes. Our results support previous studies that show higher frequency of long retention times at higher latitude, providing evidence for the adaptive value of virgin egg-retention.																	1536-2442	2250-2645				JAN 27	2017	17								5	10.1093/jisesa/iew094								WOS:000396694500002

The results of this study demonstrated that digestive protease and amylase activity of S. exigua larvae was affected by both geographic origin of the pest and host plant cultivar. Three strains reared on the same sugar beet cultivars demonstrated different levels of proteolytic and amylolytic activities in fourth and fifth instars. The highest proteolytic and amylolytic activity, in most cases, was observed in larvae collected from Kalposh region. Among different sugar beet cultivars, the highest protease activity in three strains was observed on cultivars Rozier and Perimer. Nevertheless, the highest amylase activity was seen on cultivar Dorothea, and the lowest activity was seen on cultivar Rozier. This study suggested that variations in digestive enzymatic activity of three geographic strains of S. exigua might be attributed to local adaptation with their local host plant and environmental conditions inherent by larvae.																	1536-2442	2250-2645				JAN 27	2017	17								12	10.1093/jisesa/iew104								WOS:000396694500009

Here, we examine the role of factors in shaping breeding patterns in Rhinopithecus roxellana, a temperate colobine primate. We used circular statistics to describe and compare the patterns of reproductive seasonality, among individuals in 13 captive groups and two free ranging but provisioned groups at various locations throughout China. Almost 90% of births occurred in March, April and May in adult females residing in both free ranging (n = 131) and captive groups (n = 407). Births occurred principally in 2-4 months prior to the peak of food availability, while conceptions occurred in 1-2 months after the peak of food availability in free ranging but provisioned groups. Day length (latitude) had a significant effect on the timing of reproduction. However, females that experienced a wide variation of temperature between the lowest and highest monthly average temperature had a later conception date. These results support that day length and temperature might be factor influencing the timing of reproductive activity.

J	Randler, C; Rahafar, A				Randler, Christoph; Rahafar, Arash			Latitude affects Morningness-Eveningness: evidence for the environment hypothesis based on a systematic review	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Morningness-eveningness (M/E) is an individual trait related to a person's sleep-wake cycle and preference for morning or evening hours. The "environment hypothesis" suggests that M/E is dependent on environmental factors, such as latitude, mean average temperature and photoperiod. We here analyzed a large number of datasets to assess this effect based on a systematic review. Data were from a total of 87 datasets and 35,589 individuals based on 28 countries. Partial correlations correcting for age revealed significant relationships between M/E and latitude, mean yearly temperature, photoperiod and sunset. Evening orientation was related to higher latitude, longer days and later sunset. Morning orientation was related to higher average temperatures. Percentage of females and sunrise time had no significant influence. These variables (sunset, temperature, photoperiod) were then input in a general linear model. The full model showed an influence of age and of sunset on CSM scores, but not of photoperiod and average temperature. Sunset, therefore, seems to be the most important statistical predictor for the observed latitudinal gradient.																	2045-2322					JAN 3	2017	7								39976	10.1038/srep39976								WOS:000391168200001	28045131

This species is characterized by a fast developmental rate and a high reproductive potential. It reveals a number of adaptation strategies to adjust to changing environmental conditions. The paper presents the impact of temperature on developmental stages, fecundity, survival rate and the demographic parameters of A. craccivora rear on Robinia pseudoacacia. The research was carried out under control at five constant temperatures of 10, 15, 20, 25 and 28 degrees C, 75% humidity and photoperiod 16 L:8 D. The higher the temperature, the shorter the observed length of the pre-reproductive period, ranging from 6 days at 28 degrees C up to 24 days at 10 degrees C. The reproductive period also became shorter with the increase in temperature. A. craccivora female fecundity was dependent on temperature. The highest recorded rate of fecundity was observed when the temperature was 20 degrees C (on average 115 larvae/female). The developmental threshold was calculated to be 3.3 degrees C. The intrinsic rate (r(m)) was maximal (0.42) at 28 degrees C and minimal (0.07) at 10 degrees C. With increasing temperature there is a finite rate of increase, and the mean rate of generation development shortens. The research suggests that the best range of temperatures for the development of A. craccivora on R. pseudoacacia is between 20-28 degrees C. Therefore, in the future, with climate warming, Aphis craccivora may become more problematic.																	0370-4327						2017	100						65	71		10.19263/REDIA-100.17.07								WOS:000423140000007

Isoperla morenica shows a univoltine fast seasonal life cycle, with nymphs growing from November to April. After oviposition, eggs remain in a dormant state in the riverbed until the following autumn when the river water flows again. Nymphal diet is mainly composed of detritus in small individuals (they behave as gatherer-collectors) but when larger, they become predators. Brachyptera vera cordubensis also shows a univoltine fast seasonal life cycle, from November to March. Nymphs behave mainly as gatherer-collector and no significant ontogenetic changes in diet were detected. Male and female nymphs do not show differences in feeding in this species. Data obtained were compared with the previously known information on both species in another stream from the same mountain range as well as for other related species, and some differences in both aspects, mainly on feeding habits, could be detected.

Improved high-throughput quantification of luminescent microplate assays using a common Western-blot imaging system	METHODSX												Common Western-blot imaging systems have previously been adapted to measure signals from luminescent microplate assays. This can be a cost saving measure as Western-blot imaging systems are common laboratory equipment and could substitute a dedicated luminometer if one is not otherwise available. One previously unrecognized limitation is that the signals captured by the cameras in these systems are not equal for all wells. Signals are dependent on the angle of incidence to the camera, and thus the location of the well on the microplate. Here we show that: The position of a well on a microplate significantly affects the signal captured by a common Western-blot imaging system from a luminescent assay. The effect of well position can easily be corrected for. This method can be applied to commercially available luminescent assays, allowing for high-throughput quantification of a wide range of biological processes and biochemical reactions.

PRESCRIBED FIRE IN GRASSLAND BUTTERFLY HABITAT: TARGETING WEATHER AND FUEL CONDITIONS TO REDUCE SOIL TEMPERATURES AND BURN SEVERITY	FIRE ECOLOGY												Prescribed burning is a primary tool for habitat restoration and management in fire-adapted grasslands. Concerns about detrimental effects of burning on butterfly populations, however, can inhibit implementation of treatments. Burning in cool and humid conditions is likely to result in lowered soil temperatures and to produce patches of low burn severity, both of which would enhance survival of butterfly larvae at or near the soil surface. In this study, we burned 20 experimental plots in South Puget Sound, Washington, USA, prairies across a range of weather and fuel conditions to address the potential for producing these outcomes. Risk to diapausing butterfly larvae, assessed by measuring subsurface soil temperatures and heat dosages, was lower when air temperature was less than 26 degrees C and dead fuel moisture was greater than 9 %. The likelihood that unburned or low-severity patches would be left was affected by dead fuel moisture, but also required pre-existing fuel discontinuities. Burns conducted in the morning hours during the summer drought season (the main prescribed-fire season in this system) were cooler and had lower severities. This research increases our understanding of how fine fuel moisture and fuel continuity during grassland burning can affect fire intensity, severity, and spread. It also provides support for burning earlier in the day as a way to increase burn heterogeneity and has allowed us to create recommendations for burning in sensitive butterfly habitat.

Epigenetic Influences on Diapause	INSECT EPIGENETICS	Advances in Insect Physiology											Diapause is an endogenously regulated dormant state that allows insects and other animals to survive seasons of inimical conditions. Diapause is characterized by altered gene expression profiles, which mediate developmental arrest, metabolic depression, increased stress resistance, and other physiological and biochemical changes associated with this dormant state. In this chapter, I explore epigenetic processes that may regulate gene expression and contribute to the diapause phenotype. Only a few studies have explored the influence of DNA methylation, histone modification, and small RNA silencing on diapause. However, there is evidence that histone methylation and histone acetylation influence diapause in a wide range of species. In addition, microRNAs, siRNAs, and piRNAs appear to regulate gene expression before, during, and after diapause. Together, the accumulating evidence supports the inclusion of multiple epigenetic pathways in the "toolbox" of processes that regulate dormant states in insects and other animals.																	0065-2806		978-0-12-811834-4; 978-0-12-811833-7				2017	53						115	144		10.1016/bs.aiip.2017.03.003								WOS:000414395900006

However, the larvae cannot complete the development in a wide range of salinities. A study about the effect of salinity on the larval development was conducted in order to infer about adult dispersion and occurrence in a wide range of salinity. Two experiments were conducted: (1) from zoae I to megalopae stage and (2) from megalopa to juvenile stage. Larvae from eight females from Paranagua Bay, Parana, Brazil were obtained. After eclosion, for the first experiment, 100 zoea larvae from five females were acclimated, individualized and transferred to small aquariums with five distinct salinity treatments (S0, S5, S15, S25 and S35). For the second experiment, 50 megalopae from three females were individualized in aquariums in the same salinity treatments. Both experiments were conducted in incubator BOD with a constant temperature of 25 degrees C and photoperiod of 12 hours (light/ dark). Larvae were fed daily with eggs and naupli newly hatched of Artemia sp. The salinity affected the survival rate during the development in both experiments. Higher survival from zoea I to megalopa stage occurred in salinities 25 and 35 PSU, while from megalopa to juvenile stage in salinities 15 and 25 PSU. In both experiments the larvae did not tolerate low salinities as adults, with total mortality in S0 and S5. Our results suggest that the species have a larval export strategy of zoae larvae to oceanic regions (higher salinities) and megalopae needed to return to estuarine areas with intermediate salinities to complete the development. The occurrence of adults in estuarine areas with low (< 5 PSU) or high (> 25 PSU) salinities most likely occur after the metamorphosis to the juvenile stage by terrestrial dispersion or at the stage of megalopa (marine dispersion) during favourable weather events.

Natural Variation and Genetics of Photoperiodism in Wyeomyia smithii	NATURAL VARIATION AND CLOCKS	Advances in Genetics											Seasonal change in the temperate and polar regions of Earth determines how the world looks around us and, in fact, how we live our day-to-day lives. For biological organisms, seasonal change typically involves complex physiological and metabolic reorganization, the majority of which is regulated by photoperiodism. Photoperiodism is the ability of animals and plants to use day length or night length, resulting in life-historical transformations, including seasonal development, migration, reproduction, and dormancy. Seasonal timing determines not only survival and reproductive success but also the structure and organization of complex communities and, ultimately, the biomes of Earth. Herein, a small mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii, that lives only in the water-filled leaves of a carnivorous plant over a wide geographic range, is used to explore the genetic and evolutionary basis of photoperiodism. Photoperiodism in W. smithii is considered in the context of its historical biogeography in nature to examine the startling finding that recent rapid climate change can drive genetic change in plants and animals at break-neck speed, and to challenge the ponderous 80+ year search for connections between daily and seasonal time-keeping mechanisms. Finally, a model is proposed that reconciles the seemingly disparate 24-h daily clock driven by the invariant rotation of Earth about its axis with the evolutionarily flexible seasonal timer orchestrated by variable seasonality and driven by the rotation of Earth about the Sun.																	0065-2660		978-0-12-811812-2; 978-0-12-811811-5				2017	99						39	71		10.1016/bs.adgen.2017.09.002								WOS:000414513900003	29050554

We focused on bud:burst, leaf unfolding and leaf colouring. Temporal analysis indicated that the mean monthly air temperature increased, especially from April to August. An extraordinary increase of air temperature in March and April, mostly in the last decade, was detected. The precipitation from May to August varied considerably, but in the range of the long-term mean value. During the study period, the mean/earliest/latest onset of the bud-burst of common beech was observed on the 110th /101st/120th day of the year (DOY), respectively. As for leaf unfolding 10% and 50% (LU 10 and LU 50), we found the mean/earliest/latest onset on the 114th/103rd/122nd DOY and on the 118th/108th/124th DOY, respectively. The mean/earliest/latest onset of leaf colouring 10% (LC 10) and 50% (LC 50) started on the 272nd/262nd/288th DOY and on 286th/276th/298th, respectively. A medium degree of negative correlation (r = -0.68, P < 0.05) was found between air temperature and spring plant development (LU 50). In contrast, for both the cumulative temperature and precipitation, we found very low correlation with autumnal leaf phenology (r <= 0.3, P > 0.05). The vegetation period of the examined tree species lasted for 168 days on average (min/max were 155/183 days). Trend analysis revealed an earlier onset of spring phenophases by 7 days/2 decades. Conversely, a delay of autumnal phenophases by 9 days was recorded, so the vegetation period of beech extended by more than two weeks during the study period.																	1505-2249						2017	65	3					339	351		10.3161/15052249PJE2017.65.3.003								WOS:000412150800003

However, temporal patterns in species-specific habitat use, for instance due to climatic variation, may affect the strength of interspecific interactions, and generate temporal variation in niche partitioning. We assessed temporal variation in habitat overlap between a wild ungulate, moose Alces alces, and two freeranging domestic ungulates, sheep Ovis aries and cattle Bos taurus, on a boreal forest range in southern Norway. We also calculated the distance between species' realised niches, as well as the width of their realised niches to evaluate the extent of temporal niche partitioning under different diurnal weather conditions. Analyses of each habitat variable suggested complex relationships between species-specific habitat use, photoperiod, and weather, related to species-specific behaviour and activity patterns. We found shorter overall niche distance between moose and sheep, compared to moose and cattle, and shorter niche distances during day and night than during the twilight hours. The niche distance between moose and sheep was positively related to temperature during night, but negatively during day. Moreover, niche distance between moose and both sheep and cattle was negatively related to precipitation at daytime. Moose niche width was narrower in periods with short niche distance to sheep, while we did not find such pattern towards cattle. A lack of similar moose response to cattle could be attributed to lower niche overlap between moose and cattle. Our results suggest that temporal niche partitioning between moose and livestock breaks down under the weather conditions that are predicted to become more common as climate change, potentially increasing wildlife-livestock interactions in the future.																	0909-6396	1903-220X					2017									UNSP wlb.00275	10.2981/wlb.00275								WOS:000413458500001

Birch seedlings from 10 populations were therefore transplanted to 3 northern Fennoscandian sites (1 oceanic, 1 continental mountain and 1 Arctic coastal site). Annual measurements were carried out on growth parameters and phenology (date of budbreak) from 1992 onwards. At the coastal site, measurements covered the whole period 1993 to 2010, while at the 2 other sites measurements covered only the period 1993 to 1997 (mountain site) and 2010 to 2014 (both sites). During the last period (2010 to 2014), measurements were made on a new set of seedlings, transplanted in 2002. The plants suffered a temporary transplantation stress because of root damage. In general, budburst occurred earlier in populations from northern and continental sites than from southern and coastal sites. Survival rates were dependent on climate and were generally higher at the oceanic than at the mountain site, due to more autumn frost and insect damage at the latter. At the mountain site, survival rates were lowest in oceanic and southern populations; at the Arctic site, survival rates were lowest in continental populations; while at the oceanic site, only small differences were found between populations. The present results seem to indicate that climate is an important driver of change at the mountain birch treeline, although land-use changes may be more important in the short term. In the future, when a warmer climate is predicted, plants that are adapted to a coastal climate may expand their range, and increased winter temperatures are expected to favour insect-resistant polycormic birch inbreeding with dwarf birch Betula nana.																	0936-577X	1616-1572					2017	73	1-2					111	124		10.3354/cr01457								WOS:000408250000011

Pre-germinative treatments for seed dormancy breaking of three populations of Ramorinoa girolae, an endemic woody species from arid zones in Argentina	BOSQUE												For the conservation of species, especially those endemic or vulnerable, it is necessary to deepen the knowledge about their ecological dynamic and to find adequate techniques for multiplication. Ramorinoa girolae, "chica", is an endemic woody species of the xerophytic flora from western Argentine arid regions, with a restricted occupation area and fragmented communities. The lack of records makes relevant the conduction of research underpinning knowledge of the species, regeneration mechanisms and multiplication techniques. The objective of this work was to study the behavior of seeds of three populations under germination conditions and the response for different pre-germinative treatments. Germination trials were made in the laboratory with different pre-germinative techniques using the seeds of three populations under a completely aleatory design. Results confirm the presence of physical dormancy in seeds restricting the imbibing process for their rapid germination. The treatments, hot water scarification and mechanical scarification with sandpaper, increase significantly the germination percentages. The best treatment is mechanical scarification with sandpaper, reaching values of 92 % of germination at five days from the beginning of the treatment. The uneven response of germination of the different populations confirms the different behavior of local populations and results interesting for ecosystem studies and future lines of investigation and management of this species. These technical aspects appear as relevant for the application of reforestation and environmental restoration programs.																	0717-9200						2017	38	2					237	245		10.4067/S0717-92002017000200002								WOS:000407719800002

In a 24 h day there are conspicuous alterations in light intensity and spectrum. VIBGYOR is the visible portion of spectrum covering the light wavelength range from 380-760 nm. Each wavelength can activate the select class of photoreceptors, and hence a specific colour is experienced. Photoreceptors have opsin-based molecules that can trap light and thus play a key role in the perception of light and dark signals of the day. Eyes are the main photoreceptive structure but non-mammalian vertebrates such as birds have both retinal (eyes) and extra-retinal (e.g. lateral eyes, pineal, parapineal organs and deep brain photoreceptors) structures for photoreception. These opsin-based molecules found in different regions of the eyes and brain are sensitive to different wavelengths of light, hence play an important role in regulating the circadian and seasonal rhythms by decoding dawn and dusk; the time of maximum transition in wavelength and intensity of light. The melatonin pattern is also affected by light characteristics. In birds, the wavelength is shown to affect orientation and energy expenditure as well. This review focuses on different aspects of light wavelength and intensity affecting avian physiology and behaviour.																	0929-1016	1744-4179					2017	48	5			SI		739	746		10.1080/09291016.2017.1345449								WOS:000407952200006

Two-factorial experiments were conducted: (factor A: lamp type: LED and fluorescent, factor B: light colour: Red (denoted as R), Blue+White (B+W), Red+Blue (R+B); Green (G); White (W), Blue (B). For all colours the quantum irradiance was 35 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and the day length was 10 hours. The plant growing experiments were conducted in a controlled environment growth room. Measurements and observations were carried out at anthesis when 50% of all flower heads were completely developed. The measurements referred to plant features determining plant quality, i. e. the number of flower buds and flower head, diameter of flower head, height and diameter of plants, index of leaf greenness (SPAD). Plant quality was significantly dependent on light colour and the type of lamps used. Earlier flowering of plants was observed under LED lamps emitting white and blue light. The largest flower heads were produced by plants grown under blue and red + blue colour light. Red light emitted by both types of lamps had an adverse effect on plant flowering. Both the type of lamps and the colour of emitted light significantly modified the plant nutrient status. Interactions between the studied factors were found. The mean content of nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium and sulphur was higher in plants grown under LED than FL lamps. A similar trend was also found for the microelement content.																	1644-2296						2017	22	3					1015	1026		10.5601/jelem.2017.22.1.1252								WOS:000404270000014

Persistent reduction of segment growth and photosynthesis in a widespread and important sub-Arctic moss species after cessation of three years of experimental winter warming	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												1. Winter is a period of dormancy for plants of cold environments. However, winter climate is changing, leading to an increasing frequency of stochastic warm periods (winter warming events) and concomitant reductions in snow cover. These conditions can break dormancy for some plants and expose them to freeze-and-thaw stress. Mosses are a major component of high-latitude ecosystems, yet the longer-term impacts of such winter warming events on mosses remain unknown. 2. In order to determine the longer-term legacy effects of winter warming events on mosses, we undertook a simulation of these events over three consecutive winters in a sub-Arctic dwarf shrub-dominated open woodland. The mat-forming feather moss, Hylocomium splendens (the most abundant cryptogam in this system), is one of the most widespread Arctic and boreal mosses and plays a key functional role in ecosystems. We studied the ecophysiological performance of this moss during the summers of the experimental period (2007-2009) and in the following years (2010-2013). 3. We show that the previously reported warming-induced reduction in segment growth and photosynthesis during the experimental years was persistent. Four years after the last event, photosynthesis and segment growth were still 30 and 36% lower than control levels, which was only a slight improvement from 44 and 43% 4 years earlier. Winter warming did not affect segment symmetry. During the years after the last simulated event, in both warmed and control plots, chlorophyll fluorescence and segment growth, but not net photosynthesis, increased slightly. The increases were probably driven by increased summer rainfall over the study years, highlighting the sensitivity of this moss to rainfall change. 4. Overall, the legacy effects shown here demonstrate that this widespread and important moss is likely to be significantly disadvantaged in a future sub-Arctic climate where frequent winter warming events may become the norm. Given the key importance of mosses for soil insulation, shelter and carbon sequestration in high-latitude regions, such persistent impacts may ultimately affect important ecosystem functions.

Many Rickettsia species of the spotted fever group (SFG) cause tick-borne diseases known as "spotted fevers". The life cycle of SFG rickettsiae is closely associated with that of the tick, which is generally thought to act as a bacterial vector and reservoir that maintains the bacterium through transstadial and transovarial transmission. Each SFG member is thought to have adapted to a specific tick species, thus restricting the bacterial distribution to a relatively limited geographic region. These unique features of SFG rickettsiae allow investigation of how the genomes of such biologically and ecologically specialized bacteria evolve after genome reduction and the types of population structures that are generated. Here, we performed a nationwide, high-resolution phylogenetic analysis of Rickettsia japonica, an etiological agent of Japanese spotted fever that is distributed in Japan and Korea. The comparison of complete or nearly complete sequences obtained from 31 R. japonica strains isolated from various sources in Japan over the past 30 years demonstrated an extremely low level of genomic diversity. In particular, only 34 single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified among the 27 strains of the major lineage containing all clinical isolates and tick isolates from the three tick species. Our data provide novel insights into the biology and genome evolution of R. japonica, including the possibilities of recent clonal expansion and a long generation time in nature due to the long dormant phase associated with tick life cycles.

Life history traits of Characidium pterostictum (Characiformes, Crenuchidae) along the longitudinal gradient of a Neotropical river in southern Brazil	IHERINGIA SERIE ZOOLOGIA												Life history traits of Characidium pterostictum Gomes, 1947 (Characiformes, Crenuchidae) from three different reaches of the upper Sinos river, southern Brazil, were described and comparatively analyzed according to the longitudinal gradient. For all reaches, results indicated a seasonal reproductive strategy with a higher intensity during warmer months of higher photoperiod (November to February). Only females were found in the upstream reach and they were more numerous than males in all the sampled reaches. Mean absolute fecundity ranged from 5,189 (+/- 2,131 SD) to 7,394 (+/- 3,807 SD), whereas mean relative fecundity (oocytes per mg of female total weight) ranged from 1.08 (+/- 0.40 SD) to 1.12 (+/- 0.29 SD). Oocyte development was characterized as synchronic in two groups, typical of total spawning. Longitudinal gradient comparison suggests that body size (standard length) of C. pterostictum individuals and sex ratio were the only characteristics that differed between sampled reaches. Larger individuals and thus females tended to be more frequently found in upstream reaches of the Sinos river, with a decrease in body size and in the proportional number of females towards downstream.																	0073-4721	1678-4766					2017	107								UNSP e2017002	10.1590/1678-4766e2017002								WOS:000394004100002

Aspects of biology of Megalobulimus paranaguensis (Gastropoda, Acavoidea) in the coastal plain of the Brazilian southeast	IHERINGIA SERIE ZOOLOGIA												We studied the reproductive biology of Megalobulimus paranaguensis (Pilsbry & Ihering, 1900), a large and long-lived land gastropod from the Atlantic Rainforest of Brazil. The study was conducted at an urban park in the city of Santos, state of Sao Paulo. For 4 years, we counted the egg postures and annual eclosion rate of 32 captive snails and looked for associations between egg posture and the climatical variables of the period. The annual mean posture of 8.7 eggs per snail obtained in our results is a small number, but typical of Brazilian macromollusks. The annual eclosion rate was 31%. The beginning of the annual activity period of snails occurred in the middle of March, and lasted 33.97 +/- 3.02 weeks. The dormancy period started in the beginning of November, and lasted 18.39 +/- 3.11 weeks. There were two egg posture peaks, a minor peak between March and May, and a major peak between August and November, with greater values in September. Megalobulimus paranaguensis has a well-defined seasonal reproductive pattern influenced by environmental temperature and temperature range. Furthermore, in this snail, reproduction is negatively influenced by temperature increasing and temperature range.

Adaptive dynamics of cuticular hydrocarbons in Drosophila	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY												Cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) are hydrophobic compounds deposited on the arthropod cuticle that are of functional significance with respect to stress tolerance, social interactions and mating dynamics. We characterized CHC profiles in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster at five levels: across a latitudinal transect in the eastern United States, as a function of developmental temperature during culture, across seasonal time in replicate years, and as a function of rapid evolution in experimental mesocosms in the field. Furthermore, we also characterized spatial and temporal changes in allele frequencies for SNPs in genes that are associated with the production and chemical profile of CHCs. Our data demonstrate a striking degree of parallelism for clinal and seasonal variation in CHCs in this taxon; CHC profiles also demonstrate significant plasticity in response to rearing temperature, and the observed patterns of plasticity parallel the spatiotemporal patterns observed in nature. We find that these congruent shifts in CHC profiles across time and space are also mirrored by predictable shifts in allele frequencies at SNPs associated with CHC chain length. Finally, we observed rapid and predictable evolution of CHC profiles in experimental mesocosms in the field. Together, these data strongly suggest that CHC profiles respond rapidly and adaptively to environmental parameters that covary with latitude and season, and that this response reflects the process of local adaptation in natural populations of D. melanogaster.

Seasonal niche partitioning and coexistence of amphimictic and parthenogenetic lineages of Heterocypris barbara (Crustacea: Ostracoda)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Sympatry of amphimictic and parthenogenetic lineages in species with mixed reproductive systems is rarely observed in nature. On Lampedusa Island (Pelagie Islands, Italy), amphimictic and parthenogenetic lineages of Heterocypris barbara (Gauthier and Brehm, 1928) co-occur in a temporary pond. Their sympatric persistence calls for an ecological differentiation. We investigated the role of seasonal variation of temperature and photoperiod conditions by two different approaches: microcosms set up by inundation of dry sediments from the temporary pond and life-table experiments. Microcosms recreate conditions similar to the field and in their sediments random samples of resting eggs of both amphimictic and parthenogenetic females are stored. Life-table experiments supplied individual-based estimates of survivorship, adult life span, fecundity, and sex ratio in the progeny. We carried out the experiments at 24 degrees C and a photoperiod of 12 h light (L) : 12 h dark (D) (simulating fall conditions) and at 16 degrees C and a photoperiod of 10 h L : 14 h D (simulating winter conditions). Males and amphimictic females were the most numerous forms at 24 degrees C and 12 h L : 12 h D; parthenogenetic females were dominant at 16 degrees C and 10 h L : 14 h D. Life-table experiments showed that amphimictic forms do not complete development at 16 degrees C and 10 h L : 14 h D. Our results suggest that sympatry of amphimictic and parthenogenetic females in the field depends on seasonal niche partitioning and the storage effect of resting eggs that allows survival through adverse-season conditions.

Natural genetic variation for flowering time has been largely documented and has been instrumental to define the genetics of the photoperiodic pathway, as well as providing valuable material for artificial selection of varieties better adapted to local environments. We mined genetic variation in a collection of rice varieties highly adapted to European regions and isolated distinct variants of the long day repressor HEADING DATE 1 (Hd1) that perturb its expression or protein function. Specific variants allowed us to define novel features of the photoperiodic flowering pathway. We demonstrate that a histone fold domain scaffold formed by GRAIN YIELD, PLANT HEIGHT AND HEADING DATE 8 (Ghd8) and several NF-YC subunits can accommodate distinct proteins, including Hd1 and PSEUDO RESPONSE REGULATOR 37 (PRR37), and that the resulting OsNF-Y complex containing Hd1 can bind a specific sequence in the promoter of HEADING DATE 3A (Hd3a). Artificial selection has locally favored an Hd1 variant unable to assemble in such heterotrimeric complex. The causal polymorphism was defined as a single conserved lysine in the CCT domain of the Hd1 protein. Our results indicate how genetic variation can be stratified and explored at multiple levels, and how its description can contribute to the molecular understanding of basic developmental processes.

J	Shaw, P				Shaw, Phil			Rainfall, leafing phenology and sunrise time as potential Zeitgeber for the bimodal, dry season laying pattern of an African rain forest tit (Parus fasciiventer)	JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												Recent studies have documented a mismatch between the phenology of leaf production, prey availability and the nestling food requirements of north temperate songbirds, attributed to climate change effects. Although tropical forest species have often been regarded as relatively aseasonal breeders, similar disruptive effects can be expected at equatorial latitudes, where comparatively little is known of the links between weather, leafing phenology, food availability and bird breeding activity, particularly in complex rain forest habitats. During a 19-year study at 1A degrees S in Bwindi Impenetrable Forest, Uganda, Stripe-breasted Tits Parus fasciiventer showed a strongly bimodal laying pattern, breeding mainly in the two dry seasons, with 50 % of breeding activity occurring in January-February and 19 % in June-July. Individual females bred in both dry seasons, laying their first and last clutches up to 28 weeks apart. Breeding activity was linked to leaf production, which peaked mainly in November-December, following the September-November wet season. Increased leaf production is likely to have stimulated a rise in caterpillar numbers during December-February, coinciding with peak food demands by nestling tits. Laying was thus positively correlated with increased leaf production in the preceding calendar month, but was also linked to day length and a change in sunset time. To investigate possible links between egg laying and photic cues I compared the median date of first clutches laid by marked females in each half of the breeding year (October-March and April-September), with annual changes in photoperiod (varying by 7 min p.a.) and sunrise time (varying bimodally, by 31 min p.a.). The two median laying dates fell 138-139 days after the last date on which sunrise had occurred at 07:05 in August and January, suggesting the potential for sunrise time to act as a cue, or Zeitgeber, for breeding in tropical birds. Further work is required to establish whether the relationship is causative or coincidental.																	0021-8375	1439-0361				JAN	2017	158	1					263	275		10.1007/s10336-016-1395-6								WOS:000393670600025

Inbreeding naturally occurred under geographic isolation, on Asinara Island, in the Mediterranean Sea. Albino individuals can be more susceptible to develop health problems when exposed to natural sun radiation. Alternative metabolic pathways involved in photoprotection were explored in this trial. Nutrition-related metabolites are believed to contribute to the conservation of Asinara donkeys, in which melanin, guaranteeing photoprotection, is lacking. Biochemical profiles with particular focus on blood serum beta-carotene and retinol levels were monitored. Identical natural grazing conditions for both Asinara (albino) and Sardo (pigmented) donkey breeds were assured on same natural pastures throughout the experimental period. A comparative metabolic screening, with emphasis on circulating retinol and nutrient-related metabolites between the two breeds, was carried out over one year. Potential intra-and interspecimen fluctuations of metabolites involved in photoprotection were monitored, both during negative and positive photoperiods. Differences (p=.064) between blood serum concentrations of retinol from Asinara versus Sardo breed donkeys (0.630 vs. 0.490 mu g/ml, respectively) were found. Retinol levels of blood serum turned out to be similar in the two groups (0.523 vs. 0.493 mu g/ml, respectively, p=.051) during the negative photoperiod, but markedly differed during the positive one (0.738 vs. 0.486, respectively, p=.016). Blood serum beta-carotene levels displayed to be constantly around the limit of sensitivity in all animals of both breeds. Variations in blood serum concentrations of retinol in Asinara white donkeys can reflect the need to cope with seasonal exposure to daylight at Mediterranean latitudes, as an alternative to the lack of melanin. These results may suggest that a pulsed mobilization of retinol from body stores occurs to increase circulating levels during positive photoperiod.

Effects of substrate salinity on oviposition, embryonic development and survival in the Australian plague locust, Chortoicetes terminifera (Walker)	JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY												The Australian plague locust, Chortoicetes terminifera (Walker), is an important agricultural pest that oviposits into soil across vast semi-arid and arid regions. This study aimed to determine whether gravid female locusts can discriminate among substrates of increasing salinity (0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 28 ppt NaCl) when attempting oviposition, and quantify the effects of saline substrate on direct developing egg viability, and subsequent hatchling nymph body weight and survival. Gravid female locusts increasingly excavated and withdrew prior to completing oviposition in substrates of increasing salinity, but similar numbers of completed egg pods were observed across treatments. Egg weight at 50% total development time and successful egg development to nymph emergence decreased with increasing substrate salinity. Water balance equilibrium between the egg and the substrate occurred at approximately 12 ppt NaCl corresponding to a water activity of similar to 0.995. Eggs oviposited into sand containing <= 12 ppt NaCl weighed >= 6.26 +/- 0.91 mg and had >= 76.8% successful development to nymph emergence. Eggs oviposited into sand containing >12 ppt NaCl weighed <= 5.16 +/- 1.27 mg and had <= 45.6% successful development to nymph emergence. Hatchling nymph body weight and survival to second instar also decreased with increasing substrate salinity. Nymphs that hatched and emerged from sand containing <= 12 ppt NaCl weighed >= 5.55 +/- 0.43 mg at emergence and had >= 68.9% survival. Nymphs that hatched and emerged from sand containing >12 ppt NaCl weighed <= 5.28 +/- 0.67 mg at emergence and had <= 52.0% survival. These results indicate that C. terminifera is sufficiently resilient to develop and survive in saline substrates over most of their range.

Quantifying E-C is of both scientific and practical importance, providing information relevant to questions ranging from energy partitioning to ecosystem services, such as primary productivity and water yield. We estimated E-C of four pine stands differing in age and growing on sandy soils. The stands consisted of two wide-ranging conifer species: Pinus taeda and Pinus sylvestris, in temperate and boreal zones, respectively. Combining results from these and published studies on all soil types, we derived an approach to estimate daily E-C of pine forests, representing a wide range of conditions from 35 degrees S to 64 degrees N latitude. During the growing season and under moist soils, maximum daily E-C (E-Cm) at day-length normalized vapor pressure deficit of 1 kPa (ECm-ref) increased by 0.55 +/- 0.02 (mean +/- SE) mm/d for each unit increase of leaf area index (L) up to L = similar to 5, showing no sign of saturation within this range of quickly rising mutual shading. The initial rise of E-Cm with atmospheric demand was linearly related to ECm-ref. Both relations were unaffected by soil type. Consistent with theoretical prediction, daily E-C was sensitive to decreasing soil moisture at an earlier point of relative extractable water in loamy than sandy soils. Our finding facilitates the estimation of daily E-C of wide-ranging pine forests using remotely sensed L and meteorological data. We advocate an assembly of worldwide sap flux database for further evaluation of this approach.

The interactive effects of photoperiod and future climate change may have negative consequences for a wide-spread invasive insect	OIKOS												Increasing global temperatures may affect many ectotherms, including insects, although increasing temperatures are thought to benefit future populations through effects on adult size, fecundity, or populations. However, the way that temperature may interact with photoperiod is not well understood. We study this problem using the Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus, an important worldwide invasive whose future spread is thought to be affected by changes in climate. We investigated how mass at maturity varied with temperature (21 degrees C, 25 degrees C) across short and long photoperiods, using laboratory populations from the extreme ends of this species' current US range (Florida, New Jersey). These values were used to parametrize a model to predict optimal mass based on development times; the results of a second laboratory experiment under the same treatments were compared to model predictions. Warmer conditions shortened development times in females from all locations leading to either higher or lower mass depending on the photoperiod. We then used published mass-fecundity relationships to determine the consequences of mass on fecundity under our conditions. Under the majority of scenarios warming decreased predicted fecundity under long photoperiods, but proved beneficial under short photoperiods because the costs of fast development were offset by increased survival in the face of late-season freezing risk. However, fecundity was always low under short photoperiods, so the marginal benefit of warming appears negligible given its cost under long photoperiods when the majority of reproduction occurs. Thus, with northern range expansion, where colder weather currently limits this species, detrimental effects of warming on fecundity are likely, similar to those identified for mass. Unlike previous work that has shown benefits of a warming planet to insects like Aedes albopictus, our work predicts lower performance under warming conditions in summer across the current range, a prediction with implications for range expansion, disease dynamics and populations.																	0030-1299	1600-0706				JAN	2017	126	1					40	51		10.1111/oik.03635								WOS:000391947400005

In an effort to understand the thermal tolerance and the impact of temperature elevation on tissue metabolism of land snails we determined the mortality, heamolymph PO2 and the activities of enzymes of intermediary metabolism in three land snail species (Helix lucorum, Helix pomatia and Cornu aspersum) differing in their geographical distribution and inhabiting areas with different climatic characteristics. No mortality was observed in both population of Cornu aspersum, while Helix pomatia exhibited higher mortality than Helix lucorum. PO2 dropped within the first 10 days of exposure to elevated temperature in all species, although in Cornu aspersum this decrease was significantly lower. No significant reduction in the enzymatic activities of all glycolytic enzymes studied, as well as of citrate synthase (CS) and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HOAD) was observed in the more thermal tolerant species C. aspersum from both populations studied. Significant reductions of enzymatic activity of the glycolytic enzymes phosphofructokinase (PFK), pyruvate kinase (PM) and D-Lactate dehydrogenase (D-LDH) was observed in Helix lucorum and Helix pomatia. The observed inter-specific differences seem to be in accordance with the life cycle characteristics of each species and may be attributed to climatic differences among habitats within their distribution range.

Besides toxicological relevance, PM has been recently suggested to exert epigenetic effects by altering DNA methylation patterns. Here, we investigated for the first time the association between the exposure to free-air PM10 and DNA methylation at two loci ('poly-Q exon' and '5'-UTR') of the Clock gene in blood cells of the nestlings of a synanthropic passerine bird, the barn swallow (Hirundo rustica). The Clock gene is a phylogenetically highly conserved gene playing a major role in governing circadian rhythms and circannual life cycles of animals, implying that change in its level of methylation can impact on important fitness traits. We found that methylation at both loci significantly increased with PM10 levels recorded few days before blood sampling, and also with PM10 exposure experienced by the mother during or shortly before egg laying. This study is the first where methylation at a functionally important gene has been shown to vary according to the concentration of anthropogenic pollutants in any animal species in the wild. Since early-life environmental conditions produce epigenetic effects that can transgenerationally be transmitted, DNA methylation of genes controlling photoperiodic response can have far reaching consequences for the ecology and the evolution of wild animal populations.

Toward mapping crop progress at field scales through fusion of Landsat and MODIS imagery	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The ability to regionally monitor crop progress and condition through the growing season benefits both crop management and yield estimation. In the United States, these metrics are reported weekly at state or district (multiple counties) levels by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) using field observations provided by trained local reporters. However, the ground data collection process supporting this effort is time consuming and subjective. Furthermore, operational crop management and yield estimation efforts require information with more granularity than at the state or district level. This paper evaluates remote sensing approaches for mapping crop phenology using vegetation index time-series generated by fusing Landsat and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) surface reflectance imagery to improve temporal sampling over that provided by Landsat alone. The case study focuses on an agricultural region in central Iowa from 2001 to 2014. Our objectives are 1) to assess Landsat-MODIS data fusion results over cropland; 2) to map crop phenology at 30 m resolution using fused surface reflectance data; and 3) to identify the relationships between remotely sensed crop phenology metrics and the crop progress stages reported by NASS. The results show that detailed spatial and temporal variability in vegetation development across this landscape can be identified using the fused Landsat-MODIS data. The mean difference (bias) in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) between actual Landsat observations and the fused Landsat-MODIS data, generated for Landsat overpass dates, is in the range of 0.011 to 0.028 for every year. The derived phenological metrics show distinct features for different crops and natural vegetation at field scales. Strong correlations are observed between remotely sensed phenological stages, based on NDVI curve inflection points, and the observed crop physiological growth stages from the NASS Crop Progress (CP) reports. The green-up dates detected from remote sensing data typically occurred during crop vegetative stages when 2-4 leaves were developed for both corn and soybeans, or about 1-3 weeks after the reported emergence dates when the plant were first visible to ground based observers. Despite being a lagging indicator, remotely sensed green-up can be used effectively to backcast emergence, e.g. as input to spatially distributed crop models. The differences in green-up date between corn and soybean were 8-10 days, consistent with the offset in emergence dates reported by NASS at district level. The reported harvest dates were typically about 2-3 weeks after the dormancy stage was detected via remote sensing for corn and about 1-2 weeks for soybeans. This suggests that probable harvest times for individual fields may be predicted 1-3 weeks ahead using remote sensing data. The results suggest that crop phenology and certain growth stages at field scales (30 m spatial resolution) can be linked and mapped by integrating imagery from multiple remote sensing platforms.

J	Labruna, MB; Gerardi, M; Krawczak, FS; Moraes, J				Labruna, Marcelo B.; Gerardi, Monize; Krawczak, Felipe S.; Moraes-Filho, Jonas			Comparative biology of the tropical and temperate species of Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato (Acari: Ixodidae) under different laboratory conditions	TICKS AND TICK-BORNE DISEASES												Recent studies have shown that the taxon Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato (s.l.) is represented in Latin America by two distinct species, designated as 'tropical species' (distributed from Mexico to Brazil) and 'temperate species' (restricted to the southern cone of South America). Since both tropical and temperate species of R. sanguineus s.l. are parasites primarily of domestic dogs, the reasons for their distinct geographical distribution in South America could be related to particular requirements of abiotic conditions for off-host development. With the purpose to test this hypothesis, this study evaluated the off-host developmental stages (eggs, engorged larvae, nymphs and females) of both tick species simultaneously inside incubators with temperature and photoperiod regimens that simulated the summer and winter conditions of tropical Brazil (where the 'tropical species' occurs) and temperate Brazil (where the 'temperate species' occurs). Results showed that the temperate species had significantly higher survival-rates than the tropical species, when engorged ticks (larvae, nymphs and females) and eggs were incubated at lower temperatures simulating winter seasons of many parts of the southern cone of South America, where the temperate species is known to occur. These results suggest that the absence of established populations of the tropical species in temperate areas of South America is related to the low overwinter capacity of the tropical species in those areas. Regarding the temperate species, unfed adults that molted from nymphs under summer conditions of either tropical or temperate Brazil remained dormant, at the state of behavioral diapause for at least 20 weeks. Contrastingly, when engorged nymphs of the temperate species were held at winter conditions for at least 3 months, and then transferred to summer conditions to complete molting, no diapause was observed in adult ticks. These results were corroborated by infestation trials, which showed that diapausing adult ticks took more days to attach to rabbits, and did in lesser numbers, when compared to nondiapausing adult ticks. Contextualization of our results in the current literature suggests that absence of established populations of the temperate species in tropical Brazil is linked to the fact that adult ticks would become inactive (diapause) right after molting from nymphs at any period of the year. On the other hand, absence of established populations of the tropical species in temperate Brazil is linked to the fact that this tick species would not enter diapause, and therefore, could not synchronize its life-cycle to avoid the lethal effects of a more severe winter on its developmental stages. Indeed, such assumptions should be corroborated by additional studies testing different populations of the tropical and temperate species, including more studies under natural conditions.

The polymitarcyid burrowing mayfly, Ephoron nigridorsum, adapts to extreme continental climate by undergoing egg diapause during the long and cold winter and rapid growth during the short and hot summer. We performed genetic analyses of the mitochondrial COI gene of E. nigridorsum from 10 local populations of the Selenge River basin in Mongolia to examine the historical population dynamics during the last glacial period. 2. We observed high overall genetic diversity and high intra-population variation. However, we could find no geographic cluster of haplotypes and no correlation between genetic differentiation and geographic distance within the river basin. 3. The long-chain haplotype network and multimodal mismatch distribution implied that the population size has remained constant for a long period of time. The Bayesian skyline plot indicated an expansion of the population size during cooling through the last glacial period and a stable population size from the post-glacial period to the present day. 4. Our results suggest that the Selenge River basin provided a comparatively stable habitat for E. nigridorsum during the last glacial period when the decrease in mean air temperature in summer (1-7 degrees C colder) is smaller than that of winter temperature (7-15 degrees C colder) according to botanical records. The mayfly has been probably capable of adapting to a more extreme climate - i.e. with a larger temperature difference between winter and summer - during the last glacial period by undergoing egg diapause, as montane and arctic species of cold-adapted aquatic insects have expanded their distributions and population sizes during this period.																	0046-5070	1365-2427				JAN	2017	62	1					102	110		10.1111/fwb.12853								WOS:000390146000009

Although phasiRNAs have been found in a range of organisms, their biological functions in plants have yet to be uncovered. Here we show that phasiRNAs generated by the photopheriod-sensetive genic male sterility 1 (Pms1) locus were associated with photoperiod-sensitive male sterility (PSMS) in rice, a germplasm that started the two-line hybrid rice breeding. The Pms1 locus encodes a long-noncoding RNA PMS1T that was preferentially expressed in young panicles. PMS1T was targeted by miR2118 to produce 21-nt phasiRNAs that preferentially accumulated in the PSMS line under long-day conditions. A single nucleotide polymorphism in PMS1T nearby the miR2118 recognition site was critical for fertility change, likely leading to differential accumulation of the phasiRNAs. This result suggested possible roles of phasiRNAs in reproductive development of rice, demonstrating the potential importance of this RNA class as regulators in biological processes.

Alternative Splicing of Barley Clock Genes in Response to Low Temperature	PLOS ONE												Alternative splicing (AS) is a regulated mechanism that generates multiple transcripts from individual genes. It is widespread in eukaryotic genomes and provides an effective way to control gene expression. At low temperatures, AS regulates Arabidopsis clock genes through dynamic changes in the levels of productive mRNAs. We examined AS in barley clock genes to assess whether temperature-dependent AS responses also occur in a monocotyledonous crop species. We identify changes in AS of various barley core clock genes including the barley orthologues of Arabidopsis AtLHY and AtPRR7 which showed the most pronounced AS changes in response to low temperature. The AS events modulate the levels of functional and translatable mRNAs, and potentially protein levels, upon transition to cold. There is some conservation of AS events and/or splicing behaviour of clock genes between Arabidopsis and barley. In addition, novel temperature-dependent AS of the core clock gene HvPPD-H1 (a major determinant of photoperiod response and AtPRR7 orthologue) is conserved in monocots. HvPPD-H1 showed a rapid, temperature-sensitive isoform switch which resulted in changes in abundance of AS variants encoding different protein isoforms. This novel layer of low temperature control of clock gene expression, observed in two very different species, will help our understanding of plant adaptation to different environments and ultimately offer a new range of targets for plant improvement.

Gene structure, expression, and DNA methylation characteristics of sea cucumber cyclin B gene during aestivation	GENE												The sea cucumber, Apostichopus japonicus, is a good model for studying environmentally-induced aestivation by a marine invertebrate. One of the central requirements of aestivation is the repression of energy-expensive cellular processes such as cell cycle progression. The present study identified the gene structure of the cell cycle regulator, cyclin B, and detected the expression levels of this gene over three stages of the annual aestivation-arousal cycle. Furthermore, the DNA methylation characteristics of cyclin B were analyzed in non-aestivation and deep aestivation stages of sea cucumbers. We found that the cyclin B promoter contains a CpG island, three CCAAT-boxes and three cell cycle gene homology regions (CHRs). Application of qRT-PCR analysis showed significant downregulation of cyclin B transcript levels during deep-aestivation in comparison with non-aestivation in both intestine and longitudinal muscle, and these returned to basal levels after arousal from aestivation. Methylation analysis of the cyclin B core promoter revealed that its methylation level showed significant differences between non-aestivation and deep-aestivation stages (p < 0.05) and interestingly, a positive correlation between Cyclin B transcripts expression and methylation levels of the core promoter was also observed. Our findings suggest that cell cycle progression may be reversibly arrested during aestivation as indicated by the changes in cyclin B expression levels and we propose that DNA methylation is one of the regulatory mechanisms involved in cyclin B transcriptional variation.

Effects of temperature and availability of insect prey on bat emergence from hibernation in spring	JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY												Bats at northern latitudes may hibernate for up to 8 months during winter and must subsist on stored fat over this period. Environmental influences on bat emergence from hibernation are not well understood, and the degree to which bat emergence coincides with availability of their insect prey is not known. We used electronic detectors to monitor bat activity from 2001 to 2013 at a major hibernaculum, used primarily by Myotis lucifugus, in Wisconsin. We estimated dates of entry into hibernation in fall and recorded bat activity as bats emerged in spring over this 13-year period. Temperatures outside and inside the mine and airflow at the mine entrance were measured. Night-flying insects were monitored during spring from 2008 to 2013. Bat activity in spring was most strongly associated with warmer temperatures outside of the mine and was also correlated with airflow in the mine entrance. Changes in airflow were driven by temperature differentials between the mine and outside, and could serve as a signal for outside temperatures to bats inside of the mine. Insect abundance was also positively correlated with warmer outside temperatures. However, bat activity peaked before insects started to become abundant. Over the 13 years of the study, the date at which 5% of bat activity for the season was reached ranged from 10 April to 20 April, and for 50% of bat activity for the season the range was from 28 April to 4 May. The date of 5% bat activity for the season was not correlated with the date of entry into hibernation the previous fall, mean winter temperatures inside or outside of the mine, or the degree days (base 0 degrees C) inside or outside of the mine. Our study was conducted before white-nose syndrome was documented in Wisconsin, thus our study documents hibernation behavior of healthy bats.																	0022-2372	1545-1542				DEC	2016	97	6					1623	1633		10.1093/jmammal/gyw126								WOS:000392849900012

Using a Novel Partitivirus in Pseudogymnoascus destructans to Understand the Epidemiology of White-Nose Syndrome	PLOS PATHOGENS												White-nose syndrome is one of the most lethal wildlife diseases, killing over 5 million North American bats since it was first reported in 2006. The causal agent of the disease is a psychrophilic filamentous fungus, Pseudogymnoascus destructans. The fungus is widely distributed in North America and Europe and has recently been found in some parts of Asia, but interestingly, no mass mortality is observed in European or Asian bats. Here we report a novel double-stranded RNA virus found in North American isolates of the fungus and show that the virus can be used as a tool to study the epidemiology of White-nose syndrome. The virus, termed Pseudogymnoascus destructans partitivirus-pa, contains 2 genomic segments, dsRNA 1 and dsRNA 2 of 1.76 kbp and 1.59 kbp respectively, each possessing a single open reading frame, and forms isometric particles approximately 30 nm in diameter, characteristic of the genus Gammapartitivirus in the family Partitiviridae. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the virus is closely related to Penicillium stoloniferum virus S. We were able to cure P. destructans of the virus by treating fungal cultures with polyethylene glycol. Examination of 62 isolates of P. destructans including 35 from United States, 10 from Canada and 17 from Europe showed virus infection only in North American isolates of the fungus. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis using nucleotide sequences of the viral coat protein geographically clustered North American isolates indicating fungal spread followed by local adaptation of P. destructans in different regions of the United States and Canada. This is the first demonstration that a mycovirus potentially can be used to study fungal disease epidemiology.

J	Delisle, J; Bernier-Cardou, M; Laroche, G				Delisle, Johanne; Bernier-Cardou, Michele; Laroche, Ghislaine			Reproductive performance of the hemlock looper, Lambdina fiscellaria, as a function of temperature and population origin	ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA												In a recent study of the hemlock looper (HL), Lambdina fiscellaria (Guenee) (Lepidoptera: Geometridae), long exposure of early-diapausing eggs to high temperatures considerably reduced their ability to hatch. This finding raised the possibility that adults could also be negatively affected by increasing temperatures if they reproduced too early in the season in response to global warming. To investigate this hypothesis, newly formed HL pupae from three populations of eastern Canada - Quebec (QC), Newfoundland (NL), and Labrador (LB) - were submitted to four constant temperatures (10, 15, 20, or 25 degrees C) during pupal and adult development. The effect of population origin on HL reproduction was generally negligible. Mating probability was high at 15 and 20 degrees C (0.86 and 0.83, respectively), quite low at 10 degrees C (0.53), and even lower at 25 degrees C (0.38). Mating started earlier in the night and lasted longer as temperature decreased. Both productivity and absolute fecundity increased when temperature increased from 10 to 15 degrees C and then decreased slowly as temperature increased further. Over populations and temperatures, relative fecundity averaged 0.95, indicating that females had enough time to lay most of their eggs before they died. High temperatures had a deleterious effect on egg fertility: between 10 and 20 degrees C, relative fertility was about 0.90, but it dropped to 0.51 at 25 degrees C. The average proportion of fertile eggs declined from 0.88 in the first quarter of the egg-laying period to 0.57 in the last quarter, suggesting lower sperm count or viability, or deterioration of the oocytes as the egg-laying period progresses. Based on these findings, we argue that the production of an additional fifth instar among HL populations of southern origin can be viewed as an adaptive mechanism allowing adults to postpone reproduction or the egg-laying period in order to mitigate the detrimental effect of high temperatures on their probability of mating successfully or that of laying fertile eggs.																	0013-8703	1570-7458				DEC	2016	161	3					219	231		10.1111/eea.12469								WOS:000391948800008

Investigations on the genetic basis of circannual rhythmicity in vertebrates have highlighted that variation at candidate 'circadian clock' genes may play a major role in regulating photoperiodic responses and timing of life cycle events, such as reproduction and migration. In this comparative study of 23 trans-Saharan migratory bird species, we investigated the relationships between species-level genetic variation at two candidate genes, Clock and Adcyap1, and species' traits related to migration and geographic distribution, including timing of spring migration across the Mediterranean Sea, migration distance and breeding latitude. Consistently with previous evidence showing latitudinal clines in 'circadian clock' genotype frequencies, Clock allele size increased with breeding latitude across species. However, early-and late-migrating species had similar Clock allele size. Species migrating over longer distances, showing delayed spring migration and smaller phenotypic variance in spring migration timing, had significantly reduced Clock (but not Adcyap1) gene diversity. Phylogenetic confirmatory path analysis suggested that migration date and distance were the most important variables directly affecting Clock gene diversity. Hence, our study supports the hypothesis that Clock allele size increases poleward as a consequence of adaptation to the photoperiodic regime of the breeding areas. Moreover, we show that long-distance migration is associated with lower Clock diversity, coherently with strong stabilizing selection acting on timing of life cycle events in long-distance migratory species, likely resulting from the time constraints imposed by late spring migration.

Various phytochemicals such as triterpenoids, flavonol glycosides, anthocyanins and steroids are reported in this species. Plant types with white and purple flowers are reported to occur in different regions of India. The phytochemical diversity with reference to geographical locations are not available for this species. Understanding the phytochemical diversity and characterization of genotypes are essential for commercial cultivation, conservation and future breeding programme. In the present study, we evaluated the phytochemical diversity of 19 accessions from different geographical regions from India in terms of flavonoid accumulation. Flavonoid content significantly (p < 0.05) varied in the species with geographical locations, and were in range from 1.0 +/- 0.06 to 3.5 +/- 0.1 mg/g of quercetin and 4.1 +/- 0.08 to 8.5 +/- 0.17 mg/g of kaempferol in dry leaf of C. ternatea. Highest kaempferol content was found in ODB-W; quercetin was highest in AP-B accession, while MH-T accession had the lowest kaempferol and quercetin among the accessions. Seed germination aspect of C. ternatea was studied as the plant belongs to a fabaceae family having seed coat dormancy and still there is a gap in availability of information on its seed germination. Effect of acid treatment on seed germination indicated that C. ternatea seed coat dormancy could be efficiently removed by treating with concentrated sulfuric acid for 10-15 min at 30 degrees C.																	0019-5022					DEC	2016	86	12					1553	1558										WOS:000391077500005

Day length unlikely to constrain climate-driven shifts in leaf-out times of northern woody plants	NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE												The relative roles of temperature and day length in driving spring leaf unfolding are known for few species, limiting our ability to predict phenology under climate warming(1,2). Using experimental data, we assess the importance of photoperiod as a leaf-out regulator in 173 woody species from throughout the Northern Hemisphere, and we also infer the influence of winter duration, temperature seasonality, and inter-annual temperature variability. We combine results from climate-and light-controlled chambers with species' native climate niches inferred from georeferenced occurrences and range maps. Of the 173 species, only 35% relied on spring photoperiod as a leaf-out signal. Contrary to previous suggestions, these species come from lower latitudes, whereas species from high latitudes with long winters leafed out independent of photoperiod. The strong effect of species' geographic-climatic history on phenological strategies complicates the prediction of community-wide phenological change.

Recent studies have directly quantified niche and competitive ability differences in experimental communities at small spatial scales, but provide limited information about stable coexistence across spatial scales in heterogeneous natural communities. In this study, we use experimental and observational approaches to explore evidence for niche and competitive ability differences between two closely related, ecologically similar and widely coexisting annual forbs: Trachymene cyanopetala and T. ornata. We experimentally tested for stabilizing niche differences and competitive ability differences between these species by manipulating species' frequencies, under both well-watered and water-stressed conditions. We considered these experimental results in light of extensive field observations to explore evidence of niche segregation at a range of spatial scales. We found little evidence of intra-specific stabilization or competitive ability differences in laboratory experiments while observational studies suggested niche segregation across pollinator assemblages and small-scale microclimate heterogeneity. Though we did not quantify long-term stabilization of coexisting populations of these species, results are consistent with expectations for stable coexistence of similar species via a spatial storage effect allowing niche differences to overcome even small (to absent) competitive ability differences.

Pathogen invasion triggers an evolutionary trap for an endangered checkerspot butterfly dependent on an exotic host plant	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Exotic pathogen invasions can change host eco-evolutionary interactions and possibly create an evolutionary trap when the pathogen generates mismatches between developmental phenology and reproductive cues. Taylor's checkerspot butterfly (Euphydryas editha taylori), is an endangered species of western North America with 80 % of the extant populations dependent on an exotic host, Plantago lanceolata. Survey of occupied, recently extinct, and unsuccessful butterfly reintroduction sites spanning 4 degrees of latitude revealed widespread disease on P. lanceolata caused by Pyrenopeziza plantaginis. This fungal pathogen, new to North America, reduces the standing crop of P. lanceolata foliage throughout the winter post-diapause larval feeding period. However, disease is absent when adult butterflies and pre-diapause larvae are active. Diseased plants were frequent in Taylor's checkerspot populations with a history of persistence, but >90 % of the host plants in these populations had initiated new leaves within the first few weeks of post-diapause larval feeding. Conversely, host plants in recently extinct and unsuccessfully reintroduced populations were severely diseased, >66 % mean foliage necrosis/plant, and <23 % had initiated new leaves. Feeding choice trials with 25 larvae indicated that new leaves were strongly and consistently preferred by post-diapause larvae over all other available leaf types, both diseased and non-diseased. Because the influence of disease on post-diapause larval food resources is developmentally disassociated from oviposition, P. plantaginis invasion appears to have triggered an evolutionary trap for Plantago-dependent populations of Taylor's checkerspot.																	1387-3547	1573-1464				DEC	2016	18	12					3623	3633		10.1007/s10530-016-1253-8								WOS:000388579500019

The effect of winter length on survival and duration of dormancy of four sympatric species of Rhagoletis exploiting plants with different fruiting phenology	BULLETIN OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH												Dormancy has been thoroughly studied for several species of economic importance in the genus Rhagoletis in temperate areas of North America and Europe. Much less is known on life history regulation for species inhabiting high-elevation areas in the subtropics at the southern extreme of their geographical range. Host plant phenology has been found to play a key role in generating allochronic isolation among sibling species and host races of Rhagoletis in the course of sympatric speciation, and has important implications for pest management. We compare the effect of winter length on survival to adult eclosion and dormancy duration among four species of Rhagoletis (three of them sympatric) exploiting hosts with different fruiting phenology in subtropical isolated highlands. Survival and duration of dormancy was found to be different among the four species. At 24 degrees C, a very small proportion (<1%) of R. pomonella, R. turpiniae and R. zoqui completed development without becoming dormant, while in the case of R. solanophaga the majority of the population emerged after development within 40 days of pupation. Also, a large proportion of braconid parasitoids infesting Rhagoletis eggs and larvae emerged as adults without becoming dormant. Greatest survival after artificial winter was obtained for R. pomonella (50-60%) and R. zoqui (30%) after only four weeks at 5 degrees C (a third of the time reported for studies on northern R. pomonella), while R. turpiniae, under identical environmental conditions experienced low adult emergence, and highest survival (11%) was recorded for flies exposed to 5 degrees C during 10 and 12 weeks. For R. pomonella, there was a strong positive relationship between winter length and time to post-winter adult eclosion that was not observed for R. zoqui. In sum, for R. pomonella, mild winters in highland subtropical areas appear to select for flies better able to withstand longer periods of warm temperature before winter than flies exploiting late fruiting hosts and inhabiting northern latitudes. In the case of R. turpiniae and R. zoqui environmental cues such as fluctuations in humidity and/or different temperature thresholds (5 degrees C) may play a more important role than winter length in life history regulation. Continuous host availability for R. solanophaga appears to have selected for non-diapausing flies. From an applied perspective our results are useful for handling flies in the laboratory to conduct research and suggest that non-diapausing strains of flies and parasitoids may be selected for SIT and innundative biological control programs.

Effects of photoperiod on population performance and sexually dimorphic responses in two major arbovirus mosquito vectors, Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae)	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TROPICAL INSECT SCIENCE												The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus (Skuse) and the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus) are medically important species that vector several arboviruses. Globally, populations of both species experience (and are sensitive to) photoperiodic variations. The present study aims to test if photoperiod regimes affect the population performance of Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti. Since mosquitoes have sex-specific strategies to maximize fitness, we also tested the hypothesis that Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti would exhibit differences in the male and female response (sexually dimorphic response) to various photoperiod treatments. We reared cohorts of first instar larvae to adulthood in three photoperiod treatments: short day (10 h light), control (12 h light) and long day (14 h light). We measured and compared survival to adulthood, population growth, development time of males and females, and wing length across treatments. Although we detected no effects of photoperiod on the population performance of both species, we found evidence of a sexual dimorphic response to photoperiod in Ae. albopictus, but not in Ae. aegypti, with Ae. albopictus females being more sensitive to variations in photoperiod. The observed differences between sexes of Ae. albopictus are consistent with sex-specific developmental constraints. The absence of a sexually dimorphic response to photoperiod in Ae. aegypti can be attributed to different strategies evolved in this species to prepare for unfavourable conditions associated with shorter day length. We discuss the ecological and medical implications of our findings.																	1742-7584	1742-7592				DEC	2016	36	4					177	187		10.1017/S1742758416000163								WOS:000387903300003

The free running period (FRP) of the clock, however, is usually only close tonot exactly24 h. Here, we explored the geographical variation in the FRP of the linden bug, Pyrrhocoris apterus, in 59 field-lines originating from a wide variety of localities representing geographically different environments. We have identified a remarkable range in the FRPs between field-lines, with the fastest clock at similar to 21 h and the slowest close to 28 h, a range comparable to the collections of clock mutants in model organisms. Similarly, field-lines differed in the percentage of rhythmic individuals, with a minimum of 13.8% and a maximum of 86.8%. Although the FRP correlates with the latitude and perhaps with the altitude of the locality, the actual function of this FRP diversity is currently unclear. With the recent technological progress of massive parallel sequencing and genome editing, we can expect remarkable progress in elucidating the genetic basis of similar geographic variants in P. apterus or in similar emerging model species of chronobiology.

In species occurring over broad habitat ranges, both the timing and the intensity of diapause induction can vary across populations, revealing patterns of local adaptation. Understanding the genetic architecture of this fitness-related trait would help clarify how populations adapt to their local environments. In the cyclical parthenogenetic crustacean Daphnia magna, diapause induction is a phenotypic plastic life history trait linked to sexual reproduction, as asexual females have the ability to switch to sexual reproduction and produce resting stages, their sole strategy for surviving habitat deterioration. We have previously shown that the induction of resting stage production correlates with changes in photoperiod that indicate the imminence of habitat deterioration and have identified a Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) responsible for some of the variation in the induction of resting stages. Here, new data allows us to anchor the QTL to a large scaffold and then, using a combination of a new mapping panel, targeted association mapping and selection analysis in natural populations, to identify candidate genes within the QTL. Our results show that variation in a rhodopsin photoreceptor gene plays a significant role in the variation observed in resting stage induction. This finding provides a mechanistic explanation for the link between diapause and day-length perception that has been suggested in diverse arthropod taxa.

Differences in the reproductive biology and diapause of two congeneric species of egg parasitoids (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) from northeast Asia: Implications for biological control of the invasive emerald ash borer (Coleoptera: Buprestidae)	BIOLOGICAL CONTROL												The emerald ash borer Agrilus planipennis (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) is a serious invasive pest that has killed millions of North American ash (Fraxinus spp.) trees in the United States and Canada since its first detection in 2002. Oobius primorskyensis Yao and Duan and Oobius agrili Zhang and Huang (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) constitute a cryptic species complex of egg parasitoids attacking A. planipennis in their native range of northeast Asia. While O. primorskyensis is currently being evaluated in quarantine for potential biocontrol introduction against A. planipennis to the U. S., O. agrili has established populations in some areas of the U.S. since its first introduction in 2007. In the present study, we quantify and compare the survivorship, fecundity and progeny diapause between O. primorskyensis and O. agrili for both diapaused and non-diapaused types. Both parasitoid species were reared in the laboratory with fresh A. planipennis eggs at 25 +/- 1 degrees C, approximate to 65% RH, and 16: 8 h L: D photoperiod. Results of the study demonstrate that there are distinctive differences in the reproductive biology and progeny diapause pattern between the two parasitoid species as well as between diapaused and non-diapaused types within each species. Adults of diapaused O. primorskyensis had significantly longer longevity and produced significantly more progeny over their lifetime than diapaused adult O. agrili. Although there was no significant difference in their longevity, adults of the non-diapaused O. priomorskyensis produced significantly less progeny than those of non-diapaused O. agrili. While a majority (> 64%) of the progeny produced by diapaused O. primorskyensis and both diapaused and non-diapaused O. agrili continued development to adults, nearly 100% of the progeny from non-diapaused O. primorskyensis entered diapause. These findings suggest that the effectiveness of O. priomorskyensis and O. agrili in classical biocontrol of A. planipennis may vary in different regions of North America, where the host phenology in adult emergence and oviposition may differ. Our study indicates that O. priomorskyensis and O. agrili may be complementary to each other in biocontrol of A. planipennis in regions where both species can be successfully established.

J	Vaze, KM; Helfrich-Forster, C				Vaze, Koustubh M.; Helfrich-Foerster, Charlotte			Drosophila ezoana uses an hour-glass or highly damped circadian clock for measuring night length and inducing diapause	PHYSIOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												Insects inhabiting the temperate zones measure seasonal changes in day or night length to enter the overwintering diapause. Diapause induction occurs after the duration of the night exceeds a critical night length (CNL). Our understanding of the time measurement mechanisms is continuously evolving subsequent to Bunning's proposal that circadian systems play the clock role in photoperiodic time measurement (Bunning, 1936). Initially, the photoperiodic clocks were considered to be either based on circadian oscillators or on simple hour-glasses, depending on positive' or negative' responses in Nanda-Hamner and Bunsow experiments (Nanda & Hammer, 1958; Bunsow, 1960). However, there are also species whose responses can be regarded as neither positive', nor as negative', such as the Northern Drosophila species Drosophila ezoana, which is investigated in the present study. In addition, modelling efforts show that the positive' and negative' Nanda-Hamner responses can also be provoked by circadian oscillators that are damped to different degrees: animals with highly sustained circadian clocks will respond positive' and those with heavily damped circadian clocks will respond negative'. In the present study, an experimental assay is proposed that characterizes the photoperiodic oscillators by determining the effects of non-24-h light/dark cycles (T-cycles) on critical night length. It is predicted that there is (i) a change in the critical night length as a function of T-cycle period in sustained-oscillator-based clocks and (ii) a fixed night-length measurement (i.e. no change in critical night length) in damped-oscillator-based clocks. Drosophila ezoana flies show a critical night length of approximately 7 h irrespective of T-cycle period, suggesting a damped-oscillator-based photoperiodic clock. The conclusion is strengthened by activity recordings revealing that the activity rhythm of D. ezoana flies also dampens in constant darkness.

Facilitates Near Future Establishment at Northern Latitudes	PLOS ONE												The invasive weed Ambrosia artemisiifolia (common ragweed) constitutes a great threat to public health and agriculture in large areas of the globe. Climate change, characterized by higher temperatures and prolonged vegetation periods, could increase the risk of establishment in northern Europe in the future. However, as the species is a short-day plant that requires long nights to induce bloom formation, it might still fail to produce mature seeds before the onset of winter in areas at northern latitudes characterized by short summer nights. To survey the genetic variation in flowering time and study the effect of latitudinal origin on this trait, a reciprocal common garden experiment, including eleven populations of A. artemisiifolia from Europe and North America, was conducted. The experiment was conducted both outside the range limit of the species, in Sweden and within its invaded range, in Croatia. Our main hypothesis was that the photoperiodic-thermal requirements of A. artemisiifolia constitute a barrier for reproduction at northern latitudes and, thus, halts the northern range shift despite expected climate change. Results revealed the presence of a north-south gradient in flowering time at both garden sites, indicating that certain European populations are pre-adapted to photoperiodic and thermal conditions at latitudes up to, at least, 60 degrees N. This was confirmed by phenological recordings performed in a region close to the northern range limit, the north of Germany. Thus, we conclude that there exists a high risk for establishment and spread of A. artemisiifolia in FennoScandinavia in the near future. The range shift might occur independently of climate change, but would be accelerated by it.																	1932-6203					NOV 15	2016	11	11							e0166510	10.1371/journal.pone.0166510								WOS:000387794600073	27846312

They have been proposed to play roles in the first line of defence against various stresses in an ATP-independent manner. In birds, a newly oviposited blastoderm can survive several weeks in a dormant state in low-temperature storage suggesting that blastoderm cells are basically tolerant of environmental stress. However, sHSPs in the stress-tolerant blastoderm have yet to be investigated. Thus, we characterised the expression and function of sHSPs in the chicken blastoderm. We found that chicken HSP25 was expressed especially in the blastoderm and was highly upregulated during low-temperature storage. Multiple alignments, phylogenetic trees, and expression in the blastoderms of Japanese quail and zebra finch showed homologues of HSP25 were conserved in other avian species. After knockdown of chicken HSP25, the expression of pluripotency marker genes decreased significantly. Furthermore, loss of function studies demonstrated that chicken HSP25 is associated with anti-apoptotic, anti-oxidant, and pro-autophagic effects in chicken blastoderm cells. Collectively, these results suggest avian HSP25 could play an important role in association with the first line of cellular defences against environmental stress and the protection of future embryonic cells in the avian blastoderm.

Comparative physiological plasticity to desiccation in distinct populations of the malarial mosquito Anopheles coluzzii	PARASITES & VECTORS												Background: In West Africa, populations of the malaria vector mosquito, Anopheles coluzzii, are seasonally exposed to strong desiccating conditions during the dry season. Their dynamics strictly follows the pace of the availability of suitable larval development sites (water collections). Accordingly, mosquitoes can reproduce all year long where permanent breeding is possible, or stop reproduction and virtually disappear at the onset of the dry season when surface water dries up, like observed in temporary habitats of dry savannah areas. This highlights the strong adaptive abilities of this mosquito species, which relies at least in part, upon physiological and molecular mechanisms of specific signatures. Methods: Here, we analysed a range of physiological and molecular responses expressed by geographically different populations of An. coluzzii inhabiting permanent and temporary breeding sites from the north and the south-west of Burkina Faso. Four mosquito colonies, namely (i) Oursi, built from females breeding in permanent habitats of the north; (ii) Deou, from temporary northern habitats; (iii) Soumousso from south-western temporary breeding sites; and (iv) Bama, from permanent habitats of the same south-western zone, were reared in climatic chambers under contrasted environmental conditions, mimicking temperature, relative humidity and light regimen occurring in northern Burkina Faso. Female mosquitoes were analysed for the seasonal variation in their amounts of proteins, triglycerides and free-circulating metabolites. The expression level of genes coding for the adipokinetic (AKH-I) and the AKH/corazonin-related peptides (ACP) were also assessed and compared among populations and environmental conditions. Results: Our analysis did not reveal an apparent pattern of physiological and molecular variations strictly correlated with either the larval ecotype or the geographical origin of the mosquitoes. However, specific distinct responses were observed among populations, suggesting that dry season survival may rely on more complex ecological parameters at a micro-habitat scale. Interestingly, the physiological and molecular data support the hypothesis that different aestivation abilities exist among populations of An. coluzzii inhabiting contrasted ecological settings. In particular, the striking metabotypes differentiation and the AKH mRNA expression level observed in females from temporary northern populations may suggest the existence of a "strong" aestivation strategy in these specimens. Conclusion: Our work provides insights into the physiological and molecular basis of dry and rainy season responses in An. coluzzii, and highlights the important diversity of the mechanisms involved. Such results represent key data for understanding the ecophysiological mechanisms underpinning the strong adaptive potential of this malaria vector species, which undoubtedly contributes to the spreading of mosquito distribution areas in space and time.

Reproductive phenology of the American Bullfrog in subtropical Brazil: photoperiod as a main determinant of seasonal activity	ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS												The North American bullfrog Lithobates catesbeianus continues to invade ecosystems worldwide, potentially causing population declines and even extinctions. Within its native distribution, bullfrogs show prolonged reproductive seasons and high fertility. However, data on breeding biology of bullfrogs ex-situ in invaded localities mainly comes from anecdotal reports. Understanding how invasive species are adjusting their life histories to new colonized environments is important for conservation purposes. Here we describe temporal and spatial abundance, calling activity, spawning and tadpole distribution of bullfrogs in southern Brazil. Eighteen samplings occurred during one year. The abundance of individuals was positively related to longer photoperiods and higher temperatures. Reproductive activity was also positively associated with longer photoperiods. Calling sites, spawning and tadpoles were associated with microhabitats presenting hydrophytes, which may provide shelter and thermal stability to bullfrogs. The reproductive seasonal activity of bullfrogs can be highly variable across its growing geographical range, but in subtropical Brazil it is associated with photoperiod, a highly predictable abiotic determinant. In our study area, bullfrogs presented a breeding season twice as long as that observed in some native localities. We suggest that management strategies directed to bullfrog populations must consider the habitat structures and seasonal regimes determined by each invaded environment.

Over a 9-month fruiting period, a small proportion of Solanum appendiculatum Dunal (< 10 %) was found to be infested with a single larva of Rhagoletis solanophaga (Hernandez & Frias). The average duration of R. solanophaga lifecycle (c.a. 140 days from egg laying to death of adults) exceeded the three month fruitless period. Additionally, R. solanophaga is capable of exploiting Solanaceous plants in at least two genera. These features could have selected for a non-diapausing species of Rhagoletis, a genus where most species are univoltine. Nevertheless, some individuals in the population became dormant. As other members of the genus, R. solanophaga exhibited a resource defense mating system with forced copulations and multiple mating. Both males and females could be highly promiscuous and individual mating success exhibited a wide range of outcomes. Regardless of mating success, mated females stored similar amounts of sperm in two spherical spermathecae. Long copulations were observed, perhaps functioning as a form of mate guarding with probable disadvantages for females. We outline hypotheses and opportunities for future comparative studies examining sperm competition and mate guarding.																	0892-7553	1572-8889				NOV	2016	29	6					629	642		10.1007/s10905-016-9586-9								WOS:000390254700003

Here, we investigated life history traits of the cabbage beetle, Colaphellus bowringi Baly (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), at a wide range of temperatures (16, 19, 22, 24, 26 and 28 degrees C). The larval and pupal times were significantly decreased with increasing rearing temperature and growth rate was positively correlated with temperature. However, the relationship between body size and rearing temperature in C. bowringi did not follow the temperature-size rule; both males and females reached the highest body weight at 19 degrees C. Females were significantly larger than males at all temperatures. Male pupae lost significantly more weight at metamorphosis compared to females. However, diapausing males gained significantly higher weight after feeding compared to diapausing females at higher temperatures of 22, 24, 26 and 28 degrees C. Body weight tended to decrease with increasing rearing temperature, whereas sexual size dimorphism (SSD) tended to increase with increasing rearing temperature; thus, Rensch's rule is upheld. The degree to which SSD changed with temperature varied with different development stages. SSD was lowest in pupae, highest in newly emerged adults and intermediate in diapausing adults.																	1738-2297	1748-5967				NOV	2016	46	6					337	344		10.1111/1748-5967.12184								WOS:000388609600002

Bradley			Will changes in phenology track climate change? A study of growth initiation timing in coast Douglas-fir	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Under climate change, the reduction of frost risk, onset of warm temperatures and depletion of soil moisture are all likely to occur earlier in the year in many temperate regions. The resilience of tree species will depend on their ability to track these changes in climate with shifts in phenology that lead to earlier growth initiation in the spring. Exposure to warm temperatures ('forcing') typically triggers growth initiation, but many trees also require exposure to cool temperatures ('chilling') while dormant to readily initiate growth in the spring. If warming increases forcing and decreases chilling, climate change could maintain, advance or delay growth initiation phenology relative to the onset of favorable conditions. We modeled the timing of height-and diameter-growth initiation in coast Douglas-fir (an ecologically and economically vital tree in western North America) to determine whether changes in phenology are likely to track changes in climate using data from field-based and controlled-environment studies, which included conditions warmer than those currently experienced in the tree's range. For high latitude and elevation portions of the tree's range, our models predicted that warming will lead to earlier growth initiation and allow trees to track changes in the onset of the warm but still moist conditions that favor growth, generally without substantially greater exposure to frost. In contrast, toward lower latitude and elevation range limits, the models predicted that warming will lead to delayed growth initiation relative to changes in climate due to reduced chilling, with trees failing to capture favorable conditions in the earlier parts of the spring. This maladaptive response to climate change was more prevalent for diameter-growth initiation than height-growth initiation. The decoupling of growth initiation with the onset of favorable climatic conditions could reduce the resilience of coast Douglas-fir to climate change at the warm edges of its distribution.																	1354-1013	1365-2486				NOV	2016	22	11					3712	3723		10.1111/gcb.13328								WOS:000387811300015	27104650

Elevation and latitude interact to drive life-history variation in precocial birds: a comparative analysis using galliformes	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												1. Elevational gradients provide a powerful laboratory for understanding the environmental and ecological drivers of geographic variation in avian life-history strategies. Environmental variation across elevational gradients is hypothesized to select for a trade-off of reduced fecundity (lower clutch size and/or fewer broods) for higher offspring quality (larger eggs and/or increased parental care) in higher elevation species and populations. In birds, a focus on altricial species from north temperate latitudes has prevented an evaluation of the generality of this trade-off, and how it is affected by latitude and intrinsic factors (development mode). 2. We performed a comparative analysis controlling for body size and phylogenetic relationships on a global data set of 135 galliform species to test (i) whether higher elevation precocial species have lower fecundity (smaller clutch and/or fewer broods) and invest more in offspring quality (greater egg mass) and (ii) whether latitude influences the traits involved and/or the trade-off, and (iii) to identify ecological and environmental drivers of life-history variation along elevational gradients. 3. Life-history traits showed significant interaction effects across elevation and latitude: temperate higher elevation species had smaller clutches and clutch mass, larger eggs and shorter incubation periods, whereas more tropical species had larger clutches, eggs and clutch mass, and longer incubation periods as elevation increased. Number of broods and body mass did not vary with elevation or latitude. Latitudinal gradient in clutch size was observed only for low-elevation species. 4. Significantly, an overlooked latitude-by-elevation interaction confounds our traditional view of clutch size variation across a tropical-to-temperate gradient. Across all latitudes, higher elevation species invested in offspring quality via larger eggs but support for reduced fecundity resulting from smaller clutches was found only along temperate elevational gradients; contrary to expectations, tropical high-elevation species showed increased fecundity. Variation in nest predation risk could explain differences between temperate and tropical elevational gradients, but we lack a consistent mechanism to explain why predation risk should vary in this manner. Alternatively, a resource availability hypothesis based on physical attributes that globally differ between elevation and latitude (seasonality in day length and temperature) seems more plausible.																	0021-8790	1365-2656				NOV	2016	85	6					1528	1539		10.1111/1365-2656.12570								WOS:000388354200012	27392151

In this context, we aim to contribute to a better understanding of the determinants of barley (Hordeum vulgare) frost tolerance (FRT) and consequent improvements tomarker-assisted selection (MAS). Freezing injury in a diversity panel of 121 barley genotypes with different growth habits and origins was assessed using phenotyping based on chlorophyll fluorescence (F-v/F-m) measurements to screen genetic diversity in plants at an early growth stage. The haplotypes of vernalisation and photoperiod genes were determined with PCR, and correlation analyses were done using data from 12 laboratory and field-laboratory FRT tests. Previous results of allelic combinations of VRN-H1/VRN-H2 for FRTwere confirmed with these experiments using a larger set of genotypes. The predictive power of polymorphisms in VRN-H1 intron 1 region for FRT was significantly higher than that of the VRN-H1 promoter polymorphism. The vrn-H1/vrn-H2 facultative genotypes had similar or higher FRT than vrn-H1/Vrn-H2 winter genotypes under suboptimal hardening conditions. Genes regulating long-day and short-day photoperiodic responses were significantly correlated with FRT. The most parsimonious model for prediction of FRT was based on polymorphisms in the VRN-H1 intron 1 region, VRN-H2 and PPD-H2 and explained 69% of the variation in FRT.

(Hymenoptera: Pamphiliidae) is one of the major defoliating insects of pine forests. Mass outbreaks of this species have occurred in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stands in Central Europe and in the southern parts of Eastern Europe and Siberia. Recently, the outbreak range has shifted northward and new outbreaks have been recorded in Estonia and Finland. 2 The dynamics of the supercooling capability of pre-imaginal stages of A. posticalis (eonymphs, pronymphs, pupae) collected from the soil in a pine forest on the Island of Saaremaa, Estonia, were determined. 3 The supercooling points (SCP) of overwintering eonymphs and pronymphs changed during the winter, although there were no significant differences between the mean SCPs of either larval stage on any measuring date. The mean SCPs decreased from October (-8 to -10 degrees C) to January and March (-15 to -17 degrees C) and increased once again in May (-9 to -11 degrees C). The average SCP of pupae was considerably higher (-5.3 degrees C). 4 Overwintering larvae in the soil are potentially covered by an insulating layer of forest litter, moss and snow, thus avoiding direct exposure to low temperatures. Cold-hardiness in both overwintering larval stages of A. posticalis is sufficient for successful survival during winter in the northern Baltic region. 5 At present, outbreaks of A. posticalis in higher latitudes are concentrated in milder maritime regions near the coast of the Baltic Sea, although these may expand in the future as a result of climate warming, with the sawfly possibly becoming a serious pest of pine forests of northern Europe.																	1461-9555	1461-9563				NOV	2016	18	4					432	436		10.1111/afe.12172								WOS:000385619600012

The process through which such organisms prepare their phenotype for an improved response to future stress has been termed 'priming'. however, other terms are also used for this phenomenon, especially when considering priming in different types of organisms and when referring to different stressors. Here we propose a conceptual framework for printing of stress responses in bacteria, fungi and plants winch allows comparison of priming with other terms, e.g. adaptation, acclimation, induction, acquired resistance and cross protection. We address spatial and temporal aspects of priming and highlight current knowledge about the mechanisms necessary for information storage which range from epigenetic marks to the accunmlation of (dormant.) signalling molecules. Furthermore, we outline possible patterns of primed stress responses. Finally, we link the ability of organisms to become primed for stress responses (their 'primability") with evolutionary ecology aspects and discuss which properties of an organism and its environment may favour the evolution of priming of stress responses.

Passerines may be sufficiently plastic to track temperature-mediated shifts in optimum lay date	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Projecting the fates of populations under climate change is one of global change biology's foremost challenges. Here, we seek to identify the contributions that temperature-mediated local adaptation and plasticity make to spatial variation in nesting phenology, a phenotypic trait showing strong responses to warming. We apply a mixed modeling framework to a Britain-wide spatiotemporal dataset comprising > 100 000 records of first egg dates from four single-brooded passerine bird species. The average temperature during a specific time period ( sliding window) strongly predicts spatiotemporal variation in lay date. All four species exhibit phenological plasticity, advancing lay date by 2-5 days degrees C (1). The initiation of this sliding window is delayed further north, which may be a response to a photoperiod threshold. Using clinal trends in phenology and temperature, we are able to estimate the temperature sensitivity of selection on lay date ( B), but our estimates are highly sensitive to the temporal position of the sliding window. If the sliding window is of fixed duration with a start date determined by photoperiod, we find B is tracked by phenotypic plasticity. If, instead, we allow the start and duration of the sliding window to change with latitude, we find plasticity does not track B, although in this case, at odds with theoretical expectations, our estimates of B differ across latitude vs. longitude. We argue that a model combining photoperiod and mean temperature is most consistent with current understanding of phenological cues in passerines, the results from which suggest that each species could respond to projected increases in spring temperatures through plasticity alone. However, our estimates of B require further validation.

Projected impacts of 21st century climate change on diapause in Calanus finmarchicus	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Diapause plays a key role in the life cycle of high latitude zooplankton. During diapause, animals avoid starving in winter by living in deep waters where metabolism is lower and met by lipid reserves. Global warming is therefore expected to shorten the maximum potential diapause duration by increasing metabolic rates and by reducing body size and lipid reserves. This will alter the phenology of zooplankton, impact higher trophic levels and disrupt biological carbon pumps. Here, we project the impacts of climate change on the key North Atlantic copepod Calanus finmarchicus under IPCC RCP 8.5. Potential diapause duration is modelled in relation to body size and overwintering temperature. The projections show pronounced geographic variations. Potential diapause duration reduces by more than 30% in the Western Atlantic, whereas in the key overwintering centre of the Norwegian Sea it changes only marginally. Surface temperature rises, which reduce body size and lipid reserves, will have a similar impact to deep-water changes on diapause in many regions. Because deep-water warming lags that at the surface, animals in the Labrador Sea could offset warming impacts by diapausing in deeper waters. However, the ability to control diapause depth may be limited.

Mapping Global Potential Risk of Establishment of Rhagoletis pomonella (Diptera: Tephritidae) Using MaxEnt and CLIMEX Niche Models	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY												The apple maggot, Rhagoletis pomonella (Walsh) (Diptera: Tephritidae), is a major quarantine pest of apples Malus domestica Borkhausen) in the United States. Apple maggot is found only in North America and negatively impacts the apple industry in the western United States by reducing grower access to export markets. To reduce the threat of apple maggot to export countries and to facilitate the movement of commercial apples, an assessment of potential risk of establishment of apple maggot is needed to predict which regions are suitable or unsuitable for the fly. We used a correlative niche model MaxEnt and a mechanistic model CLIMEX to model global potential risk of establishment of apple maggot. The MaxEnt model was developed by integrating apple maggot occurrences with global climatic variables. Apple (a major host of apple maggot) climatic suitability was used as an additional variable to include species interactions in the MaxEnt model. The CLIMEX model was developed using published apple maggot physiological tolerance thresholds. Both the MaxEnt and CLIMEX models correctly predicted the known distribution of apple maggot in North America, met biological expectations when projected to the world, and mostly agreed on climatic suitability worldwide for the fly. Degree-days at 6.7 A degrees C, elevation, precipitation seasonality, and apple climatic suitability were the most important predictors associated with apple maggot distribution in North America. Our results can be used to make science-based international trade decisions by policy makers, and for monitoring apple maggot potential introductions in countries where it currently does not occur.																	0022-0493	1938-291X				OCT	2016	109	5					2043	2053		10.1093/jee/tow166								WOS:000386136700011	27452001

Assessing bias and knowledge gaps on seed ecology research: implications for conservation agenda and policy	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Sampling biases permeate ecological research and result in knowledge gaps that have vital consequences for conservation planning. The consequences of knowledge gaps on species identity and distribution (the Wallacean and Linnean shortfalls, respectively) have become apparent recently, but we know little about the extent that research biases and knowledge gaps on traits that influence species' niches (the Hutchinsonian shortfall) affect conservation policy. To examine whether knowledge of species' traits based on seed ecology is geographically, phylogenetically, and ecologically biased, we retrieved research data on seed germination, seed dormancy, seed dispersal, seed banks, seed predation, and seed removal from a database of 847 papers, 1648 species, and 5322 cases. Brazil was selected as a model system for megadiverse, undersampled countries. Kernel density maps showed that research was geographically biased towards highly populated sites, with vast areas remaining historically unexplored. We also show that research was clustered into protected areas. We detected a significant positive phylogenetic bias at genus-level, indicating research concentration in few genera and lower relative bias rates for many herbaceous genera. Unexpectedly, information on seed banking was available for only 74 (3.4%) of threatened species, which suggests that information deficits are highest for species with critical needs for ex situ conservation strategies. Tree, fleshy-fruited, and biotic dispersal species were disproportionately overstudied. Our data indicate that information deficits on seed ecology preclude our ability to effectively restore ecosystems and to safeguard endangered species. We call for a systematic improvement of environmental agenda in which policy makers and scientists target sites, clades, and functional groups historically neglected. Lessons from developed countries and collaborative efforts will be important for megadiverse, underdeveloped countries to achieve the targets of international agreements that depend on seed ecology knowledge aiming to secure biological diversity and ecosystem services.

Drivers of hibernation: linking food and weather to denning behaviour of grizzly bears	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY												Climate-induced changes in the phenology of hibernation for bear species could result in altered energy budgets, reduced cub survival and fitness and increased human-bear conflicts. Using 11 years of data, we determined the amount of variation in den entry and den exit dates that could be attributed to sex and reproductive status, weather and berry availability for 15 male and 58 female grizzly bears (Ursus arctos). We estimated berry availability during autumn using a probability surface of berry productivity within the home range of 13 individuals over 3 years. Sex and reproductive status explained 22 and 14 % of the variation in den entry and den exit dates, respectively. Weather did not influence the timing of den entry but berry availability in autumn explained 39 % of the variation observed in den entry, and high berry availability was associated with late den entry. Elevation and spring temperatures, and elevation and winter precipitation, respectively, explained 26 and 21 % of the variation observed in den exit dates. Increasing spring average monthly maximum temperature by 4 A degrees C resulted in bears emerging from dens 10 days earlier and an increase of 1.25 m in snow precipitation delayed den exit by 1 week. We demonstrate that although the phenology of hibernation for grizzly bears depends on sex and reproductive status, den entry appears to be driven by food availability, while den exit is more linked to weather. Extended growing seasons and mild meteorological conditions should result in shorter denning periods for grizzly bears. Climate change is altering the phenology of spring green-up and the onset of winter, disrupting the seasonal behaviours of species. Climate change can act as an additional strain on threatened populations, especially during energetically demanding periods such as hibernation. We quantified the importance of intrinsic and extrinsic factors including food availability and weather in the hibernation behaviour of grizzly bears. High berry availability was associated with late den entry, while low winter precipitation and high spring temperature resulted in early den exit. We conclude that den entry is more driven by food availability while den exit is more linked to weather. This dichotomy in factors affecting den entry and den exit has implications for the long-term conservation of grizzly bear populations because extended growing seasons and mild meteorological conditions expected under future climate conditions should result in shorter denning periods.																	0340-5443	1432-0762				OCT	2016	70	10					1745	1754		10.1007/s00265-016-2180-5								WOS:000383611100013

Diapause traits were studied by observing nymphal development and reproductive performance of adults at 18 A degrees C and three photoperiods (10:14, 12:12 and 14:10 (L:D) h). A 12 h light regime was also tested at 23 A degrees C. A 12 h photoperiod and 18 A degrees C induced reproductive diapause in 84 and 42 % of O. naivashae and O. thripoborus females, respectively. Cold tolerance of adults was measured by determining the supercooling point (SCP, the temperature at which the insect's body fluids freeze) and lethal time (LT50, the time required to kill 50 % of the population) at 0 and 5 A degrees C. All observed SCPs ranged from -21 to -17 A degrees C. Significantly lower SCP values were observed for acclimated (seven days at 10 A degrees C) O. naivashae females. LT50-values averaged 6.4 and 4.4 days at 0 A degrees C and 11.6 and 7.8 days at 5 A degrees C, for adults of O. thripoborus and O. naivashae, respectively. The findings indicate that O. naivashae is less cold tolerant and has a higher diapause incidence compared with O. thripoborus. Therefore, the latter species may have better potential for use in biological control programmes in the cooler regions of southern Africa or elsewhere.

However, inferences on behaviour and sociality have been far less frequent. Here, we investigate the complete mitochondrial genomes of extinct Late Pleistocene cave bears and middle Holocene brown bears that each inhabited multiple geographically proximate caves in northern Spain. In cave bears, we find that, although most caves were occupied simultaneously, each cave almost exclusively contains a unique lineage of closely related haplotypes. This remarkable pattern suggests extreme fidelity to their birth site in cave bears, best described as homing behaviour, and that cave bears formed stable maternal social groups at least for hibernation. In contrast, brown bears do not show any strong association of mitochondrial lineage and cave, suggesting that these two closely related species differed in aspects of their behaviour and sociality. This difference is likely to have contributed to cave bear extinction, which occurred at a time in which competition for caves between bears and humans was likely intense and the ability to rapidly colonize new hibernation sites would have been crucial for the survival of a species so dependent on caves for hibernation as cave bears. Our study demonstrates the potential of ancient DNA to uncover patterns of behaviour and sociality in ancient species and populations, even those that went extinct many tens of thousands of years ago.

Supercooling points of diapausing forest tent caterpillar (Lepidoptera: Lasiocampidae) eggs	CANADIAN ENTOMOLOGIST												Forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria Hubner; Lepidoptera: Lasiocampidae) is a widely distributed defoliator that undergoes intermittent outbreaks. It overwinters as pharate larvae within egg bands, is univoltine, and experiences low winter temperatures in its northern range. Little is known about how low temperatures affect winter survival and cold tolerances, their cold tolerance strategy, or how cold tolerances may vary over time and among populations. We evaluated supercooling points (SCPs) from four populations of M. disstria eggs collected along a 552 km latitudinal gradient from southern Wisconsin to northern Minnesota, United States of America. To test for potential effects of winter environment, we also administered three overwintering regimes (Madison, Wisconsin; Cloquet, Minnesota; Ely, Minnesota). Supercooling points were recorded in November, February, and March of 2011-2012. Supercooling points varied with maternal source (egg band), time of winter season, population source, and overwintering treatment. Means ranged from -26.8 degrees C (+/- 0.5 degrees C) to -40.3 degrees C (+/- 0.3 degrees C), accordingly. In a separate laboratory experiment, 89% of pharate larvae held at -20 degrees C (18.3 degrees C above coolest mean SCP) survived, but none held at -45 degrees C (6.7 degrees C below lowest mean SCP) survived. This relatively high degree of cold tolerance in its overwintering stage, due to freeze avoidance, may partially explain survival patterns and limits of overwintering M. disstria in northern populations.																	0008-347X	1918-3240				OCT	2016	148	5					512	519		10.4039/tce.2015.88								WOS:000384324100002						
J	Gersten, A; Hahn, S				Gersten, Anna; Hahn, Steffen			Timing of migration in Common Redstarts (Phoenicurus phoenicurus) in relation to the vegetation phenology at residence sites	JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												Timing the annual cycle according to local conditions is crucial for animals in seasonal environments, because individual resource requirements must match seasonal resource availabilities. Pre-nuptial spring migration is especially time constrained in many migratory species, and thus tight adjustments of departure and arrival times to local environmental conditions can be expected. We determined non-breeding residences of Common Redstarts, an insectivorous Palearctic-African migrant, from a central European population. Non-breeding residencies of three out of four males were located in the northern Sahel of West-Africa; a single individual did not cross the Sahara desert, but spent the non-breeding season in Northern Africa instead. Additionally, we related local vegetation phenology and the timing of spring migration in a central and a northern European population differing largely in breeding site latitude. The arrival at and departure from the African sites was similar in birds from the central and the northern population. Departure from the non-breeding sites was not related to seasonal deterioration of vegetation. Birds from both populations arrived at their distant breeding grounds in the same time period. Since spring green-up times differed greatly, birds from the two populations encounter different phenological conditions at arrival. The missing relation between vegetation phenology and migration timing may indicate that spring migration in redstarts is triggered by other factors than vegetation development at least at the non-breeding sites. A general cue such as local photoperiod might be the candidate factor, which would also explain the small variation between the populations.																	0021-8375	1439-0361				OCT	2016	157	4					1029	1036		10.1007/s10336-016-1359-x								WOS:000382944500010

At the times of equinoxes and solstices during the year (n = 4 per year) corresponding to different LHSs, we measured the volumetric changes and expression of doublecortin (DCX; an endogenous marker of the neuronal recruitment) in the song-control nuclei and higher order auditory forebrain regions of the subtropical resident Indian weaverbirds (Ploceus philippinus) and Palearctic-Indian migratory redheaded buntings (Emberiza bruniceps). Area X in basal ganglia, lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium (LMAN), HVC (proper name), and robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA) were enlarged during the breeding LHS. Both round and fusiform DCX-immunoreactive (DCX-ir) cells were found in area X and HVC but not in LMAN or RA, with a significant seasonal difference. Also, as shown by increase in volume and by dense, round DCX-ir cells, the neuronal incorporation was increased in HVC alone during the breeding LHS. This suggests differences in the response of song-control nuclei to photoperiod-induced changes in LHSs. Furthermore, DCX immunoreactivity indicated participation of the cortical caudomedial nidopallium and caudomedial mesopallium in the song-control system, albeit with differences between the weaverbirds and the buntings. Overall, these results show seasonal neuronal plasticity in the song-control system closely associated with annual reproductive LHS in both of the songbirds. Differences between species probably account for the differences in the photoperiod-response system between the relative refractory weaverbirds and absolute refractory redheaded buntings.

Inevitability and containment of replication errors for eukaryotic genome lengths spanning megabase to gigabase	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												The replication of DNA is initiated at particular sites on the genome called replication origins (ROs). Understanding the constraints that regulate the distribution of ROs across different organisms is fundamental for quantifying the degree of replication errors and their downstream consequences. Using a simple probabilistic model, we generate a set of predictions on the extreme sensitivity of error rates to the distribution of ROs, and how this distribution must therefore be tuned for genomes of vastly different sizes. As genome size changes from megabases to gigabases, we predict that regularity of RO spacing is lost, that large gaps between ROs dominate error rates but are heavily constrained by the mean stalling distance of replication forks, and that, for genomes spanning similar to 100 megabases to similar to 10 gigabases, errors become increasingly inevitable but their number remains very small (three or less). Our theory predicts that the number of errors becomes significantly higher for genome sizes greater than similar to 10 gigabases. We test these predictions against datasets in yeast, Arabidopsis, Drosophila, and human, and also through direct experimentation on two different human cell lines. Agreement of theoretical predictions with experiment and datasets is found in all cases, resulting in a picture of great simplicity, whereby the density and positioning of ROs explain the replication error rates for the entire range of eukaryotes for which data are available. The theory highlights three domains of error rates: negligible (yeast), tolerable (metazoan), and high (some plants), with the human genome at the extreme end of the middle domain.				Blow, J.

Escape to Ferality: The Endoferal Origin of Weedy Rice from Crop Rice through De-Domestication	PLOS ONE												Domestication is the hallmark of evolution and civilization and harnesses biodiversity through selection for specific traits. In regions where domesticated lines are grown near wild relatives, congeneric sources of aggressive weedy genotypes cause major economic losses. Thus, the origins of weedy genotypes where no congeneric species occur raise questions regarding management effectiveness and evolutionary mechanisms responsible for weedy population success. Since eradication in the 1970s, California growers avoided weedy rice through continuous flood culture and zero-tolerance guidelines, preventing the import, presence, and movement of weedy seeds. In 2003, after decades of no reported presence in California, a weedy rice population was confirmed in dry-seeded fields. Our objectives were to identify the origins and establishment of this population and pinpoint possible phenotypes involved. We show that California weedy rice is derived from a different genetic source among a broad range of AA genome Oryzas and is most recently diverged from O. sativa temperate japonica cultivated in California. In contrast, other weedy rice eco-types in North America (Southern US) originate from weedy genotypes from China near wild Oryza, and are derived through existing crop-wild relative crosses. Analyses of morphological data show that California weedy rice subgroups have phenotypes like medium-grain or gourmet cultivars, but have colored pericarp, seed shattering, and awns like wild relatives, suggesting that reversion to non-domestic or wild-like traits can occur following domestication, despite apparent fixation of domestication alleles. Additionally, these results indicate that preventive methods focused on incoming weed sources through contamination may miss burgeoning weedy genotypes that rapidly adapt, establish, and proliferate. Investigating the common and unique evolutionary mechanisms underlying global weed origins and subsequent interactions with crop relatives sheds light on how weeds evolve and addresses broader questions regarding the stability of selection during domestication and crop improvement.

An Intronic Polymorphism in couch potato Is Not Distributed Clinally in European Drosophila melanogaster Populations nor Does It Affect Diapause Inducibility	PLOS ONE												couch potato (cpo) encodes an RNA binding protein that has been reported to be expressed in the peripheral and central nervous system of embryos, larvae and adults, including the major endocrine organ, the ring gland. A polymorphism in the D. melanogaster cpo gene coding region displays a latitudinal cline in frequency in North American populations, but as cpo lies within the inversion In(3R)Payne, which is at high frequencies and itself shows a strong cline on this continent, interpretation of the cpo cline is not straightforward. A second downstream SNP in strong linkage disequilibrium with the first has been claimed to be primarily responsible for the latitudinal cline in diapause incidence in USA populations. Here, we investigate the frequencies of these two cpo SNPs in populations of Drosophila throughout continental Europe. The advantage of studying cpo variation in Europe is the very low frequency of In(3R)Payne, which we reveal here, does not appear to be clinally distributed. We observe a very different geographical scenario for cpo variation from the one in North America, suggesting that the downstream SNP does not play a role in diapause. In an attempt to verify whether the SNPs influence diapause we subsequently generated lines with different combinations of the two cpo SNPs on known timeless (tim) genetic backgrounds, because polymorphism in the clock gene tim plays a significant role in diapause inducibility. Our results reveal that the downstream cpo SNP does not seem to play any role in diapause induction in European populations in contrast to the upstream coding cpo SNP. Consequently, all future diapause studies on strains of D. melanogaster should initially determine their tim and cpo status.

J	Lehmann, P; Margus, A; Lindstrom, L				Lehmann, Philipp; Margus, Aigi; Lindstrom, Leena			Inheritance patterns of photoperiodic diapause induction in Leptinotarsa decemlineata	PHYSIOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												Photoperiod is a reliable indicator of season and an important cue that many insects use for phenological synchronization. Undergoing range expansion insects can face a change in the local photoperiod to which they need to resynchronize. Rapid range expansion can be associated with rapid photoperiodic adaptation, which can be associated with intense selection on strongly heritable polygenic traits. Alternatively, it is proposed that, in insects with an XO sex-determination system, genes with large effect residing on the sex chromosome could drive photoperiodic adaptation because the gene or genes are exposed to selection in the sex carrying only a single X-chromosome. The present study seeks to understand which of these alternatives more likely explains the rapid photoperiodic adaptation in European Colorado potato beetles Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say. Diapause induction is assessed in beetles from a northern and a southern population, as well as from reciprocal hybrid crosses between the northern and southern population, when reared at an intermediate length photoperiod. The crosses within population display the expected responses, with the northern and southern populations showing high and low diapause propensity, respectively. The hybrids show intermediate responses in all studied traits. No clear difference in the responses in hybrids depending on the latitudinal origin of their father or mother is detected, even though partial paternal line dominance is seen in the responses of male beetles in one hybrid cross. These results therefore indicate that, in L. decemlineata, photoperiodic diapause induction is strongly heritable, and has an additive polygenic autosomal background.

J	Hesse, L; Falk, JM; Koch, K				Hesse, Lisa; Falk, Joach M.; Koch, Kamilla			Inflexible versus flexible: the influence of temperature and photoperiod on pre- and post-eyespot development time in Libellulidae (Odonata)	PHYSIOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												Temperature and photoperiod are important environmental parameters for organisms. The present study tests the hypothesis that, during embryogenesis, temperature and photoperiod influence pre- and post-eyespot development time in dragonflies of the family Libellulidae differently. Eggs are used from eight species ( five different genera, from Africa/Europe, and lentic/lotic habitat preferences). The eggs are reared under different constant or fluctuating temperature and light conditions. There are no general species-specific degree-days for pre- or the post-eyespot development in these species. In all study species, the variance within and between the treatments of the duration in days and the degree-days of pre-eyespot development is lower than that of post-eyespot development. Pre-eyespot development appears to be less flexible in its reaction to environmental influences. By contrast, post-eyespot development appears to react more flexibly to environmental influences. All eight species show the same pattern. This indicates strongly that this flexibility is a general pattern in Libellulidae that might help the species within this family to cope successfully with variations in environmental conditions. Because eyespot development and katatrepsis occur close to each other, the above-described pattern might also appear in other odonates and in other insect groups that exhibit katatrepsis. For all of them, it is essential for survival to match the time of hatching with adequate external temperature and photoperiodic conditions.																	0307-6962	1365-3032				SEP	2016	41	3					224	233		10.1111/phen.12146								WOS:000386940600006						
J	Lenz, A; Hoch, G; Korner, C; Vitasse, Y				Lenz, Armando; Hoch, Gunter; Korner, Christian; Vitasse, Yann			Convergence of leaf-out towards minimum risk of freezing damage in temperate trees	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												1. Within the same forest stand, temperate deciduous trees generally exhibit a distinct pattern in leaf-out timing, with some species flushing earlier than other species. This study aimed to explain the timing of leaf-out of various temperate tree species in relation to the risk of freezing damage to leaves. 2. We combined long-term series of leaf-out date (14-32 years) of five temperate tree species located in both low and high elevations in Switzerland, daily minimum temperatures recorded at the same sites and species-specific freezing resistance (LT50) of emerging leaves. We calculated temperature safety margins (the temperature difference between absolute minimum temperature during leaf-out and species-specific LT50 values), and date safety margins (time lag between the last day when temperature falls below species-specific LT50 values and the date of leaf-out). 3. Leaf-out occurred when the probability to encounter freezing damage approaches zero, irrespective of climatic conditions (low vs. high elevation) and species (early-and late-flushing species). In other words, trees leaf out precisely at the beginning of the probabilistically safe period. Interestingly, the temperature safety margins did not differ significantly between low and high elevation. Yet, the date safety margin was smaller at high elevation, presumably due to a faster increase in temperature during the leaf-out period at high elevation. 4. When species-specific freezing resistance is taken into account, the time of leaf-out converges among species towards a marginal risk of freezing damage. Thus, leaf-out time has likely evolved in a way that the risk of freezing damage is minimized over a large spectrum of climatic conditions. Species with a small safety margin against freezing temperature, like Fagus sylvatica, appear to employ photoperiod co-control of spring phenology, whereas species with a large safety margin depend largely on temperature for the right timing of leaf-out. 5. Our results offer a new avenue to explain the differences in leaf-out timing among co-occurring tree species. They further suggest that in a warming climate, tree species can expand their distribution range to the extent their phenology matches the stochasticity of freezing temperatures in spring.

Survival and development of Amblypelta nitida Stal, A. l. lutescens Distant (Hemiptera: Coreidae) and the egg parasitoid, Anastatus sp (Hymenoptera: Eupelmidae) at constant rearing temperatures	JOURNAL OF ASIA-PACIFIC ENTOMOLOGY												The effects of constant rearing temperatures on the development and survival of Amblypelta nitida, Amblypelta lutescens lutescens (Hemiptera: Coreidae) and their egg parasitoid, Anastatus sp. (Hymenoptera: Eupelmidae), were studied in the laboratory. Amblypelta nitida and A. l. lutescens survival and development were studied at 10,15, 20, 25,30 and 35 degrees C. The development rate of both species increased linearly with increasing temperature but insects only developed to adults at 20, 25 and 30 degrees C; at these temperatures, mean development times for A. nitida were 87, 64 and 29 days and forA. l. lutescens they were 93, 65 and 31 days respectively. No eggs of either species hatched at 10 degrees C and only A l. lutescens eggs hatched at 35 degrees C At all temperatures at which insects developed beyond the first instar, mortality rates were highest in the second instar for both species. Lower developmental threshold temperatures to complete development were 15.9 degrees C and 17.1 degrees C for A. nitida and A. l. lutescens respectively; A. nitida required 421 degree-days and A.l. lutescens required 404 degree-days to complete development. Anastatus sp. completed development at all six study temperatures and development times decreased from 54 days at 17.5 degrees C to 16 days at 30 degrees C; similarly Anastatus sp, survival increased with increasing temperature. The lower developmental threshold temperature and degree-days required for Anastatus sp. to complete development were 15.0 degrees C and 234 degree-days respectively. Results are discussed with respect to the different geographical distributions of A. nitida and A. l. lutescens and likely interactions with Anastatus sp.

(Hemiptera: Aphididae) on Different Barley Varieties	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Life table parameters of the bird cherry-oat aphid, (Rhopalosiphum padi L.) were determined on different barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) varieties. Experiments were carried out under laboratory condition of 26 +/- 1 degrees C, 65 +/- 5% RH and photoperiod of 16: 8 (L:D) hours. Newborn first instar nymphs of the same age were reared on the leaves of six barley varieties using leaf cages. Nymphal development time, mortality, longevity and adult fecundity were recorded daily. Nymphal survivorship varied from 71% to 88% on the varieties tested. The results revealed significant effect of experimental varieties on demographic statistics of R. padi. The intrinsic rate of natural increase r(m), ranged between 0.318 and 0.366 female/female/day; the range of other life table parameters was from 1.37 to 1.44 day(-1) for finite rate of increase lambda, 43.83 to 60.65 female/female/generation for net Reproductive rate R-0, 1.89 to 2.17 days for Doubling Time DT and 11.19 to 11.86 days for mean generation Time T. In conclusion, analysis of biological parameters indicated Valfajr and Fajr30 as relatively less susceptible varieties to R. padi, while Reihan03, Kavir and Zarjow were considered as relatively more susceptible and Nosrat was placed in the same statistical group with other varieties.																	1680-7073					SEP-AUG	2016	18	5					1257	1266										WOS:000384252800009

Ecology and Conservation of the Endangered Legume Crotalaria avonensis in Florida Scrub	SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST												We collected data from 1998 to 2014 to describe the ecology of the highly endangered Florida scrub plant Crotalaria avonensis (Avon Park Harebells), and herein address several hypotheses based on what was known of its biology and the biology of co-occurring species. This perennial herbaceous legume occurs at 3 sites and prefers microsites with more cover by bare sand than vegetation. The population at an unprotected site has declined in size, but dynamics have been more stable at the 2 protected sites. Marked plants have shown high survival, slow and inconsistent growth, and occasional plant dormancy (usually 1-2 years). Avon Park Harebells is reproductively challenged, with very low rates of fruit set and infrequent visitation by required pollinators. The hardseeded fruits germinated at a rate of 13-56%; the germination speed seemed to increase after scarification, though the overall rate was less than for unscarified seeds. Unscarified seeds remained viable in the seed bank for at least 3 years. Seedlings recruited rarely, had moderate survival, began flowering at 4 years of age or later, and reached the size of median adult plants in 6-8 years. Herbivores affected 7-53% of plants in a given year, but plants showed rapid compensatory resprouting. Caging plants reduced herbivory and increased survival, growth, and flowering. Plants resprouted after fire and mechanical disturbance and exhibited high survival and growth, but repeated disturbances by vehicles caused increased mortality. Avon Park Harebells remains extremely endangered due to its limited range, small population sizes, and poor seedling recruitment. To help this species recover, we recommend fire management, protection from herbivory, introductions and augmentations, and further study of its pollination biology.																	1528-7092	1938-5412				SEP	2016	15	3					549	574		10.1656/058.015.0318								WOS:000384448300018						
J	Loman, J				Loman, Jon			Breeding phenology in Rana temporaria. Local variation is due to pond temperature and population size	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Frog breeding phenology in temperate zones is usually compared to progress of spring temperatures at a regional scale. However, local populations may differ substantially in phenology. To understand this, local climate and other aspects must be studied. In this study, breeding phenology of the common frog, Rana temporaria, in a set of ponds in southern Sweden is analyzed. There was within year a variation of up to 3 weeks in start of breeding among local populations. Water temperature was measured in the ponds, and breeding tended to be earlier in warmer ponds (surprise!). Breeding was also earlier in ponds with a large breeding congregation. Alternative reasons for these patterns are suggested and discussed. There was a large residual variation. The common frog has a wide range of acceptable wintering sites, and I hypothesize that the particular choice by a local population may explain part of this residual variation.																	2045-7758					SEP	2016	6	17					6202	6209		10.1002/ece3.2356								WOS:000383362700015	27648237

Testosterone, migration distance, and migratory timing in song sparrows Melospiza melodia	HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR												In seasonally migratory animals, migration distance often varies substantially within populations such that individuals breeding at the same site may overwinter different distances from the breeding grounds. Shorter migration may allow earlier return to the breeding grounds, which may be particularly advantageous to males competing to acquire a breeding territory. However, little is known about potential mechanisms that may mediate migration distance. We investigated naturally-occurring variation in androgen levels at the time of arrival to the breeding site and its relationship to overwintering latitude in male and female song sparrows (Melospiza melodia). We used stable isotope analysis of hydrogen (delta H-2) in winter-grown claw tissue to infer relative overwintering latitude (migration distance), combined with 14 years of capture records from a long-term study population to infer the arrival timing of males versus females. Relative to females, males had higher circulating androgen levels, migrated shorter distances, and were more likely to be caught early in the breeding season. Males that migrate short distances may benefit from early arrival at the breeding grounds, allowing them to establish a breeding territory. Even after controlling for sex and date, androgen levels were highest in individuals that migrated shorter distances. Our findings indicate that androgens and migration distance are correlated traits within and between sexes that may reflect individual variation within an integrated phenotype in which testosterone has correlated effects on behavioral traits such as migration.

Demographic history and adaptation account for clock gene diversity in humans	HEREDITY												Circadian clocks give rise to daily oscillations in behavior and physiological functions that often anticipate upcoming environmental changes generated by the Earth rotation. In model organisms a relationship exists between several genes affecting the circadian rhythms and latitude. We investigated the allele distributions at 116 000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 25 human clock and clock-related genes from the 1000Genomes Project, and at a reference data set of putatively neutral polymorphisms. The global genetic structure at the clock genes did not differ from that observed at the reference data set. We then tested for evidence of local adaptation searching for F-ST outliers under both an island and a hierarchical model, and for significant association between allele frequencies and environmental variables by a Bayesian approach. A total of 230 SNPs in 23 genes, or 84 SNPs in 19 genes, depending on the significance thresholds chosen, showed signs of local adaptation, whereas a maximum of 190 SNPs in 23 genes had significant covariance with one or more environmental variables. Only two SNPs from two genes (NPAS2 and AANAT) exhibit both elevated population differentiation and covariance with at least one environmental variable. We then checked whether the SNPs emerging from these analyses fall within a set of candidate SNPs associated with different chronotypes or sleep disorders. Correlation of five such SNPs with environmental variables supports a selective role of latitude or photoperiod, but certainly not a major one.

In this study we used RNA sequencing to identify genes involved in adult reproductive diapause in a northern fly species, Drosophila montana. Both diapausing and non-diapausing flies were reared under a critical day length and temperature, where about half of the emerging females enter diapause enabling us to eliminate the effects of varying environmental conditions on gene expression patterns of the two types of female flies. Results RNA sequencing revealed large differences between gene expression patterns of diapausing and non-diapausing females, especially in genes involved with metabolism, fatty acid biosynthesis, and metal and nucleotide binding. Differently expressed genes included several gene groups, including myosin, actin and cytochromeP450 genes, which have been previously associated with diapause. This study also identified new candidate genes, including some involved in cuticular hydrocarbon synthesis or regulation (desat1 and desat2), and acyl-CoA Delta 11-desaturase activity (CG9747), and few odorant-binding protein genes (e.g. Obp44A). Also, several transposable elements (TEs) showed differential expression between the two female groups motivating future research on their roles in diapause. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that the adult reproductive diapause in D. montana involves changes in the expression level of a variety of genes involved in key processes (e.g.metabolism and fatty acid biosynthesis) which help diapausing females to cope with over-wintering. This is consistent with the view that diapause is a complex adaptive phenotype where not only sexual maturation is arrested, but also changes in adult physiology are required in order to survive over the winter.

J	Kivela, SM; Valimaki, P; Gotthard, K				Kivela, Sami M.; Valimaki, Panu; Gotthard, Karl			Evolution of alternative insect life histories in stochastic seasonal environments	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Deterministic seasonality can explain the evolution of alternative life history phenotypes (i.e., life history polyphenism) expressed in different generations emerging within the same year. However, the influence of stochastic variation on the expression of such life history polyphenisms in seasonal environments is insufficiently understood. Here, we use insects as a model and explore (1) the effects of stochastic variation in seasonality and (2) the life cycle on the degree of life history differentiation among the alternative developmental pathways of direct development and diapause (overwintering), and (3) the evolution of phenology. With numerical simulation, we determine the values of development (growth) time, growth rate, body size, reproductive effort, adult life span, and fecundity in both the overwintering and directly developing generations that maximize geometric mean fitness. The results suggest that natural selection favors the expression of alternative life histories in the alternative developmental pathways even when there is stochastic variation in seasonality, but that trait differentiation is affected by the developmental stage that overwinters. Increasing environmental unpredictability induced a switch to a bet-hedging type of life history strategy, which is consistent with general life history theory. Bet-hedging appeared in our study system as reduced expression of the direct development phenotype, with associated changes in life history phenotypes, because the fitness value of direct development is highly variable in uncertain environments. Our main result is that seasonality itself is a key factor promoting the evolution of seasonally polyphenic life histories but that environmental stochasticity may modulate the expression of life history phenotypes.

Timing of Breeding Determines Growth and Development in a Long-Distance Migratory Bird	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL ZOOLOGY PART A-ECOLOGICAL GENETICS AND PHYSIOLOGY												The timing of breeding can have significant consequences for adult and offspring fitness, yet our current hypotheses of seasonal timing focus on the parent perspective. When offspring survival is affected by timing of breeding, we expect to see offspring mechanisms to detect and respond to cues of seasonal timing. Avian embryos respond to photoperiod and seasonal cues during development and in this study we evaluate the influence of photoperiod and season on posthatching growth and development in Franklin's gull (Leucophaeus pipixcan). Early-and late-season chicks exposed to short and long photoperiods during development were reared under common garden conditions. Photoperiod had no effect on posthatching growth and development, but seasonal effects present in the egg (maternal egg effects or genetic) did influence posthatching growth and development. Late-season chicks grew body mass and primary flight feathers at faster rates than early-season chicks, which we hypothesize facilitates independence and readiness for migration. Growth rates are complex phenotypes and we propose a general growth model that incorporates delays in negative feedback systems regulating growth. We show that the timing of breeding programs intrinsic growth rates in offspring, which suggests that many of the metrics used to describe seasonal patterns of reproductive success may be biased.

J	Delava, E; Fleury, F; Gibert, P				Delava, Emilie; Fleury, Frederic; Gibert, Patricia			Effects of daily fluctuating temperatures on the Drosophila-Leptopilina boulardi parasitoid association	JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY												Koinobiont parasitoid insects, which maintain intimate and long-term relationships with their arthropod hosts, constitute an association of ectothermic organisms that is particularly sensitive to temperature variations. Because temperature shows pronounced natural daily fluctuations, we examined if experiments based on a constant temperature range can mask the real effects of the thermal regime on host-parasitoid interactions. The effects of two fluctuating thermal regimes on several developmental parameters of the Drosophila larval parasitoid Leptopilina boulardi were analyzed in this study. Regime 1 included a range of 16-23-16 degrees C and regime 2 included a range of 16-21-26-21-16 degrees C (mean temperature 20.1 degrees C) compared to a 20.1 degrees C constant temperature. Under an average temperature of 20.1 degrees C, which corresponds to a cold condition of L. boulardi development, we showed that the success of parasitism is significantly higher under a fluctuating temperature regime than at constant temperature. A fluctuating regime also correlated with a reduced development time of the parasitoids. In contrast, the thermal regime did not affect the ability of Drosophila to resist parasitoid infestation. Finally, we demonstrated that daily temperature fluctuation prevented the entry into diapause for this species, which is normally observed at a constant temperature of 21 degrees C. Overall, the results reveal that constant temperature experiments can produce misleading results, highlighting the need to study the thermal biology of organisms under fluctuating regimes that reflect natural conditions as closely as possible. This is particularly a major issue in host-parasitoid associations, which constitute a good model to understand the effect of climate warming on interacting species. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Zhou, XR; Gao, JC; Pang, BP				Zhou, Xiao-Rong; Gao, Jing-Chun; Pang, Bao-Ping			Effects of Temperature on the Termination of Egg Diapause and Post-Diapause Embryonic Development of Galeruca daurica (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae)	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												Galeruca daurica (Joannis) is a new pest on the grasslands of Inner Mongolia, China. It is univoltine and over-winters in the egg stage. Larvae and adults feed on the foliage of Allium plants. To assess the requirements to terminate egg diapause and subsequent effects on post-diapause development rate, eggs were held at different temperature regimes. Exposure to low temperatures was required to terminate egg diapause. Prolonged exposure (2 mo vs 1 mo) to 5 degrees C and outside ambient conditions (mean temperature: 10.5 degrees C; range: -7.1-21.6 degrees C) enhanced the termination of egg diapause. Prolonged exposure also reduced the time to egg hatch; e.g., eggs held for 2 mo versus 1 mo at 5 degrees C developed more quickly when subsequently placed at warmer temperatures. Egg hatch was observed at 17, 21, 25, and 29 degrees C, but not at 15 degrees C. Regression analysis identified 16.2 degrees C as the minimum temperature for post-diapause development. The temperature requirement to complete embryonic development (from diapause termination to egg hatch) was calculated to be 103.1 to 140.9 degree-days.																	0046-225X	1938-2936				AUG	2016	45	4					1076	1080		10.1093/ee/nvw074								WOS:000381911600037	27330147

The larval and pupal times were significantly decreased with increasing rearing temperature, and growth rate was positively correlated with temperature. The relationship between body weight and rearing temperature in O. furnacalis did not follow the temperature-size rule (TSR); all populations exhibited the highest pupal and adult weights at high temperatures or intermediate temperatures. However, development time, growth rate, and body weight did not show a constant latitudinal gradient. Across all populations at each temperature, female were significantly bigger than males, showing a female-biased sexual size dimorphism (SSD). Contrary to Rensch's rule, the SSD tended to increase with rising temperature. The subtropical GZ population exhibited the largest degree of dimorphism while the temperate LF exhibited the smallest. Male pupae lose significantly more weight at metamorphosis compared to females. The proportionate weight losses of different populations were significantly different. Adult longevity was significantly decreased with increasing temperature. Between sexes, all populations exhibit a rather female-biased adult longevity. Finally, we discuss the adaptive significance of higher temperature-inducing high body weight in the moth's life history and why the moth exhibits the reverse TSR.																	2045-7758					AUG	2016	6	15					5129	5143		10.1002/ece3.2275								WOS:000381216300003	27551371					
J	Endo, N				Endo, Nobuyuki			Effective monitoring of the population dynamics of Nezara viridula and Nezara antennata (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae) using a light trap in Japan	APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY												The southern green stink bug, Nezara viridula (L.), and its congeneric species, Nezara antennata Scott, are major agricultural pests in Japan. Here, I investigated seasonal trends in light trap capture rates, as well as female ovarian development of these two species from 2009 to 2014 in Kumamoto, Japan. Each year, both species first appeared in the traps in May, and large numbers were caught between July and August. Both mature and immature females were caught. For both species, ovarian development followed a similar seasonal pattern in 2009 and 2010, but the patterns differed between the species. The development of reproductive organs was similar to that in previous reports from wild populations, demonstrating the usefulness of light-trapped females in clarifying their life-history traits (e.g., the number of generations per year, the timing of oviposition, and timing of occurrence for each generation). The trap capture data of N. viridula until the end of July and its preceding winter temperatures were positively related. Thus, winter temperature is a useful predictor of the relative abundance of N. viridula in wild populations.																	0003-6862	1347-605X				AUG	2016	51	3					341	346		10.1007/s13355-016-0404-9								WOS:000380066300001						
J	Sniegula, S; Golab, MJ; Johansson, F				Sniegula, Szymon; Golab, Maria J.; Johansson, Frank			A large-scale latitudinal pattern of life-history traits in a strictly univoltine damselfly	ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												1. Variation in thermal conditions and season length along latitudinal gradients affect body size-related traits over different life stages. Selection is expected to optimise these size traits in response to the costs and benefits. 2. Egg, hatchling, larval and adult size in males and females were estimated along a latitudinal gradient of 2730km across Europe in the univoltine damselfly Lestes sponsa, using a combination of field-collection and laboratory-rearing experiments. In the laboratory, individuals were grown in temperatures and photoperiod simulating those at the latitude of origin, and in common-garden conditions. 3. The size of adults sampled in nature was negatively correlated with latitude. In all populations the females were larger than the males. Results from simulated and common-garden rearing experiments supported this pattern of size difference across latitudes and between sexes, suggesting a genetic component for the latitudinal size trend and female-biased size dimorphism. In contrast, hatchling size showed a positive relationship with latitude, but egg size, although differing between latitudes, showed no such relationship. 4. The results support a converse Bergmann cline, i.e. a negative body size cline towards the north. This negative cline in body size is probably driven by progressively stronger seasonal time and temperature constraints towards the higher latitudes and by the obligate univoltine life cycle of L. sponsa. As egg size showed no relationship with latitude, other environmental factors besides temperature, such as desiccation risk, probably affect this trait.

Overwintering biology and limits of cold tolerance in larvae of pistachio twig borer, Kermania pistaciella	BULLETIN OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH												Pistachio twig borer, Kermania pistaciella is an important pest of pistachio trees. It has an univoltine life-cycle and its larvae tunnel and feed inside pistachio twigs for almost 10 months each year. The last larval instars overwinter inside the twigs. Survival/mortality associated with low temperatures during overwintering stage is currently unknown. We found that overwintering larvae of the Rafsanjan (Iran) population of K. pistaciella rely on maintaining a stably high supercooling capacity throughout the cold season. Their supercooling points (SCPs) ranged between -19.4 and -22.7 degrees C from October to February. Larvae were able to survive 24 h exposures to -15 degrees C anytime during the cold season. During December and January, larvae were undergoing quiescence type of dormancy caused probably by low ambient temperatures and/or changes in host tree physiology (tree dormancy). Larvae attain highest cold tolerance (high survival at -20 degrees C) during dormancy, which offers them sufficient protection against geographically and ecologically relevant cold spells. High cold tolerance during dormancy was not associated with accumulation of any low-molecular mass cryoprotective substances. The SCP sets the limit of cold tolerance in pistachio twig borer, meaning that high mortality of overwintering populations can be expected only in the regions or years where or when the temperatures fall below the average larval SCP (i.e., below -20 degrees C). Partial mortality can be expected also when temperatures repeatedly drop close to the SCP on a diurnal basis.

Assessing phenological synchrony between the Chinese sawfly, Cephus fumipennis (Hymenoptera: Cephidae), its egg-larval parasitoid, Collyria catoptron (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae), and the North American sawfly, Cephus cinctus: implications for biological control	CANADIAN ENTOMOLOGIST												Many pest and beneficial insects overwinter as larvae in a state of diapause, with development resuming in the spring. In these cases, rates of post-diapause development of parasitoids must be synchronised with the vulnerable life stages of their hosts. Phenological asynchrony between introduced parasitoids and their targeted hosts has limited the success of some biological control efforts. Here, we assess the potential synchrony between Collyria catoptron Wahl (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae), a parasitoid of the Chinese wheat stem sawfly, Cephus fumipennis Eversmann (Hymenoptera: Cephidae), which is being considered as a biological control against a novel host species, Cephus cinctus Norton, in North America. We compared development timing and emergence patterns of both native and exotic species of sawflies with that of the parasitoid. We found that the mean number of days between termination of larval diapause and adult eclosion varied by less than one day across species, and patterns of emergence were also similar. The rate of development of this egg-larval parasitoid was within the range necessary to attack C. cinctus eggs. Furthermore, the development of C. cinctus from westernMontana, United States of Americamost closely matched that of the parasitoid, suggesting western Montana as a possible release area.																	0008-347X	1918-3240				AUG	2016	148	4					482	492		10.4039/tce.2015.64								WOS:000379601200011

In this study, a hybrid phenology detection method is presented that incorporates the "shape-model fitting" concept of the two-step filtering method and a simulation concept of the crop models to detect the critical vegetative stages and reproductive stages of corn (Zea mays L.) and soybeans (Glycine max L.) from MODIS 250-m Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index (WDRVI) time-series data and 1000-m Land Surface Temperature (LST) data. The method was first developed and tested at the field scale over a ten-year period (2003-2012) for three experimental study sites in eastern Nebraska of USA, where the estimated phenology dates were compared to the ground-based phenology observations for both corn and soybeans. The average root mean square error (RMSE) of phenology stage estimation of the individual development stages across all sites ranged from 1.9 to 43 days for corn and from 1.9 to 4.9 days for soybeans. The approach was then tested at a regional scale over eastern Nebraska and the state of Iowa to evaluate its ability to characterize the spatio-temporal variation of targeted corn and soybean phenology stage dates over a larger area. Quantitative regional assessments were conducted by comparing the estimated crop stage dates with crop developmental stage statistics reported by the USDA NASS Crop Progress Reports (NASS-CPR) for both eastern Nebraska and Iowa. The accuracy of the regional-scale phenology estimation in Iowa (RMSE ranged from 2.6 to 3.9 days for corn and from 3.2 to 3.9 days for soybeans) was slightly lower than in eastern Nebraska (RMSE ranged from 1.8 to 2.9 days for corn and from 1.7 to 2.9 days for soybeans), However, the estimation accuracy in Iowa was still reasonable with the estimated phenology dates being within 4 days or less of the observed dates for both corn and soybeans.

J	Adamsson, M; Laike, T; Morita, T				Adamsson, Mathias; Laike, Thorbjorn; Morita, Takeshi			Annual variation in daily light exposure and circadian change of melatonin and cortisol concentrations at a northern latitude with large seasonal differences in photoperiod length	Journal of Physiological Anthropology												Background: Seasonal variations in physiology and behavior have frequently been reported. Light is the major zeitgeber for synchronizing internal circadian rhythms with the external solar day. Non-image forming effects of light radiation, for example, phase resetting of the circadian rhythms, melatonin suppression, and acute alerting effects, depend on several characteristics of the light exposure including intensity, timing and duration, spectral composition and previous light exposure, or light history. The aim of the present study was to report on the natural pattern of diurnal and seasonal light exposure and to examine seasonal variations in the circadian change of melatonin and cortisol concentrations for a group of Swedish office workers. Methods: Fifteen subjects participated in a field study that was carried out in the south of Sweden. Ambulatory equipment was used for monthly measurements of the daily exposure to light radiation across the year. The measurements included illuminance and irradiance. The subjects collected saliva samples every 4 h during 1 day of the monthly measuring period. Results: The results showed that there were large seasonal differences in daily amount of light exposure across the year. Seasonal differences were observed during the time periods 04: 00-08: 00, 08: 00-12: 00, 12: 00-16: 00, 16: 00-20: 00, and 20: 00-24: 00. Moreover, there were seasonal differences regarding the exposure pattern. The subjects were to a larger extent exposed to light in the afternoon/evening in the summer. During the winter, spring, and autumn, the subjects received much of the daily light exposure in the morning and early afternoon. Regarding melatonin, a seasonal variation was observed with a larger peak level during the winter and higher levels in the morning at 07: 00. Conclusions: This study adds to the results from other naturalistic studies by reporting on the diurnal and seasonal light exposure patterns for a group living at a northern latitude of 56 degrees N, with large annual variations in photoperiod length. It seems to be seasonal variation in the lighting conditions, both concerning intensities as well as regarding the pattern of the light exposure to which people living at high latitudes are exposed which may result in seasonal variation in the circadian profile of melatonin.																	1880-6805					JUL 19	2016	36								6	10.1186/s40101-016-0103-9								WOS:000392974100001	27435153

(BRANCHIOPODA: ANOSTRACA) EGGS	JOURNAL OF CRUSTACEAN BIOLOGY					Mid-Year Meeting of the Crustacean-Society	JUL, 2015	Sydney, AUSTRALIA	Crustacean Soc				We investigated the effect of illumination on the hatching of eggs of one strain of Artemia franciscana Kellogg, 1906 and two strains of parthenogenetic Artemia (Branchiopoda, Anostraca). The following light parameters were used: colour (red, blue, and white light, having different intensities in the range 22-27 mu mol E/m(2) per s, corresponding with different wavelengths in the range 400-700 nm), and additionally (Experiment I) duration of light exposure (varying between 15 min and continuous light) or (Experiment 2) timing of light exposure (from the 1st to the 13th hour of incubation of eggs for hatching). Continuous darkness was included as negative control. Hatching percentage was determined after 24 and 48 h, and additionally after 72 h in Experiment 2. For all samples a relatively short exposure to light (6 h or less) during the initial hours of incubation maximally triggered the hatching process; I h of light had highest efficiency when given during the 4th hour of incubation of eggs for hatching, and less so when supplied earlier or later. Lower sensitivity was observed for the red light spectral region (600-700 nm), with mostly limited differences between blue (400-500 nm) and white (400-700 nm) light. Differences between samples could be linked to factors such as chorion thickness, pigmentation, storage conditions, diapause status and genotypic differences in general, but to what extent each of these factors contributes to the variability among the strains needs to be studied by analysing a more comprehensive set of samples. The fact that the inter-strain differences observed in our study were only of quantitative nature nevertheless suggests that light triggers hatching in Anemia eggs through a process that is consistent throughout the genus. Our work could contribute to a better understanding of the hatching biology of dormant life stages in Crustacea in general.																	0278-0372	1937-240X				JUL	2016	36	4					515	524		10.1163/1937240X-00002454								WOS:000387307300010

The mean +/- SD core range area (KDE50) was 15.00 +/- 22.41m(2). The home range area (KDE95) had a mean +/- SD of 429.78 +/- 510.97m(2). Shores of larger eutrophic ponds and small temporary pools in alluvial forest were chosen as habitat. The total area used (MCP95) had a mean of 11,086.73 +/- 12,239.00m(2). The study revealed a mean action radius of 270.78 +/- 199.17m and individuals moved up to 742m in a single displacement. These results show that the dispersion of the American bullfrog in a valley system such as the Grote Nete can proceed very rapidly. A positive correlation between weight and distance covered within one movement was found, which could suggest that dominant individuals are capable of covering greater distances in search of optimal habitat for reproduction, foraging or hibernation.																	0777-6276	2295-0451				JUL	2016	146	2					90	100										WOS:000385247000003

A New Species of Oobius Trjapitzin (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) From the Russian Far East That Parasitizes Eggs of Emerald Ash Borer (Coleoptera: Buprestidae)	ANNALS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												We describe a new species of egg parasitoid, Oobius primorskyensis Yao & Duan n. sp., collected from the emerald ash borer Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) near Vladivostok, Russia. Morphological and molecular analyses indicate that this taxon is sufficiently distinct from Oobius agrili Zhang & Huang 2005 to merit species status. Furthermore, DNA sequence divergence between O. primorskyensis and specimens in culture of Chinese origin suggest that O. primorskyensis is molecularly distinct from Oobius previously imported into the United Stated and released as biological control agents of emerald ash borer. Laboratory observations showed that O. primorskyensis also differs from O. agrili in diapause pattern. When reared with A. planipennis eggs at 25 +/- 1.5 degrees C, 65 +/- 10% relative humidity, and a photoperiod of 16:8 (L:D) h, nearly 100% of O. primorskyensis diapaused at the second and third generations after their parents had diapaused, whereas a majority (60-96%) of O. agrili did not diapauses for 11 sequential generations. Diagnosis of the species with respect to O. agrili is provided. The new species is a natural enemy of A. planipennis in its native range and may be considered for introduction against A. planipennis in North America.

We examined the effects of different temperatures and photoperiods on diapause induction and termination under laboratory conditions. There was variation in the ovarian development and oviposition rate under different photoperiods at 10 +/- 1 A degrees C, and the percentage of adults with immature ovaries was higher during the short photoperiod (8L:16D) than other photoperiods at 10 +/- 1 A degrees C. Adults were most sensitive to photoperiod within 3 days of eclosion. The optimal combination of photoperiod and temperature for diapause termination was a long photoperiod (16L:8D) at 25 +/- 1 A degrees C. The supercooling point was significantly reduced in reproductive diapause females, and trehalase, pyruvate kinase, sorbitol dehydrogenase, hexokinase and phosphofructokinase enzyme activities were significantly reduced (36.46, 57.85, 32.64, 54.68 and 24.59 %, respectively); glycogen and triglyceride levels were significantly increased (42.17 and 120.36 %). We conclude that D. suzukii is typical of short-day diapause species within a certain photoperiod range. This information might contribute to a more fundamental understanding of adult reproductive diapause for this important pest.																	1612-4758	1612-4766				JUL	2016	89	3			SI		679	688		10.1007/s10340-016-0760-9								WOS:000379804000008

Bud phenology and growth are subject to divergent selection across a latitudinal gradient in Populus angustifolia and impact adaptation across the distributional range and associated arthropods	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Temperate forest tree species that span large geographical areas and climatic gradients often have high levels of genetic variation. Such species are ideal for testing how neutral demographic factors and climate-driven selection structure genetic variation within species, and how this genetic variation can affect ecological communities. Here, we quantified genetic variation in vegetative phenology and growth traits in narrowleaf cottonwood, Populus angustifolia, using three common gardens planted with genotypes originating from source populations spanning the species' range along the Rocky Mountains of North America (ca. 1700 km). We present three main findings. First, we found strong evidence of divergent selection (Q(ST) > F-ST) on fall phenology (bud set) with adaptive consequences for frost avoidance. We also found evidence for selection on bud flush duration, tree height, and basal diameter, resulting in population differentiation. Second, we found strong associations with climate variables that were strongly correlated with latitude of origin. More strongly differentiated traits also showed stronger climate correlations, which emphasizes the role that climate has played in divergent selection throughout the range. We found population 9 garden interaction effects; for some traits, this accounted for more of the variance than either factor alone. Tree height was influenced by the difference in climate of the source and garden locations and declined with increasing transfer distance. Third, growth traits were correlated with dependent arthropod community diversity metrics. Synthesis. Overall, we conclude that climate has influenced genetic variation and structure in phenology and growth traits and leads to local adaptation in P. angustifolia, which can then impact dependent arthropod species. Importantly, relocation of genotypes far northward or southward often resulted in poor growth, likely due to a phenological mismatch with photoperiod, the proximate cue for fall growth cessation. Genotypes moved too far southward suffer from early growth cessation, whereas those moved too far northward are prone to fall frost and winter dieback. In the face of current and forecasted climate change, habitat restoration, forestry, and tree breeding efforts should utilize these findings to better match latitudinal and climatic source environments with management locations for optimal future outcomes.

J	Tanaka, K; Murata, K				Tanaka, Koichi; Murata, Kouhei			Rapid evolution of photoperiodic response in a recently introduced insect Ophraella communa along geographic gradients	ENTOMOLOGICAL SCIENCE												The introduced beetle Ophraella communa was first found in 1996 in Japan and has rapidly expanded its distribution to include regions that encompass a wide range of latitude and altitude and are dominated by different host-plants. In this study, we investigated geographic variation in its photoperiodic response for the induction of reproductive diapause, with which the beetle adjusts its life cycle to local climate and host-plant phenology. The beetle lines were collected from 18 sites in Japan. The diapause incidence under a photoperiodic condition of 13h light:11h dark (LD13:11) and the critical day length differed among the beetle lines. Analysis with the generalized linear model showed that latitude, altitude and host-plant species (Ambrosia artemisiifoliavs. Ambrosia trifida) had significant effects on diapause incidence under LD13:11. These results suggest that the O.communa populations have rapidly adapted to local environmental conditions after their colonization. However, the photoperiodic response of the O.communa population in Tomakomai, the northernmost part of its distribution range in Japan, deviated significantly from the general trend. We suggest that this deviation is attributed to either: (i) that this beetle has colonized Tomakomai more recently compared to the other sites; or (ii) that the Tomakomai population has adapted to local environments in a different way from other populations.																	1343-8786	1479-8298				JUL	2016	19	3					207	214		10.1111/ens.12200								WOS:000379932600007

Geographical and annual variations in the proportion of 2-yr to 1-yr type individuals of I.yukawai were studied from 1977 to 1994 and in 2008, 2009 and 2014. An analysis of geographical variation at 13 different census fields indicated that the proportion of 2-yr type individuals significantly increased with the decrease of mean annual temperature reflected by altitudinal and latitudinal gradients. However, a multiple regression analysis indicated that the annual variation in the proportion was not correlated with temperature, gall density, abundance of host resources or parasitism by hymenopteran parasitoids. Thus, we eliminated the effects of these external factors that have been thought to determine the annual variation. We need to take alternative intrinsic factors, instead of external factors, into consideration to explain the annual variation. The fall of galled leaves occasionally caused a higher mortality of 2-yr type individuals than those of 1-yr type. Nevertheless, 2-yr type individuals exist. We considered that the existence of 2-yr type individuals of I.yukawai has an adaptive significance to diversify risks against catastrophic events such as the serious shortage of host buds and high percentage of parasitism that happen more frequently than the high mortality caused by the fall of galled leaves.

We used next generation sequencing of two pools of 48 Norway spruce mother trees, one corresponding to the Fennoscandian domain, and the other to the Alpine domain, to assess nucleotide polymorphism at 88 nuclear genes. These genes are candidate genes for phenological traits, and most belong to the photoperiod pathway. Estimates of population genetic summary statistics from the pooled data are similar to previous estimates, suggesting that pooled sequencing is reliable. The nonsynonymous SNPs tended to have both lower frequency differences and lower F-ST values between the two domains than silent ones. These results suggest the presence of purifying selection. The divergence between the two domains based on synonymous changes was around 5 million yr, a time similar to a recent phylogenetic estimate of 6 million yr, but much larger than earlier estimates based on isozymes. Two approaches, one of them novel and that considers both F-ST and difference in allele frequencies between the two domains, were used to identify SNPs potentially under diversifying selection. SNPs from around 20 genes were detected, including genes previously identified as main target for selection, such as PaPRR3 and PaGI.

Control of lung ventilation following overwintering conditions in bullfrogs, Lithobates catesbeianus	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY												Ranid frogs in northern latitudes survive winter at cold temperatures in aquatic habitats often completely covered by ice. Cold-submerged frogs survive aerobically for several months relying exclusively on cutaneous gas exchangewhilemaintaining temperature-specific acid-base balance. Depending on the overwintering hibernaculum, frogs in northern latitudes could spend several months without access to air, the need to breathe or the chemosensory drive to use neuromuscular processes that regulate and enable pulmonary ventilation. Therefore, we performed experiments to determine whether aspects of the respiratory control system of bullfrogs, Lithobates catesbeianus, are maintained or suppressed following minimal use of air breathing in overwintering environments. Based on the necessity for control of lung ventilation in early spring, we hypothesized that critical components of the respiratory control systemof bullfrogs would be functional following simulated overwintering. We found that bullfrogs recently removed from simulated overwintering environments exhibited similar resting ventilation when assessed at 24 degrees C compared with warm-acclimated control bullfrogs. Additionally, ventilation met resting metabolic and, presumably, acid-base regulation requirements, indicating preservation of basal respiratory function despite prolonged disuse in the cold. Recently emerged bullfrogs underwent similar increases in ventilation during acute oxygen lack (aerial hypoxia) compared with warm-acclimated frogs; however, CO2-related hyperventilation was significantly blunted following overwintering. Overcoming challenges to gas exchange during overwintering have garnered attention in ectothermic vertebrates, but this study uncovers robust and labile aspects of the respiratory control systemat a time point correlating with early spring following minimal to no use of lung breathing in coldaquatic overwintering habitats.																	0022-0949	1477-9145				JUL	2016	219	13					2003	2014		10.1242/jeb.136259								WOS:000379366400019	27091862

Investigating dormant-season application of pheromone in citrus to control overwintering and spring populations of Phyllocnistis citrella (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae)	PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE												BACKGROUND: The leafminer, Phyllocnistis citrella Stainton, reproduces on leaf flush during winter. Deployment of pheromone during winter could suppress moth populations in spring and summer more than a spring application alone. We tested the primary pheromone component of P. citrella, (Z,Z,E)-7,11,13-hexadecatrienal, released gradually over several months from elastomeric dispensers in a citrus grove in 6.4 ha main plots in winter and/or 3.2 ha subplots in spring (834 mg triene ha(-1)) and evaluated moth catch and leaf mining. RESULTS: After winter treatment, dispensers provided >85% disruption of male moth catch in traps for 37 weeks, and after spring treatment they provided >92% disruption for 26 weeks, but there was only a 12% reduction in leaf infestation in spring. Two applications were no better than only a single application in spring. Disruption of moth catch was weaker in treated plots where traps were placed high (3.1 m) rather than low (1.6 m) in the tree canopy. CONCLUSION: Dispensers provided effective and persistent disruption of male catch in pheromone-baited monitoring traps but were minimally effective in reducing leaf infestation by P. citrella. Winter application of pheromone did not reduce leaf mining in spring compared with spring application alone. Tops of trees may have provided a refuge formating. Published 2015. This article is a U.

Population Structure in the Model Grass Brachypodium distachyon Is Highly Correlated with Flowering Differences across Broad Geographic Areas	PLANT GENOME												The small, annual grass Brachypodium distachyon (L.) Beauv., a close relative of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), is a powerful model system for cereals and bioenergy grasses. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of natural variation can elucidate the genetic basis of complex traits but have been so far limited in B. distachyon by the lack of large numbers of well-characterized and sufficiently diverse accessions. Here, we report on genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) of 84 B. distachyon, seven B. hybridum, and three B. stacei accessions with diverse geographic origins including Albania, Armenia, Georgia, Italy, Spain, and Turkey. Over 90,000 high-quality single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) distributed across the Bd21 reference genome were identified. Our results confirm the hybrid nature of the B. hybridum genome, which appears as a mosaic of B. distachyon-like and B. stacei-like sequences. Analysis of more than 50,000 SNPs for the B. distachyon accessions revealed three distinct, genetically defined populations. Surprisingly, these genomic profiles are associated with differences in flowering time rather than with broad geographic origin. High levels of differentiation in loci associated with floral development support the differences in flowering phenology between B. distachyon populations. Genome-wide association studies combining genotypic and phenotypic data also suggest the presence of one or more photoperiodism, circadian clock, and vernalization genes in loci associated with flowering time variation within B. distachyon populations. Our characterization elucidates genes underlying population differences, expands the germplasm resources available for Brachypodium, and illustrates the feasibility and limitations of GWAS in this model grass.																	1940-3372					JUL	2016	9	2								10.3835/plantgenome2015.08.0074								WOS:000379368700010

Biological Flora of the British Isles: Fraxinus excelsior	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Fraxinus excelsior L. (Ash) that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history, and conservation.Fraxinus excelsior is a large forest tree, native throughout the main islands of Britain and much of mainland Europe. Seedlings are shade tolerant, but adults are not so it tends to be an intermediate successional species, invading gaps in mixed stands rather than forming extensive pure stands. Ash grows on a wide range of soils but is commonest on nutrient-rich soils with a high base status and pH>4.2, and is at its best on dry calcareous screes and fertile alluvial soils.Fraxinus excelsior is trioecious or subdioecious with male, hermaphrodite and female flowers and trees. Seed production is prolific with periodic higher producing mast years. Seeds are primarily wind-dispersed, but they can float and be moved considerable distances along waterways. Germination is delayed by dormancy until usually the second spring after being shed. Ash is tolerant of drought, but intolerant of spring frosts and so is predicted to fare well under current climate change scenarios, and indeed has recently been expanding in range in Europe. However, ash health and survival is currently seriously compromised by ash dieback caused by the fungus Hymenoscyphus fraxineus (Chalara fraxinea) that has the potential to kill all but a very few resistant trees. Moreover, the emerald ash borer beetle Agrilus planipennis, a serious pest of ash species in N. America, has reached Europe (though not yet the British Isles) and poses an equally if not more serious long-term threat to ash.																	0022-0477	1365-2745				JUL	2016	104	4					1158	1209		10.1111/1365-2745.12566								WOS:000379015400027

Niche partitioning and biogeography of high light adapted Prochlorococcus across taxonomic ranks in the North Pacific	ISME JOURNAL												The distribution of major clades of Prochlorococcus tracks light, temperature and other environmental variables; yet, the drivers of genomic diversity within these ecotypes and the net effect on biodiversity of the larger community are poorly understood. We examined high light (HL) adapted Prochlorococcus communities across spatial and temporal environmental gradients in the Pacific Ocean to determine the ecological drivers of population structure and diversity across taxonomic ranks. We show that the Prochlorococcus community has the highest diversity at low latitudes, but seasonality driven by temperature, day length and nutrients adds complexity. At finer taxonomic resolution, some 'sub-ecotype' clades have unique, cohesive responses to environmental variables and distinct biogeographies, suggesting that presently defined ecotypes can be further partitioned into ecologically meaningful units. Intriguingly, biogeographies of the HL-I sub-ecotypes are driven by unique combinations of environmental traits, rather than through trait hierarchy, while the HL-II sub-ecotypes appear ecologically similar, thus demonstrating differences among these dominant HL ecotypes. Examining biodiversity across taxonomic ranks reveals high-resolution dynamics of Prochlorococcus evolution and ecology that are masked at phylogenetically coarse resolution. Spatial and seasonal trends of Prochlorococcus communities suggest that the future ocean may be comprised of different populations, with implications for ecosystem structure and function.

Host and parasite thermal acclimation responses depend on the stage of infection	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												Global climate change is expected to alter patterns of temperature variability, which could influence species interactions including parasitism. Species interactions can be difficult to predict in variable-temperature environments because of thermal acclimation responses, i.e. physiological changes that allow organisms to adjust to a new temperature following a temperature shift. The goal of this study was to determine how thermal acclimation influences host resistance to infection and to test for parasite acclimation responses, which might differ from host responses in important ways. We tested predictions of three, non-mutually exclusive hypotheses regarding thermal acclimation effects on infection of green frog tadpoles (Lithobates clamitans) by the trematode parasite Ribeiroia ondatrae with fully replicated controlled-temperature experiments. Trematodes or tadpoles were independently acclimated to a range of acclimation temperatures' prior to shifting them to new performance temperatures' for experimental infections. Trematodes that were acclimated to intermediate temperatures (19-22 degrees C) had greater encystment success across temperatures than either cold- or warm-acclimated trematodes. However, host acclimation responses varied depending on the stage of infection (encystment vs. clearance): warm- (22-28 degrees C) and cold-acclimated (13-19 degrees C) tadpoles had fewer parasites encyst at warm and cold performance temperatures, respectively, whereas intermediate-acclimated tadpoles (19-25 degrees C) cleared the greatest proportion of parasites in the week following exposure. These results suggest that tadpoles use different immune mechanisms to resist different stages of trematode infection, and that each set of mechanisms has unique responses to temperature variability. Our results highlight the importance of considering thermal responses of both parasites and hosts when predicting disease patterns in variable-temperature environments.																	0021-8790	1365-2656				JUL	2016	85	4					1014	1024		10.1111/1365-2656.12510								WOS:000378646800016	27040618

Assessing Den Selection and Den Characteristics of Grizzly Bears	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Hibernation has evolved as an adaptive strategy to avoid harsh environmental conditions associated with a lack of resources, and the choice of hibernacula can affect the fitness of individuals. Most habitat selection studies, including investigations of overwintering sites, are based on data collected from land inventories or remote sensing databases used in a geographic information system (GIS). Although rarely used, forest stand ecological data gathered at fine spatial scales may enhance our understanding of selection processes. Our objectives were to enhance previous GIS-based investigations of den use by grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) with field-based investigations and determine whether males and females selected dens in response to food availability, within-stand characteristics related to concealment cover, or factors affecting the structural stability of dens. We studied den selection for 10 male and 21 female grizzly bears at the home-range scale and within the den vicinity using data collected at 42 den sites, 168 adjacent sites, and 345 random locations within the Rocky Mountains and boreal forest of Alberta, Canada between 2001 and 2012. Within their autumn home range, male and female grizzly bears selected sites with greater concealment cover, greater canopy cover, and more abundant sweet-vetch (Hedysarum spp.) compared to availability. Poor model performance when comparing den sites to adjacent sites within the den vicinity suggests that male and female grizzly bears select sites at scales larger than 0.1 km. We found no difference in the dimensions and characteristics of dens excavated by males and females, nor in the structural stability of dens dug under a mature tree or in open areas, and no selection for a specific type of mineral soil or percentage of boulders and cobbles. Our results corroborate previous resource selection functions using remote sensing and land inventory data but show that home-range scale analyses can fail to assess selection of potentially influential, ecologically important within-stand characteristics such as food abundance and lateral cover. Within-stand data are typically unavailable through current habitat maps and field data can enhance our understanding of fine-scale selection. To minimize human-bear interactions and disturbances at dens, we recommend integrating field-based investigations to high-priority denning areas identified from resource selection functions, and to further improve conservation efforts, we recommend taking into account within-stand data to describe behaviors occurring during the active and inactive periods.

Ecological monitoring often uses plant community composition to infer quality of sites but conventional aboveground surveys only capture a snapshot of the actively growing plant diversity. Environmental DNA (eDNA) extracted from soil samples, however, can include taxa represented by both active and dormant tissues, seeds, pollen, and detritus. Analysis of this eDNA through DNA metabarcoding provides a more comprehensive view of plant diversity at a site from a single assessment but it is not clear which DNA markers are best used to capture this diversity. Sequence recovery, annotation, and sequence resolution among taxa were evaluated for four established DNA markers (matK, rbcL, ITS2, and the trnL P6 loop) in silico using database sequences and in situ using high throughput sequencing of 35 soil samples from a remote boreal wetland. Overall, ITS2 and rbcL are recommended for DNA metabarcoding of vascular plants from eDNA when not using customized or geographically restricted reference databases. We describe a new framework for evaluating DNA metabarcodes and, contrary to existing assumptions, we found that full length DNA barcode regions could outperform shorter markers for surveying plant diversity from soil samples. By using current DNA barcoding markers rbcL and ITS2 for plant metabarcoding, we can take advantage of existing resources such as the growing DNA barcode database. Our work establishes the value of standard DNA barcodes for soil plant eDNA analysis in ecological investigations and biomonitoring programs and supports the collaborative development of DNA barcoding and metabarcoding.																	1932-6203					JUN 16	2016	11	6							e0157505	10.1371/journal.pone.0157505								WOS:000378029800088	27310720					
J	Rayne, S; Forest, K				Rayne, Sierra; Forest, Kaya			Rapidly changing climatic conditions for wine grape growing in the Okanagan Valley region of British Columbia, Canada	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												A statistical analysis was conducted on long-term climate records for sites bordering Okanagan Lake in the Okanagan Valley viticultural region of British Columbia, Canada. Average wine grape growing season temperatures are increasing rapidly in the area over the post-1980 period at rates upwards of 7.0 +/- 1.3 degrees C/century. Similar increases in the average dormant season temperature are evident. These temperature changes are likely some of the most extreme observed among the world's wine producing areas during the past few decades. Growing degree day base 10 degrees C (GDD(10)) has increased by nearly 50% at some locations since the 1970s, resulting in major impacts on the corresponding climate classification for viticulture. If current climate trends continue, the southern and central portions of the region will likely enter Winkler region II within the next few decades, placing them in the same category as well-established warmer wine regions from France, Spain, Italy, and Australia. The large dormant season temperature increases over the last several decades have resulted in the area no longer being a cold season outlier when compared to most other cool-climate viticultural areas. Based on average growing season temperatures, the southern end of Okanagan Lake has moved out of the cool-climate viticultural classification and into the intermediate zone, while the central and northern regions are now at the cool/intermediate viticulture interface, similar to the historical positions of the Rhine Valley in Germany, northern Oregon in the United States, and the Loire Valley, Burgundy-Cote, Burgundy-Beaujolais, and Champagne appelations of France. The corresponding suitable grape species for the area have evolved into warmer region varietals during this time frame, having substantial economic impacts on producers. Increased temperatures are also expected to bring greater threats from agricultural pests, notably Pierce's disease from the bacterium Xylella fastidiosa. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Evidence for light-controlled migration amplitude of a sound scattering layer in the Norwegian Sea	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The oceanic sound scattering layer (SL) is an ubiquitous acoustic signature of mesopelagic fishes and invertebrates that are important food sources for the oceanic macrofauna and players in the biological carbon pump. We investigated the relationship between SL migration amplitude and light in the Norwegian Sea. Incoming surface irradiance was measured continuously during night and day. The increasing latitude of the cruise track facilitated a field experiment wherein night light increased 2 to 3 orders of magnitude during the study period. Concurrent with increased night light, the diel vertical migration amplitude of the SL decreased several hundred meters. The variations in irradiance at the sea surface spanned 6 orders of magnitude during the study period, while the ambient irradiance of the SL mean depth was relatively constant during both day- and nighttime. For the deepest penetrating wavelength (486 nm), the average ambient light was estimated to be 2 x 10(-6) mW m(-2) nm(-1), which corresponded to a total irradiance of 1.9 x 10(-7) mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1). The observed variation in migration amplitude is consistent with a behavior whereby the SL organisms keep their ambient light intensities within a particular range. We also observed that SL total backscattering, a proxy for biomass, decreased along with the decrease in migration amplitude. We speculate whether this decrease might, in part, relate to a previously proposed 'photoperiod constraint hypothesis' suggesting that high night light intensities in summer at high latitudes limit options for safe foraging in upper layers at night.																	0171-8630	1616-1599				JUN 9	2016	551						45	52		10.3354/meps11731								WOS:000379812000004

Materials and methods: In the present study, initially, the effects of temperature and inorganic carbon source on C. vulgaris microalgae were investigated in terms of biomass concentration, lipid content and productivity. Afterwards, one of the statistical experimental designs, response surface methodology was applied to find the optimum amount of light intensity and photoperiod that highly influence on microalgae growth and lipid content. Results and conclusions: Results showed that C. vulgaris could grow in a wide range of temperature (25 degrees C-35 degrees C). The optimal temperature to produce maximum microalgae biomass and lipid was 30 degrees C and the biomass production of 394 mg/l and lipid productivity of 6.07 mg/l. d were obtained after 7 days of batch cultivation. Using a higher concentration of sodium carbonate, tenfold of control experiment, along with 0.03% carbon dioxide from the aeration could substantially enhance the microalgae growth rate (0.66 d(-1)), biomass production (500 mg/l) and lipid productivity (7.34 mg/l. d). According to the results of experimental design, illumination of 3500 lux and photoperiod of 12:12 hour were the optimum amounts that led to a twofold increase in biomass and lipid productivity compared with unoptimized condition.																	0031-5362					JUN	2016	118	2					123	129		10.18054/pb.2016.118.2.3197								WOS:000380806700007

Endophyte presence provides plant parasitic nematode resistance, but not with all endophyte strains and cultivar combinations. This study sought to compare effects of four nematode genera on continental and Mediterranean cultivars infected with common toxic or novel endophyte strains. A 6-mon greenhouse study was conducted with continental cultivars, Kentucky 31 (common toxic) and Texoma MaxQ II (novel endophyte) and the Mediterranean cultivar Flecha MaxQ (novel endophyte). Endophyte-free plants of each cultivar were controls. Each cultivar x endophyte combination was randomly assigned to a control, low or high inoculation rate of a mixed nematode culture containing stunt nematodes (Tylenchorhynchus spp.), ring nematodes (Criconemella spp.), spiral nematodes (Helicotylenchus spp.), and lesion nematodes (Pratylenchus spp.). Endophyte infection had no effect on nematode population densities. The cultivar x endophyte interaction was significant. Population densities of stunt nematode, spiral nematode, and ring nematodes were higher for Flecha MaxQ than other cultivar x endophyte combinations.

J	Vilcinskas, A; Vogel, H				Vilcinskas, Andreas; Vogel, Heiko			Seasonal phenotype-specific transcriptional reprogramming during metamorphosis in the European map butterfly Araschnia levana	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												The European map butterfly (Araschnia levana) is a classic example of seasonal polyphenism because the spring and summer imagoes display two distinct morphological phenotypes. The light regime and temperature during larval and prepupal development determine whether or not the pupae commit to diapause and overwintering and thus whether spring or summer imagoes emerge. We used suppression subtractive hybridization to experimentally screen for genes that are differentially expressed in prepupae committed either to accelerated metamorphosis and egg production or diapause and overwintering. The range and ontology of the differentially expressed genes in prepupae developing from larvae exposed either to long-day (LD) or short-day (SD) conditions revealed fundamental differences. The SD prepupae preferentially expressed genes related to cuticle formation and immunity, reflecting the formation of a robust pupal exoskeleton and the upregulation of antimicrobial peptides as preparations for overwintering. One protein preferentially expressed in SD prepupae has a counterpart in Bombyx mori that functions as a diapause duration clock. The differentially expressed genes in LD prepupae included several members of the dusky and osiris families. We also observed the strong induction of different yellow-like genes under SD and LD conditions which suggest a role in the developmental choice between seasonal phenotypes. Our transcriptomic data will facilitate the more detailed analysis of molecular mechanisms underlying seasonal polyphenism.																	2045-7758					JUN	2016	6	11					3476	3485		10.1002/ece3.2120								WOS:000377043200003	27127610

We have traced the entrainment of activity rhythm of northern Drosophila montana flies in a climate chamber mimicking the photoperiods and day and night temperatures that the flies encounter in northern Finland during the summer. The experiment was started by transferring freshly emerged females into the chamber in early and late summer conditions to obtain both non-diapausing and diapausing females for the studies. The locomotor activity of the females and daily changes in the expression levels of two core circadian clock genes, timeless and period, in their heads were measured at different times of summer. The study revealed several features in fly rhythmicity that are likely to help the flies to cope with high variation in the day length and temperature typical to northern summers. First, both the non-diapausing and the diapausing females showed evening activity, which decreased towards the short day length as observed in the autumn in nature. Second, timeless and period genes showed concordant daily oscillations and seasonal shifts in their expression level in both types of females. Contrary to Drosophila melanogaster, oscillation profiles of these genes were similar to each other in all conditions, including the extremely long days in early summer and the cool temperatures in late summer, and their peak expression levels were not locked to lights-off transition in any photoperiod. Third, the diapausing females were less active than the non-diapausing ones, in spite of their younger age. Overall, the study showed that D. montana clock functions well under long day conditions, and that both the photoperiod and the daily temperature cycles are important zeitgebers for seasonal changes in the circadian rhythm of this species.

Reproductive arrest and stress resistance in winter-acclimated Drosophila suzukii	JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY												Overwintering insects must survive the multiple-stress environment of winter, which includes low temperatures, reduced food and water availability, and cold-active pathogens. Many insects overwinter in diapause, a developmental arrest associated with high stress tolerance. Drosophila suzukii (Diptera: Drosophilidae), spotted wing drosophila, is an invasive agricultural pest worldwide. Its ability to overwinter and therefore establish in temperate regions could have severe implications for fruit crop industries. We demonstrate here that laboratory populations of Canadian D. suzukii larvae reared under short-day, low temperature, conditions develop into dark 'winter morph' adults similar to those reported globally from field captures, and observed by us in southern Ontario, Canada. These winter-acclimated adults have delayed reproductive maturity, enhanced cold tolerance, and can remain active at low temperatures, although they do not have the increased desiccation tolerance or survival of fungal pathogen challenges that might be expected from a more heavily melanised cuticle. Winter-acclimated female D. suzukii have underdeveloped ovaries and altered transcript levels of several genes associated with reproduction and stress. While superficially indicative of reproductive diapause, the delayed reproductive maturity of winter-acclimated D. suzukii appears to be temperature-dependent, not regulated by photoperiod, and is thus unlikely to be 'true' diapause. The traits of this 'winter morph', however, likely facilitate overwintering in southern Canada, and have probably contributed to the global success of this fly as an invasive species.

Pandora bullata (Entomophthoromycota: Entomophthorales) affecting calliphorid flies in central Brazil	ACTA TROPICA												Fungi are where one finds them, and if one seeks fungal pathogens affecting flies, then a garbage dump may be an ideal place to find both persistent, abundant fly populations and their fungal pathogens. An obvious fungal epizootic affecting the oriental latrine fly, Chrysomya megacephala (Diptera: Calliphoridae), was observed over several days in mid-February 2015 at the local garbage dump adjacent to the city of Cavalcante, northern Goias. This site harbored large populations of both C. megacephala and a Musca sp. (Diptera: Muscidae) but only the population of oriental latrine fly was affected by any fungal pathogen and presented unusually dense populations of fresh cadavers. The fungus was identifiable as Pandora bullata (Entomophthorales: Entomophthoraceae) only after a very small number of characteristically decorated resting spores were found in these flies two months later; this represents the first Brazilian (and South American) record of this species. P. bullata is known previously from a small number of North American, European and Australian collections, all of which have included relatively abundant production of resting spores. We cannot dismiss the possibility that the extremely sparse formation of resting spores at this Brazilian site may be due to abiotic factors such as latitude (13 degrees 46'40.53"S), day length, ambient temperatures, or even the precipitation patterns in this mid-tropical montaine site. Epizootic events affecting calliphorids in Brazil strengthen the interest in entomophthoran pathogens for biological control of flies. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Coupling Developmental Physiology, Photoperiod, and Temperature to Model Phenology and Dynamics of an Invasive Heteropteran, Halyomorpha halys	FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY												We developed an agent-based stochastic model expressing stage-specific phenology and population dynamics for an insect species across geographic regions. We used the invasive pentatomid, Halyomorpha halys, as the model organism because gaps in knowledge exist regarding its developmental physiology, it is expanding its global distribution, and it is of significant economic importance. Model predictions were compared against field observations over 3 years, and the parameter set that enables the largest population growth was applied to eight locations over 10 years, capturing the variation in temperature and photoperiod profiles of significant horticultural crop production that could be affected by H. halys in the US. As a species that overwinters as adults, critical photoperiod significantly impacted H. halys seasonality and population size through its influence on diapause termination and induction, and this may impact other insects with similar life-histories. Photoperiod and temperature interactions influenced life stage synchrony among years, resulting in an order of magnitude difference, for occurrence of key life stages. At all locations, there was a high degree of overlap among life stages and generation. Although all populations produced F-2 adults and thus could be characterized as bivoltine, the size and relative contribution of each generation to the total, or overwintering, adult population also varied dramatically. In about half of the years in two locations (Geneva, NY and Salem, OR), F-1 adults comprised half or more of the adult population at the end of the year. Yearly degree-day accumulation was a significant covariate influencing variation in population growth, and average maximum adult population size varied by 10-fold among locations. Average final population growth was positive (Asheville, NC, Homestead, FL, Davis, CA) or marginal (Geneva, NY, Bridgeton, NJ, Salem, OR, Riverside, CA), but was negative in one location (Wenatchee WA) due to cooler temperatures coupled with timing of vitellogenesis of F-2 adults. Years of the highest population growth in the mid-Atlantic site coincided with years of highest crop damage reports. We discuss these results with respect to assumptions and critical knowledge gaps, the ability to realistically model phenology of species with strongly overlapping life stage and which diapause as adults.																	1664-042X					MAY 18	2016	7								165	10.3389/fphys.2016.00165								WOS:000376058400001	27242539

The LM mutant, lm3 was derived from a single naturally mutated individual in the F1 population of a 3-1/Jing411 cross, backcrossed six times with 3-1 as the recurrent parent and subsequently self-pollinated twice. The leaves of young seedlings of the lm3 mutant exhibited small, discrete white lesions under natural field conditions. The lesions first appeared at the leaf tips and subsequently expanded throughout the entire leaf blade to the leaf sheath. The lesions were initiated through light intensity and day length. Histochemical staining revealed that lesion formation might reflect programmed cell death (PCD) and abnormal accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The chlorophyll content in the mutant was significantly lower than that in wildtype, and the ratio of chlorophyll a/b was increased significantly in the mutant compared with wildtype, indicating that lm3 showed impairment of the biosynthesis or degradation of chlorophyll, and that Chlorophyll b was prone to damage during lesion formation. The lm3 mutant exhibited enhanced resistance to wheat powdery mildew fungus (Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici; Bgt) infection, which was consistent with the increased expression of seven pathogenesis-related (PR) and two wheat chemically induced (WCI) genes involved in the defense-related reaction. Genetic analysis showed that the mutation was controlled through a single partially dominant gene, which was closely linked to Xbarc203 on chromosome 3BL; this gene was delimited to a 40 Mb region between SSR3B450.37 and SSR3B492.6 using a large derived segregating population and the available Chinese Spring chromosome 3B genome sequence. Taken together, our results provide information regarding the identification of a novel wheat LM gene, which will facilitate the additional fine-mapping and cloning of the gene to understand the mechanism underlying LM initiation and disease resistance in common wheat.																	1932-6203					MAY 13	2016	11	5							e0155358	10.1371/journal.pone.0155358								WOS:000376589400010	27175509

Persistence of a Wolbachia infection frequency cline in Drosophila melanogaster and the possible role of reproductive dormancy	EVOLUTION												Field populations of arthropods are often polymorphic for Wolbachia but the factors maintaining intermediate Wolbachia frequencies are generally not understood. In Drosophila melanogaster, Wolbachia frequencies are highly variable across the globe. We document the persistence of a Wolbachia infection frequency cline in D. melanogaster populations from eastern Australia across at least 20 years, with frequencies generally high in the tropics but lower in cool temperate regions. The results are interpreted using a model of frequency dynamics incorporating cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), imperfect maternal transmission and Wolbachia effects on fitness. Clinal variation is less pronounced in eastern North America which may reflect annual recolonization at higher latitudes. Limited samples from Africa from latitudes matching our tropical and subtropical samples from Australia and North America show comparably high infection frequencies, but some equatorial samples show lower frequencies. Adult dormancy across cold periods may contribute to the Australian Wolbachia cline. Infected flies exposed to cold conditions for an extended period had reduced fecundity and viability, an effect not evident in unexposed controls. These fitness costs may contribute to the relatively low Wolbachia frequencies in Australian temperate areas; whereas different processes, including CI induced by young males, may contribute to higher frequencies in tropical locations.

Estimates of the force of blood-stage infections arising from primary infections and relapses are important for designing intervention strategies. However, in endemic settings their relative contributions are unclear. Infections are frequently asymptomatic, many individuals harbor multiple infections, and while high-resolution genotyping of blood samples enables individual infections to be distinguished, primary infections and relapses cannot be identified. We develop a model and fit it to longitudinal genotyping data from children in Papua New Guinea to estimate the incidence and seasonality of P vivax primary infection and relapse. The children, aged one to three years at enrolment, were followed up over 16 months with routine surveys every two months. Blood samples were taken at the routine visits and at other times if the child was ill. Samples positive by microscopy or a molecular method for species detection were genotyped using high-resolution capillary electrophoresis for P vivax MS16 and msp1F3, and P falciparum msp2. The data were summarized as longitudinal patterns of success or failure to detect a genotype at each routine time-point (eg 001000001). We assume that the seasonality of P vivax primary infection is similar to that of P falciparum since they are transmitted by the same vectors and, because P falciparum does not have the ability to relapse, the seasonality can be estimated. Relapses occurring during the study period can be a consequence of infections occurring prior to the study: we assume that the seasonal pattern of primary infections repeats over time. We incorporate information from parasitological and entomology studies to gain leverage for estimating the parameters, and take imperfect detection into account. We estimate the force of P vivax primary infections to be 11.5 (10.5, 12.3) for a three-year old child per year and the mean number of relapses per infection to be 4.3 (4.0, 4.6) over 16 months. The peak incidence of relapses occurred in the two month interval following the peak interval for primary infections: the contribution to the force of blood-stage infection from relapses is between 71% and 90% depending on the season. Our estimates contribute to knowledge of the P vivax epidemiology and have implications for the timing of intervention strategies targeting different stages of the life cycle.

In the yellow monkey flower, Mimulus guttatus, geographically distinct North American populations vary in their photoperiod and chilling (vernalization) requirements for flowering, suggesting strong local adaptation to their surroundings. Previous analyses revealed quantitative trait loci (QTL) underlying short-day mediated vernalization responsiveness using two annual M. guttatus populations that differed in their vernalization response. To narrow down candidate genes responsible for this variation, and to reveal potential downstream genes, we conducted comparative transcriptomics and quantitative PCR (qPCR) in shoot apices of parental vernalization responsive IM62, and unresponsive LMC24 inbred lines grown under different photoperiods and temperatures. Our study identified several metabolic, hormone signaling, photosynthetic, stress response, and flowering time genes that are differentially expressed between treatments, suggesting a role for their protein products in short-daymediated vernalization responsiveness. Only a small subset of these genes intersected with candidate genes from the previous QTL study, and, of the main candidates tested with qPCR under nonpermissive conditions, only SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) gene expression met predictions for a populationspecific short-day-repressor of flowering that is repressed by cold.

Many species use day length as a cue to increase their cold tolerance and/or enter into diapause, but little is known about changes in gene expression that occur under different day lengths. We investigate the gene expression changes associated with differences in light/dark cycles in Drosophila montana, a northerly distributed species with a strong adult photoperiodic reproductive diapause. To examine gene expression changes induced by light both prior to and during diapause, we used both nondiapausing and diapausing flies. We found that the majority of genes that are differentially expressed between different day lengths in nondiapausing and diapausing flies differ. However, the biological processes involved were broadly similar. These included neuron development and metabolism, which are largely consistent with an increase in cold tolerance previously observed to occur in these flies. We also found that many genes associated with reproduction change in expression level between different day lengths, suggesting that D. montana use changes in day length to cue changes in reproduction both before and after entering into diapause. Finally, we also identified several interesting candidate genes for lightinduced changes including Lsp2, para, and Ih.

Allelic Variation in Developmental Genes and Effects on Winter Wheat Heading Date in the US Great Plains	PLOS ONE												Heading date in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and other small grain cereals is affected by the vernalization and photoperiod pathways. The reduced-height loci also have an effect on growth and development. Heading date, which occurs just prior to anthesis, was evaluated in a population of 299 hard winter wheat entries representative of the U.S. Great Plains region, grown in nine environments during 2011-2012 and 2012-2013. The germplasm was evaluated for candidate genes at vernalization (Vrn-A1, Vrn-B1, and Vrn-D1), photoperiod (Ppd-A1, Ppd-B1 and Ppd-D1), and reduced-height (Rht-B1 and Rht-D1) loci using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP) assays. Our objectives were to determine allelic variants known to affect flowering time, assess the effect of allelic variants on heading date, and investigate changes in the geographic and temporal distribution of alleles and haplotypes. Our analyses enhanced understanding of the roles developmental genes have on the timing of heading date in wheat under varying environmental conditions, which could be used by breeding programs to improve breeding strategies under current and future climate scenarios. The significant main effects and two-way interactions between the candidate genes explained an average of 44% of variability in heading date at each environment. Among the loci we evaluated, most of the variation in heading date was explained by Ppd-D1, Ppd-B1, and their interaction. The prevalence of the photoperiod sensitive alleles Ppd-A1b, Ppd-B1b, and Ppd-D1b has gradually decreased in U.S. Great Plains germplasm over the past century. There is also geographic variation for photoperiod sensitive and reduced-height alleles, with germplasm from breeding programs in the northern Great Plains having greater incidences of the photoperiod sensitive alleles and lower incidence of the semi-dwarf alleles than germplasm from breeding programs in the central or southern plains.

Thermal Tolerances of the Spotted-Wing Drosophila Drosophila suzukii (Diptera: Drosophilidae)	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY												The spotted-wing drosophila (Drosophila suzukii Matsumura) is an invasive species of Asian origin that is now widely distributed in North America and Europe. Because of the female's serrated ovipositor, eggs are laid in preharvest fruit, causing large economic losses in cultivated berries and stone fruit. Modeling D. suzukii population dynamics and potential distribution will require information on its thermal tolerance. Large summer populations have been found in regions with severe winter conditions, though little is known about responses to prolonged low-temperature exposure. We used controlled chambers to examine D. suzukii fecundity, development rate, and mortality across a range of temperatures encompassing the upper and lower thresholds (5-35A degrees C). Optimal temperatures (T-opt) were found to be 28.2A degrees C for the development of the egg-to-adult stage, and 22.9A degrees C for reproductive output. No adult eclosion occurred below 8.1A degrees C (T-lower) or above 30.9A degrees C (T-upper). We also investigated survival outcomes following prolonged (42-d) low-temperature exposure to a simulated cold winter (-5, -3, -1, 1, 3, and 5A degrees C). Adult survival was dependent on temperature, with a mean LT50 of 4.9A degrees C. There were no effects of sex, mating status, geographic strain, and photoperiod preexposure on overwintering survival. Thirty-eight percent of females that were mated prior, but not after, prolonged low-temperature exposure produced viable offspring, suggesting that this species may undergo sperm storage. This study provides data on the thermal tolerances of D. suzukii, which can be used for models of D. suzukii population dynamics, degree-day, and distribution models.																	0022-0493	1938-291X				APR	2016	109	2					746	752		10.1093/jee/tow006								WOS:000374497000033	26880397

BLANCHARD'S CRICKET FROG ACRIS BLANCHARDI OVERWINTERING ECOLOGY IN SOUTHWESTERN WISCONSIN	HERPETOLOGICAL CONSERVATION AND BIOLOGY												Blanchard's Cricket Frogs (Acris blanchardi) were once considered among the most abundant frog species in southern Wisconsin, USA. Although historically documented in 31 counties, it is currently found in only a handful of these due to substantial population declines in the late 20th Century. Explanations for this dramatic reduction in numbers include environmental pollutants, climate change, and habitat loss. Unfortunately, a poor understanding of the basic ecology and natural history of this species hinders effective conservation. To achieve a more thorough understanding of overwintering ecology at the northern edge of their range, we surveyed 10 sites in southwestern Wisconsin in an effort to describe the hibernacula and pre-hibernation behavior of Blanchard's Cricket Frogs. We conducted transect and haphazard surveys to determine when most cricket frogs entered hibernacula and the type of hibernacula available (e.g., crayfish burrow, crack in stream banks). Of 385 possible hibernacula assessed, only 20 at four sites were occupied by Blanchard's Cricket Frogs. Most hibernation occurred in exposed cracks formed by the sloughing of river banks, but we observed partially individual frogs twice within small (1 cm diameter) burrows. Hibernating cricket frogs were never observed in large crayfish burrows, under grass, leaves, or logs, or burrowed in gravel banks, as observed elsewhere in their range. Communal hibernation was observed in 13 of the occupied hibernacula. Mean minimum hibernation depth for cricket frogs was 4.7 cm. Our results suggest that exposed, south-facing river banks are critical habitat, and effective Blanchard's Cricket Frog conservation in southern Wisconsin should protect such habitat near known populations.																	2151-0733	1931-7603				APR	2016	11	1					101	111										WOS:000375251800011

Long-Term Lesser Prairie-Chicken Nest Ecology in Response to Grassland Management	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Long-term population and range declines from habitat loss and fragmentation caused the lesser prairie-chicken (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus) to be a species of concern throughout its range. Current lesser prairie-chicken range in New Mexico and Texas is partially restricted to sand shinnery oak (Quercus havardii; hereafter shinnery oak) prairies, on which cattle grazing is the main socioeconomic driver for private landowners. Cattle producers within shinnery oak prairies often focus land management on shrub eradication using the herbicide tebuthiuron to promote grass production for forage; however, herbicide application alone, and in combination with grazing, may affect nest site selection and nest survival of lesser prairie-chickens through the reduction of shinnery oak and native grasses. We used a controlled, paired, completely randomized design study to assess the influence of grazing and tebuthiuron application and their combined use on nest site selection and nest survival from 2001 to 2010 in Roosevelt County, New Mexico, USA at 2 spatial scales (i.e., treatment and microhabitat) in 4 treatments: tebuthiuron with grazing, tebuthiuron without grazing, no tebuthiuron with grazing, and a control of no tebuthiuron and no grazing. Grazing treatment was a short-duration system in which plots were grazed once during the dormant season and once during the growing season. Stocking rate was calculated each season based on measured forage production and applied to remove <= 25% of available herbaceous material per season. At the treatment scale, we compared nest site selection among treatments using 1-way chi(2) tests and nest survival among treatments using a priori candidate nest survival models in Program MARK. At the microhabitat scale, we identified important habitat predictors of nest site selection and nest survival using logistic regression and a priori candidate nest survival models in Program MARK, respectively. Females typically used treatments as expected and we did not detect trends in selection. Nest survival did not differ among treatments. At the microhabitat scale, nest sites had less bare ground (P = 0.001) and greater angles of obstruction (P = 0.001) compared to random sites. There was a high degree of model selection uncertainty among our candidate models at the microhabitat scale and survival estimates were similar among habitat covariates. Results suggest a tebuthiuron application rate of 0.60 kg/ha, short-duration grazing, and a combination of these management techniques were not detrimental to lesser prairie-chicken nest site selection or nest survival. However, intensified management that increases bare ground or reduces overhead cover may negatively affect lesser prairie-chicken nesting habitat and nest survival.

Camera recording and video analysis have emerged as a successful non-invasive method for collecting a wide range of biological data on many different taxa of animals. However, camera monitoring has rarely been applied to long-term surveillance of cavity or box-nesting species and ordinary off-the-shelf cameras are employed. 2. We present methodology and data on the effectiveness of nest box monitoring using a camera system embedded in four smart nest boxes' (SNBoxes). We applied the SNBoxes to eight Tengmalm's owl (Aegolius funereus) nests in the Czech Republic during a 5-month period in 2014. Each SNBox consisted of a pair of cameras with infrared lighting, an event detector, a radiofrequency identification reader, auxiliary sensors and a 60 Ah 12V battery to power the whole system. All devices used were centrally managed by an embedded computer with specifically developed software. 3. Using four SNBoxes, we observed owl nesting continually during the incubation, nestling and fledgling phases, in total 309days, resulting in 3382 owl video events. Batteries were changed every 65days. A memory of 4GB was found sufficient to store monthly data. We identified 12 types of male and female parental activities and their timing, the diet composition and frequency of prey delivery, the manner of prey storage, the light intensity at the time of each parental activity, the temperature inside the clutch and outside the box and the duration of nestling period of each young. We also produced a video on owl nesting for the general public. 4. The SNBox and related methodology show enormous potential as a non-invasive tool for monitoring animals using boxes or natural cavities. The main advantage of the SNBox is the possibility to study both nocturnal and diurnal animal species and great flexibility in use of the software and hardware for different tasks. As a result, the SNBox provides an opportunity for novel insights into the breeding, roosting, hibernating, and food storage activities of a wide range of cavity-living birds, mammals and reptiles.

Reproductive Allochrony in Seasonally Sympatric Populations Maintained by Differential Response to Photoperiod: Implications for Population Divergence and Response to Climate Change	AMERICAN NATURALIST												Reproductive allochrony presents a potential barrier to gene flow and is common in seasonally sympatric migratory and sedentary birds. Mechanisms mediating reproductive allochrony can influence population divergence and the capacity of populations to respond to environmental change. We asked whether reproductive allochrony in seasonally sympatric birds results from a difference in response to supplementary or photoperiodic cues and whether the response varies in relation to the distance separating breeding and wintering locations as measured by stable isotopes. We held seasonally sympatric migratory and sedentary male dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis) in a common garden in early spring under simulated natural changes in photoperiod and made measurements of reproductive and migratory physiology. On the same dates and photoperiods, sedentary juncos had higher testosterone (initial and gonadotropin-releasing hormone induced), more developed cloacal protuberances, and larger testes than migrants. In contrast, migratory juncos had larger fat reserves (fuel for migration). We found a negative relationship between testis mass and feather hydrogen isotope ratios, indicating that testis growth was more delayed in migrants making longer migrations. We conclude that reproductive allochrony in seasonally sympatric migratory and sedentary birds can result from a differential response to photoperiodic cues in a common garden, and as a result, gene flow between migrants and residents may be reduced by photoperiodic control of reproductive development. Further, earlier breeding in response to future climate change may currently be constrained by differential response to photoperiodic cues.																	0003-0147	1537-5323				APR	2016	187	4					436	446		10.1086/685296								WOS:000373127000007	27028072

Our aim was to better understand how ecological variables might influence body size and thereby explain this mixed support. LocationWorld-wide. MethodsPrevious explanations do not allow for the selective pressure exerted by the trade-off between predation and starvation, which we incorporate in a model of optimal body size and energy storage of a generalized homeotherm. In contrast to existing arguments, we concentrate on survival over winter when the food supply is poor and can be interrupted for short periods. ResultsWe use our model to assess the logical validity of the heat conservation hypothesis and show that it must allow for the roles of both food availability and predation risk. We find that whether the effect of temperature on body size is positive or negative depends on temperature range, predator density, and the likelihood of long interruptions to foraging. Furthermore, changing day length explains differing effects of altitude and latitude on body size, leading to opposite predictions for nocturnal and diurnal endotherms. Food availability and ambient temperature can have counteracting selective pressures on body mass, and can lead to a non-monotonic relationship between latitude and size, as observed in several studies. Main conclusionsOur work provides a theoretical framework for understanding the relationships between the costs and benefits of large body size and eco-geographical patterns among endotherms world-wide.

ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												1. Diapause is a dynamic process of low metabolic activity that allows insects to survive periods of harsh conditions. Notwithstanding the lowered metabolism, and because diapausing insects have no access to food, diapause has an energetic cost that may affect post-diapause performance. 2. Previous studies on the solitary bee Osmia lignaria have shown that prolonged pre-wintering periods (the time during which individuals already in diapause remain at warm temperatures) are associated with elevated lipid consumption, fat body depletion, and body weight loss. The present study investigated whether prolonged pre-wintering also affects reproduction, i.e. whether the costs associated with diapause could have an effect on post-diapause performance in this species. 3. Females were exposed to a range of pre-wintering conditions, and ovary development and individual post-wintering performance were monitored throughout their adult life span. 4. No evidence of an effect of pre-wintering duration on post-diapause reproductive success was found. Expected differences in the timing of establishment were not observed because ovary maturation was, surprisingly, not arrested during pre-wintering. Prolonged pre-wintering duration did not result in decreased life span, probably because emerging females could rapidly replenish their metabolic reserves through feeding. However, there was a very strong effect of the duration of the pre-emergence period on the likelihood of nest establishment. 5. Longevity, the main factor determining fecundity in Osmia, is subjected to high levels of intrinsic variability, even among females of similar size exposed to identical conditions during development and nesting.

The dynamical equations combine a model for tumor development under angiogenic signaling formulated by Hahnfeldt et al. with a model for tumor-immune system interactions by Stepanova. The dynamical properties of the model are analyzed. Depending on the parameter values, the system encompasses a variety of medically realistic scenarios that range from cases when (i) low-dose metronomic chemotherapy is able to eradicate the tumor (all trajectories converge to a tumor-free equilibrium point) to situations when (ii) tumor dormancy is induced (a unique, globally asymptotically stable benign equilibrium point exists) to (iii) multi-stable situations that have both persistent benign and malignant behaviors separated by the stable manifold of an unstable equilibrium point and finally to (iv) situations when tumor growth cannot be overcome by low-dose metronomic chemotherapy. The model forms a basis for a more general study of chemotherapy when the main components of a tumor's microenvironment are taken into account.																	0303-6812	1432-1416				APR	2016	72	5					1255	1280		10.1007/s00285-015-0907-y								WOS:000371294400005	26089097

Seasonal cues induce phenotypic plasticity of Drosophila suzukii to enhance winter survival	BMC ECOLOGY												Background: As global climate change and exponential human population growth intensifies pressure on agricultural systems, the need to effectively manage invasive insect pests is becoming increasingly important to global food security. Drosophila suzukii is an invasive pest that drastically expanded its global range in a very short time since 2008, spreading to most areas in North America and many countries in Europe and South America. Preliminary ecological modeling predicted a more restricted distribution and, for this reason, the invasion of D. suzukii to northern temperate regions is especially unexpected. Investigating D. suzukii phenology and seasonal adaptations can lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms through which insects express phenotypic plasticity, which likely enables invasive species to successfully colonize a wide range of environments. Results: We describe seasonal phenotypic plasticity in field populations of D. suzukii. Specifically, we observed a trend of higher proportions of flies with the winter morph phenotype, characterized by darker pigmentation and longer wing length, as summer progresses to winter. A laboratory-simulated winter photoperiod and temperature (12: 12 L:D and 10 degrees C) were sufficient to induce the winter morph phenotype in D. suzukii. This winter morph is associated with increased survival at 1 degrees C when compared to the summer morph, thus explaining the ability of D. suzukii to survive cold winters. We then used RNA sequencing to identify gene expression differences underlying seasonal differences in D. suzukii physiology. Winter morph gene expression is consistent with known mechanisms of cold-hardening such as adjustments to ion transport and up-regulation of carbohydrate metabolism. In addition, transcripts involved in oogenesis and DNA replication were down-regulated in the winter morph, providing the first molecular evidence of a reproductive diapause in D. suzukii. Conclusions: To date, D. suzukii cold resistance studies suggest that this species cannot overwinter in northern locations, e.g. Canada, even though they are established pests in these regions. Combining physiological investigations with RNA sequencing, we present potential mechanisms by which D. suzukii can overwinter in these regions. This work may contribute to more accurate population models that incorporate seasonal variation in physiological parameters, leading to development of better management strategies.																	1472-6785					MAR 22	2016	16								11	10.1186/s12898-016-0070-3								WOS:000372494700001	27001084

Many mesopelagic organisms perform light-dependent diel vertical migration. It has been hypothesised that extreme light regimes encountered at high latitudes may disturb these migration patterns and thereby limit the northern expansion of mesopelagic fauna into the Arctic. Using hydroacoustic data collected during 4 surveys conducted in the open Norwegian Sea during the summer season, we evaluated if the key features of mesopelagic fauna reported worldwide (high density and diel vertical migration) are also observed in the high latitudes of the Northeast Atlantic. The results confirm that the high-latitude Northeast Atlantic hosts a high density of mesopelagic fauna which performs daily migration patterns similar to those reported in other regions. They also support the limiting effect of photoperiod on its potential biomass. These results stress the need for thorough studies on the abundance, biodiversity and trophic ecology of the mesopelagic fauna in this region.

At higher latitudes, seasonal singing is stimulated by increasing day-length and elevated circulating testosterone. However, a large number of songbird species inhabit equatorial regions under a nearly constant photoperiod, and the neuroendocrine mechanisms of seasonal song in these species have rarely been investigated. We studied males from an equatorial population of the silver-beaked tanager (Ramphocelus carbo), an Amazonian songbird. We found seasonality in dawn-song behavior, which was displayed continuously for more than half a year throughout an extended breeding territoriality stage. The seasonal activation of dawn song was correlated with an increased area of androgen receptor expression in HVC, a major brain area of song control. However, testosterone levels remained low for several weeks after activation of dawn-song. Circulating levels of testosterone were elevated only later in the breeding season, coinciding with a higher dawn-song output and with the mating period. Our results suggest that the seasonal activation of dawn-song and territoriality involves an increase of androgen target cells in HVC. This mechanism could potentially function to circumvent adverse effects of high testosterone levels in a species with an extended breeding season. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

J	McCann, MJ				McCann, Michael J.			Response diversity of free-floating plants to nutrient stoichiometry and temperature: growth and resting body formation	PEERJ												Free-floating plants, like most groups of aquatic primary producers, can become nuisance vegetation under certain conditions. On the other hand, there is substantial optimism for the applied uses of free-floating plants, such as wastewater treatment, biofuel production, and aquaculture. Therefore, understanding the species-specific responses of floating plants to abiotic conditions will inform both management decisions and the beneficial applications of these plants. I measured the responses of three floating plant species common in the northeast United States (Lemna minor, Spirodela polyrhiza, and Wolffia brasiliensis) to nutrient stoichiometry (nitrogen and phosphorus) and temperature in the laboratory. I also used survey data to determine the pattern of species richness of floating plants in the field and its relationship with the dominance of this group. Floating plant species exhibited unique responses to nutrient stoichiometry and temperature in the laboratory, especially under low temperatures (18 degrees C) and low nutrient conditions (0.5 mg N L-1, 0.083 mg P L-1). The three species displayed an apparent tradeoff with different strategies of growth or dormancy. In the field, water bodies with three or more species of floating plants were not more frequently dominated by this group. The response diversity observed in the lab may not be associated with the dominance of this group in the field because it is masked by environmental variability, has a weak effect, or is only important during transient circumstances. Future research to develop applied uses of floating plants should examine response diversity across a greater range of species or clones and environmental conditions.																	2167-8359					MAR 7	2016	4								e1781	10.7717/peerj.1781								WOS:000371663100005	26989619

LUTEA IN THE INTERMOUNTAIN WEST	WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST												Large-scale restoration is occurring in many areas of the western United States and the use of genetically appropriate native plant seed is expected to increase the success of restoration efforts. Thus, determining intraspecific variation among populations and its driving forces are the first steps in successful seed sourcing. Here, we examine intraspecific variation of characters expressed in early life history stages of Cleome lutea var. lutea, an annual forb native to the western United States that has attracted increasing attention as a restoration species because it provisions diverse pollinators. We conducted a common garden experiment comprised of 9 populations sourced from across the Intermountain West in a climate-controlled growth chamber. We measured 10 life history and morphological traits and found significant among-population differences for 9 of them, including seed germination requirements and flowering status. With the exception of seed germination, this variation was not effectively captured by broad ecoregion delineations, nor was it significantly explained by source site climatic differences or geographic distance between sites. However, flowering status was significantly explained by latitude of the source population (P = 0.033), suggesting that among-population variation reflects divergent adaptation to photoperiod. The variation in life history traits that differentiates our study populations indicates that informed seed sourcing will be necessary when using C. lutea var. lutea for restoration. More comprehensive spatial sampling that stratifies both environmental and geographic variates is needed to determine the drivers of population differentiation and the scale of local adaptation in this species. Such sampling can be used to better inform appropriate seed sourcing decisions. Until then, a cautious approach to sourcing this species for use in restoration is indicated.																	1527-0904	1944-8341				MAR	2016	76	1					6	17		10.3398/064.076.0103								WOS:000380879000002

Watershed memory at the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory: The effect of past precipitation and storage on hydrologic response	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												The rainfall-runoff response of watersheds is affected by the legacy of past hydroclimatic conditions. We examined how variability in precipitation affected streamflow using 21 years of daily streamflow and precipitation data from five watersheds at the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory in southwestern North Carolina, USA. The gauged watersheds contained both coniferous and deciduous vegetation, dominant north and south aspects, and differing precipitation magnitudes. Lag-correlations between precipitation and runoff ratios across a range of temporal resolutions indicated strong influence of past precipitation (i.e., watershed memory). At all time-scales, runoff ratios strongly depended on the precipitation of previous time steps. At monthly time scales, the influence of past precipitation was detectable for up to 7 months. At seasonal time scales, the previous season had a greater effect on a season's runoff ratio than the same season's precipitation. At annual time scales, the previous year was equally important for a year's runoff ratio than the same year's precipitation. Estimated watershed storage through time and specifically the previous year's storage state was strongly correlated with the residuals of a regression between annual precipitation and annual runoff, partially explaining observed variability in annual runoff in watersheds with deep soils. This effect was less pronounced in the steepest watershed that also contained shallow soils. We suggest that the location of a watershed on a nonlinear watershed-scale storage-release curve can explain differences in runoff during growing and dormant season between watersheds with different annual evapotranspiration.

PREFORMATIVE MOLT ADJUSTMENT IN PITENOLOGICALLY DIVERGENT POPULATIONS OF THE LESSER GOLDFINCH (SPINUS PSALTRIA)	WILSON JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												The extent to which birds invest in a variable molt reflects the interplay between life history phenology and environmental conditions. This study assesses geographic variation in the preformative molt of the Lesser Goldfinch (Spirzus psaltria) by comparing molt patterns between the Pacific and interior populations of North America which differ in life history phenology by 2 months. Both populations exhibited a strong bimodal pattern in primary replacement where individuals either replaced none or >= 3 primaries. Among individuals that replaced >0 remiges, males molted significantly more remiges than females. The earlier breeding Pacific population contained a significantly greater proportion of individuals that replaced >0 remiges and a significantly greater proportion of individuals that replaced >0 primaries. These results provide observational evidence in support of the early breed extensive molt hypothesis, which states that the preformative molt is adjusted in response to different photoperiod exposure because of later hatch date. Further experimental research is required to validate this hypothesis.																	1559-4491	1938-5447				MAR	2016	128	1					70	74		10.1676/wils-128-01-70-74.1								WOS:000375242000006

Seed Dormancy Mechanisms in Basalt Milkvetch and Western Prairie Clover	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT												A greater diversity of native legumes and forbs is desirable for rangeland restoration practice in the Intermountain Region of the western United States. But for such diversity to materialize in the seed marketplace and to be effective in restoration practice, seeds that germinate reliably in seed fields and on restoration sites are needed. We measured germination response of two native legumes, basalt milkvetch (Astragalus filipes Torr. ex A. Gray) and western prairie clover (Dalea ornata [Douglas] Eaton & Wright), after eight germination treatments. Treatments were a factorial combination of 1) seed scarification with sandpaper (or unscarified), 2) a substrate of moist sand (or blotter paper), and 3) a 3-wk prechill at 5 degrees (or nonprechilled). Cumulative germination increased linearly throughout the 10-wk course of the experiment for all treatment combinations in both species. Scarification increased germination of western prairie clover, but prechilling and substrate had no effect. In contrast, prechilling, scarification, and a sand substrate all increased germination of basalt milkvetch. Hence, for this species the prechilled/scarified/sand treatment combination displayed the numerically highest germination for all 10 wk (30-43%), and the nonprechilled/unscarified/blotter paper treatment combination always germinated lowest (1-3%). Results were consistent with physical dormancy (hard-seededness) limiting germination of western prairie clover and combinational dormancy (i.e., co-occurrence of physical and physiological dormancy) limiting germination of basalt milkvetch. Of the two species, we have found basalt milkvetch to be the more difficult to establish from seed. By prechilling acid-scarified seed in moist sand, basalt milkvetch was successfully established in two field trials seeded in mid-April. Nonprechilled mechanically (sandpaper) scarified seed germinated as high as prechilled acid-scarified seed. By scarifying and prechilling basalt milkvetch seed to address physical and physiological dormancy mechanisms, respectively, this seed-treatment protocol may be "scaled up" to produce large quantities of germinable seed.

Genomic Patterns of Geographic Differentiation in Drosophila simulans	GENETICS												Geographic patterns of genetic differentiation have long been used to understand population history and to learn about the biological mechanisms of adaptation. Here we present an examination of genomic patterns of differentiation between northern and southern populations of Australian and North American Drosophila simulans, with an emphasis on characterizing signals of parallel differentiation. We report on the genomic scale of differentiation and functional enrichment of outlier SNPs. While, overall, signals of shared differentiation are modest, we find the strongest support for parallel differentiation in genomic regions that are associated with regulation. Comparisons to Drosophila melanogaster yield potential candidate genes involved in local adaptation in both species, providing insight into common selective pressures and responses. In contrast to D. melanogaster, in D. simulans we observe patterns of variation that are inconsistent with a model of temperate adaptation out of a tropical ancestral range, highlighting potential differences in demographic and colonization histories of this cosmopolitan species pair.																	0016-6731	1943-2631				MAR	2016	202	3					1229	+		10.1534/genetics.115.185496								WOS:000371596400028	26801179

Global Transcriptional Profiling of Diapause and Climatic Adaptation in Drosophila melanogaster	MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Wild populations of the model organism Drosophila melanogaster experience highly heterogeneous environments over broad geographical ranges as well as over seasonal and annual timescales. Diapause is a primary adaptation to environmental heterogeneity, and in D. melanogaster the propensity to enter diapause varies predictably with latitude and season. Here we performed global transcriptomic profiling of naturally occurring variation in diapause expression elicited by short day photoperiod and moderately low temperature in two tissue types associated with neuroendocrine and endocrine signaling, heads, and ovaries. We show that diapause in D. melanogaster is an actively regulated phenotype at the transcriptional level, suggesting that diapause is not a simple physiological or reproductive quiescence. Differentially expressed genes and pathways are highly distinct in heads and ovaries, demonstrating that the diapause response is not uniform throughout the soma and suggesting that it may be comprised of functional modules associated with specific tissues. Genes downregulated in heads of diapausing flies are significantly enriched for clinally varying single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs) and seasonally oscillating SNPs, consistent with the hypothesis that diapause is a driving phenotype of climatic adaptation. We also show that chromosome location-based coregulation of gene expression is present in the transcriptional regulation of diapause. Taken together, these results demonstrate that diapause is a complex phenotype actively regulated in multiple tissues, and support the hypothesis that natural variation in diapause propensity underlies adaptation to spatially and temporally varying selective pressures.

J	Jones, NT; Gilbert, B				Jones, Natalie T.; Gilbert, Benjamin			Changing climate cues differentially alter zooplankton dormancy dynamics across latitudes	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												In seasonal climates, dormancy is a common strategy that structures biodiversity and is necessary for the persistence of many species. Climate change will likely alter dormancy dynamics in zooplankton, the basis of aquatic food webs, by altering two important hatching cues: mean temperatures during the ice-free season, and mean day length when lakes become ice free. Theory suggests that these changes could alter diversity, hatchling abundances and phenology within lakes, and that these responses may diverge across latitudes due to differences in optimal hatching cues and strategies. To examine the role of temperature and day length on hatching dynamics, we collected sediment from 25 lakes across a 1800km latitudinal gradient and exposed sediment samples to a factorial combination of two photoperiods (12 and 16h) and two temperatures (8 and 12 degrees C) representative of historical southern (short photoperiod, warm) and northern (long photoperiod, cool) lake conditions. We tested whether sensitivity to these hatching cues varies by latitudinal origin and differs among taxa. Higher temperatures advanced phenology for all taxa, and these advances were greatest for cladocerans followed by copepods and rotifers. Although phenology differed among taxa, the effect of temperature did not vary with latitude. The latitudinal origin of the egg bank influenced egg abundance and hatchling abundance and diversity, with these latter effects varying with taxa, temperature and photoperiod. Copepod hatchling abundances peaked at mid-latitudes in the high temperature and long photoperiod treatments, whereas hatchling abundances of other zooplankton were greatest at low latitudes and high temperature. The overall diversity of crustacean zooplankton (copepods and cladocerans) also reflected distinct responses of each taxa to our treatments, with the greatest diversity occurring at mid-latitudes (similar to 56 degrees N) in the shorter photoperiod treatment. Our results demonstrate that hatching cues differ for broad taxonomic groups that vary in developmental and life-history strategies. These differences are predicted to drive latitude-specific shifts in zooplankton emergence with climate change and could alter the base of aquatic food webs.

J	Xi, XQ; Wu, XW; Nylin, S; Sun, SC				Xi, Xinqiang; Wu, Xinwei; Nylin, Soren; Sun, Shucun			Body size response to warming: time of the season matters in a tephritid fly	OIKOS												Whether shrinking body size is a universal response to climate change remains controversial. Moreover, the mechanisms underlying body size shifts are poorly understood. Here, assuming that life history traits evolve to maximize fitness according to life history plasticity theory, we hypothesized that under global warming temperate multivoltine insects should emerge earlier with a smaller body mass in the early growing season, but emerge later with a larger body mass in the late season. We tested this hypothesis by conducting two field artificial warming experiments in an alpine meadow: 1) with one pre-dispersal seed predator species (tephritid flies, Tephritis femoralis) and its two host-plant species flowering in early and late growing seasons, respectively, and 2) with the tephritid flies and one host species with a flowering season that occupies parts of both the early and late growing seasons. These experiments were complemented by a microcosm chamber warming experiment, in which increasing and decreasing temperature trends were set to simulate temperature variation pattern in early and late growing seasons, respectively, but photoperiod was held constant. Warming generally advanced the adult emergence and decreased the body size (adult body mass) in the early season but delayed the emergence and increased the size in the late season in both field experiments, indicating that the seasonally different effects of warming on the fly body size was constant regardless of host-plant identity. The chamber warming resulted in consistent responses of emerging timing and body size to the simulated seasonal warming, demonstrating that the temperature increase per se and its interaction with direction of temperature change, but not other correlated effects, should be primarily responsible for the observed contrasting shifts of body size at different times of the season. Our results indicate that taking into account temperate seasonal patterns of temperature variation could be of general importance for predicting animal body size changes in the warmed future.

J	Sniegula, S; Golab, MJ; Johansson, F				Sniegula, Szymon; Golab, Maria J.; Johansson, Frank			Time constraint effects on phenology and life history synchrony in a damselfly along a latitudinal gradient	OIKOS												In organisms with complex life cycles living in seasonal environments, the synchronisation of phenological events is important from the ecological and evolutionary perspectives. Life history transitions should be synchronised to a greater degree at northern latitudes. We quantified hatching and emergence timing and synchrony in the obligate univoltine damselfly Lestes sponsa along a latitudinal gradient covering its entire north-south range in Europe. In our first experiment, populations from different latitudes were grown in separate climate chambers simulating temperature and photoperiod conditions occurring at their sites of origin. Northern populations expressed early and high synchronous hatching and emergence, central populations intermediate, and southern populations late and low synchronous hatching and emergence. This pattern was expressed at both population and full-sibling family levels, indicating stronger selection for timing and synchronisation in the north compared to the south. In our second experiment, populations from all latitudes were reared in conditions simulating an average temperature and photoperiod over the latitudinal gradient. Interestingly, the pattern of timing and synchronisation was reversed with respect to latitude when compared to the pattern shown in the first experiment, indicating the importance of environmental factors in shaping phenological events. Our results indicate strong selection for timing and synchronisation of life history events at northern latitudes, caused by time constraints. Our results also show that it is important to use as natural conditions as possible in experiments on life history shifts in organisms with complex life cycles in order to achieve a correct understanding of these shifts.

We show that calcium dramatically alters the conformation and activity of the myosin-VI motor implicated in pivotal steps of these processes. We resolved the change in motor conformation and in structural flexibility using single particle analysis of electron microscopic data and identified interacting domains using fluorescence spectroscopy. We discovered that calcium binding to calmodulin increases the binding affinity by a factor of 2,500 for a bipartite binding site on myosin-VI. The ability of calcium-calmodulin to seek out and bridge between binding site components directs a major rearrangement of the motor from a compact dormant state into a cargo binding primed state that is nonmotile. The lack of motility at high calcium is due to calmodulin switching to a higher affinity binding site, which leaves the original IQ-motif exposed, thereby destabilizing the lever arm. The return to low calcium can either restabilize the lever arm, required for translocating the cargo-bound motors toward the center of the cell, or refold the cargo-free motors into an inactive state ready for the next cellular calcium flux.																	0027-8424					MAR 1	2016	113	9					E1162	E1169		10.1073/pnas.1519435113								WOS:000371204500008	26811464

Metamorphosis of the invasive ascidian Ciona savignyi: environmental variables and chemical exposure	PEERJ												In this study, the effects of environmental variables on larval metamorphosis of the solitary ascidian Ciona savignyi were investigated in a laboratory setting. The progression of metamorphic changes were tracked under various temperature, photoperiod, substrate, larval density, and vessel size regimes. Metamorphosis was maximised at 18 degrees C, 12:12 h subdued light:dark, smooth polystyrene substrate, and 10 larvae mL(-1) in a twele-well tissue culture plate. Eliminating the air-water interface by filling culture vessels to capacity further increased the proportion of metamorphosed larvae; 87 +/- 5% of larvae completed metamorphosis within 5 days compated to 45 +/- 5% in control wells. The effects of the reference antifouling compounds polygodial, portimine, oroidin, chlorothalonil, and tolylfluanid on C. savignyi were subsequently determined, highlighting (1) the sensitivity of C. savignyi metamorphosis to chemical exposure and (2) the potential to use C. savignyi larvae to screen for bioactivity in an optimised laboratory setting. The compounds were bioactive in the low ng mL(-1) to high mu g mL(-1) range. Polygodial was chosen for addional investigations, where it was shown that mean reductions in the proportions of larvae reaching stage E were highly repeatable both within (repeatability = 14 +/- 9%) and between (intermediate precision = 17 +/- 3%) independent experiments. An environmental extra had no effect on the larvae but exposing larvae to both the extract and polygodial reduced potency relative to polygodial alone. This change in potency stresses the need for caution when working with complex samples, as is routinely implemented when isolating natural compounds from their biological source. Overall, the outcomes of this study highlight the sensitivity of C. savignyi metamorphosis to environmental variations and chemical exposure.																	2167-8359					FEB 25	2016	4								e1739	10.7717/peerj.1739								WOS:000371661700012	26966668

Large-Scale Modelling of the Environmentally-Driven Population Dynamics of Temperate Aedes albopictus (Skuse)	PLOS ONE												The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, is a highly invasive vector species. It is a proven vector of dengue and chikungunya viruses, with the potential to host a further 24 arboviruses. It has recently expanded its geographical range, threatening many countries in the Middle East, Mediterranean, Europe and North America. Here, we investigate the theoretical limitations of its range expansion by developing an environmentally-driven mathematical model of its population dynamics. We focus on the temperate strain of Ae. albopictus and compile a comprehensive literature-based database of physiological parameters. As a novel approach, we link its population dynamics to globally-available environmental datasets by performing inference on all parameters. We adopt a Bayesian approach using experimental data as prior knowledge and the surveillance dataset of Emilia-Romagna, Italy, as evidence. The model accounts for temperature, precipitation, human population density and photoperiod as the main environmental drivers, and, in addition, incorporates the mechanism of diapause and a simple breeding site model. The model demonstrates high predictive skill over the reference region and beyond, confirming most of the current reports of vector presence in Europe. One of the main hypotheses derived from the model is the survival of Ae. albopictus populations through harsh winter conditions. The model, constrained by the environmental datasets, requires that either diapausing eggs or adult vectors have increased cold resistance. The model also suggests that temperature and photoperiod control diapause initiation and termination differentially. We demonstrate that it is possible to account for unobserved properties and constraints, such as differences between laboratory and field conditions, to derive reliable inferences on the environmental dependence of Ae. albopictus populations.

Cerrado physiognomies, which range from savanna grasslands to forest formations, combined with the highly weathered, acidic clay Cerrado soils form a unique ecoregion. In this study, high-throughput sequencing of ribosomal RNA genes was combined with shotgun metagenomic analysis to explore the taxonomic composition and potential functions of soil microbial communities in four different vegetation physiognomies during both dry and rainy seasons. Our results showed that changes in bacterial, archaeal, and fungal community structures in cerrado denso, cerrado sensu stricto, campo sujo, and gallery forest soils strongly correlated with seasonal patterns of soil water uptake. The relative abundance of AD3, WPS-2, Planctomycetes, Thermoprotei, and Glomeromycota typically decreased in the rainy season, whereas the relative abundance of Proteobacteria and Ascomycota increased. In addition, analysis of shotgun metagenomic data revealed a significant increase in the relative abundance of genes associated with iron acquisition and metabolism, dormancy, and sporulation during the dry season, and an increase in the relative abundance of genes related to respiration and DNA and protein metabolism during the rainy season. These gene functional categories are associated with adaptation to water stress. Our results further the understanding of how tropical savanna soil microbial communities may be influenced by vegetation covering and temporal variations in soil moisture.

The planthoppers enter diapause in the third- or fourth-instar nymph stage, induced by short photoperiods and low temperatures. To investigate the geographic variation in L. striatellus diapause, we compared the incidence of nymphal diapause under various constant temperature (20 and 27 degrees C) and a photoperiod of 4: 20, 8: 16, 10: 14, 12: 12, 14: 10, and 16: 8 (L: D) h regimes among three populations collected from Hanoi (21.02 degrees N, 105.85 degrees E, northern Vietnam), Jiangyan (32.51 degrees N, 120.15 degrees E, eastern China), and Changchun (43.89 degrees N, 125.32 degrees E, north-eastern China). Our results indicated that there were significant geographic variations in the diapause of L. striatellus. When the original latitude of the populations increased, higher diapause incidence and longer critical photoperiod (CP) were exhibited. The CPs of the Jiangyan and Changchun populations were similar to 12 hr 30 min and 13 hr at 20 degrees C, and 11 hr and 11 hr 20 min at 27 degrees C, respectively. The second- and third-instar nymphs were at the stage most sensitive to the photoperiod. However, when the fourth- and fifth-instar nymphs were transferred to a long photoperiod, the diapause-inducing effect of the short photoperiod on young instars was almost reversed. The considerable geographic variations in the nymphal diapause of L. striatellus reflect their adaptation in response to a variable environment and provide insights to develop effective pest management strategies.																	1536-2442	2250-2645				FEB 2	2016	16									10.1093/jisesa/iev161								WOS:000369359100002	26839318					
J	Ortmans, W; Mahy, G; Monty, A				Ortmans, William; Mahy, Gregory; Monty, Arnaud			Effects of seed traits variation on seedling performance of the invasive weed, Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Seedling performance can determine the survival of a juvenile plant and impact adult plant performance. Understanding the factors that may impact seedling performance is thus critical, especially for annuals, opportunists or invasive plant species. Seedling performance can vary among mothers or populations in response to environmental conditions or under the influence of seed traits. However, very few studies have investigated seed traits variations and their consequences on seedling performance. Specifically, the following questions have been addressed by this work: 1) How the seed traits of the invasive Ambrosia artemisiifolia L vary among mothers and populations, as well as along the latitude; 2) How do seed traits influence seedling performance; 3) Is the influence on seedlings temperature dependent. With seeds from nine Western Europe ruderal populations, seed traits that can influence seedling development were measured. The seeds were sown into growth chambers with warmer or colder temperature treatments. During seedling growth, performance-related traits were measured. A high variability in seed traits was highlighted. Variation was determined by the mother identity and population, but not latitude. Together, the temperature, population and the identity of the mother had an effect on seedling performance. Seed traits had a relative impact on seedling performance, but this did not appear to be temperature dependent. Seedling performance exhibited a strong plastic response to the temperature, was shaped by the identity of the mother and the population, and was influenced by a number of seed traits.

J	Keena, MA				Keena, M. A.			Inheritance and World Variation in Thermal Requirements for Egg Hatch in Lymantria dispar (Lepidoptera: Erebidae)	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												Mode of inheritance of hatch traits in Lymantria dispar L. was determined by crossing populations nearly fixed for the phenotypic extremes. The nondiapausing phenotype was inherited via a single recessive gene and the phenotype with reduced low temperature exposure requirements before hatch was inherited via a single dominant gene. There was no evidence for sex-linkage or cytoplasmic effects with either gene. Eggs from 43 geographic populations were evaluated for hatch characteristics after being held for 60d at 5 degrees C followed by incubation at 25 degrees C. There was considerable variation both within and among the populations in the proportion able to hatch, time to first hatch, and average time to hatch. Egg masses with reduced requirement for low temperatures before the eggs were ready to hatch were present in all subspecies of L. dispar and the phenotype was not fixed in most populations. The populations clustered into three distinct groups, and climatic variables were found to be rough predictors of those groups. Variation in hatch phenotypes between populations is likely an adaptation to local climate and within a population provides a bet-hedging strategy to ensure that at least some hatch synchronizes with host leaf-out. Continued vigilance to prevent movement of populations both within and between countries is warranted, because some of the alleles that confer nondiapause or reduced low temperature requirements before egg hatch are not present in all populations and their introduction would increase variation in egg hatch within a population.

The LDT was determined to be 15 and 17 A degrees C, respectively, for the soybean-pod gall midge, Asphondylia yushimai Yukawa and Uechi, and the ampelopsis fruit-gall midge, A. baca Monzen. They are host-alternating multivoltine species, but their LDT did not differ between generations on winter-spring and summer-autumn hosts, supporting the hypothesis that the value of LDT is stable and species specific. Based on the LDT and the 50 % emergence dates (ET50) of an overwintered generation, we estimated the thermal constants from first instars to adults to be 47.4 day-degrees for A. yushimai and 164.9 day-degrees for A. baca. The estimated thermal constant enables A. yushimai to repeat many generations annually, which may support the possibility that the gall-midge infestation range expands every summer and autumn from southern to northern Honshu, where winter-spring hosts have never been detected. The larval development of A. yushimai and A. baca, as well as those of two other univoltine congeners, A. aucubae Yukawa and Ohsaki and A. sphaera Monzen, was delayed at temperatures of 26, 28, or 29 A degrees C. Global warming, when it becomes more prominent, will reduce the number of generations and the survival rate of multivoltine gall midges that spend summer without diapause.

As some individuals have prolonged diapause for more than a single year, population dynamics of this species is hard to understand. To decipher the mechanism of prolonged diapause and its role in population dynamics, we started a pest surveillance program in 1999 in a pine processionary population in the southern-central Alps of northern Italy, a recent range expansion zone for the species. The 16-year study used a pheromone trap network and four large rearing cages. We found some individuals could diapause for up to a maximum of seven years. With few exceptions, prolonged pupal diapause increased and retrieval rate of moth in cages decreased with increasing elevation. Moreover, we found prolonged diapausing individuals to emerge in advance of non-diapausing individuals. This trait allowed us to infer the proportion of prolonged diapausing individuals caught in the pheromone traps. Prolonged diapause was responsible for maintaining high population density for eight years in spite of annual applications of the biocontrol agent Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaid. This sustained density relied on individuals from cohorts before the application of insecticide started, and from cohorts not completely suppressed by the insecticide applications.

Identification of markers linked to genes for sprouting tolerance (independent of grain color) in hard white winter wheat (HWWW)	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS												Key message Hard red wheats can donate genes to hard white wheats for tolerance to preharvest sprouting, the effects are quantitative in nature, and may be tracked with previously described DNA markers. Pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) can negatively impact end-use quality and seed viability at planting. Due to preferences for white over red wheat in international markets, white wheat with PHS tolerance has become increasingly desired for worldwide wheat production. In general, however, red wheat is more tolerant of sprouting than white wheat. The main objective of this study was the identification of PHS tolerance conditioned by genes donated from hard red winter wheat, using markers applicable to the Great Plains hard white wheat gene pool. Three red wheat by white wheat populations, Niobrara/NW99L7068, NE98466/NW99L7068 and Jagalene/NW99L7068 were developed, and white-seeded progenies were analyzed for PHS tolerance and used to identify markers for the trait. In the three populations, marker loci with significant allelic effects were most commonly located on chromosomes of group 2, 3, 4 and 5, though additional markers were detected across the wheat genome. Chromosome 3A was the only chromosome with significant markers in all three populations. Markers were inconsistent across the three populations, and markers linked to tolerance-inducing loci were identified in both tolerant and susceptible parents. Additive effects of marker loci were common. In the present investigation, a wide range of PHS tolerance was observed, even though all lines were fixed for the recently reported positive TaPHS1 allele. PHS tolerance is controlled by additive major gene effects with minor gene effects where variations of minor gene effects were still unclear.																	0040-5752	1432-2242				FEB	2016	129	2					419	430		10.1007/s00122-015-2636-4								WOS:000368991100016	26687145

Departing from the broader theory of developmental disequilibrium, we launch the concept of urban hibernation to explain the process of periodic small-town regress. The conceptalong with its key stages and turning pointsis presented to the background of urbanization processes encountered in Poland. At the same time, the focus on small towns offers an alternative and more context-sensitive explication to eclectic development models inherent to larger cities. As such, we argue that the concept of urban hibernation is apt to serve as a more precise research and planning tool in the context of small towns, and particularly in the critical moments of rise and recession. By applying a historical perspective, we address the importance of proper identification of the various and ever-changing city-forming factors, including their role for spatial planning at different scales. Urban hibernation should thus be considered as an intrinsic part of the geographic environment, which, due to the volatility of its socio-economic components, transcends the traditional rural-urban divide. Our conceptual contribution may thus serve as a background for a fuller understanding of the variability and dynamics of intra-urban structures.

Population Dynamics of the Swallowtail Butterfly Battus polystictus polystictus (Butler) (Lepidoptera: Papilionidae) with Notes on Its Natural History	NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY												Battus polystictus (Butler) is a butterfly from the Neotropical region, occurring in the Atlantic Forest and Pampa biomes. It is commonly found in forest fragments surrounded by meadow formations, subjected to marked seasonal changes. Here, we report the population dynamics of B. polystictus at a high latitude environment and provide notes on its natural history. Population parameters were estimated on a 12-month mark-recapture program and the seasonality of resources investigated by exhaustive mapping of host-plants and flowers. The number of butterflies per day was not stable during the year, ranging from zero (winter) to 22 (summer); the sex ratio was always male biased (3M:1F). The age structure was not constant, with an increase of older individuals toward summer. The population density was positively correlated with temperature, relative humidity, and day length. The residence time was lower for males, while the vagility was lower for females; the increment of resources at forest edges seems to increase the likelihood of occurrence of both sexes. The results shown here suggest that South Brazilian populations of B. polystictus have high ecological demands for spring and summer conditions, avoiding winter in diapause.																	1519-566X	1678-8052				FEB	2016	45	1					33	43		10.1007/s13744-015-0341-2								WOS:000367197900005	26590142

Here we show high WNS prevalence both in Europe and on the West Siberian Plain in Asia. Palearctic bat communities tolerate similar fungal loads of Pseudogymnoascus destructans infection as their Nearctic counterparts and histopathology indicates equal focal skin tissue invasiveness pathognomonic for WNS lesions. Fungal load positively correlates with disease intensity and it reaches highest values at intermediate latitudes. Prevalence and fungal load dynamics in Palearctic bats remained persistent and high between 2012 and 2014. Dominant haplotypes of five genes are widespread in North America, Europe and Asia, expanding the source region of white-nose syndrome to non-European hibernacula. Our data provides evidence for both endemicity and tolerance to this persistent virulent fungus in the Palearctic, suggesting that host-pathogen interaction equilibrium has been established.

Variability in flowering, with or without vernalization, of European C. segetum populations situated along a 45-55 degrees North latitudinal gradient was studied. Long day requirement was confirmed. Vernalization requirements are not stringent in C. segetum the proportion of plants that were not sensitive or that responded strictly or weakly to vernalization varied across populations. The mean sum of growing degree days (GOD) for first flowering under a 14h day length at 15 degrees C was 1344 and 2072, with and without vernalization, respectively, whatever the population. A growth temperature at 25 degrees C had no effect on GDD except for a population from mountains. Advancing the date of harvest by ten days in a field experiment resulted in one-third fewer seeds produced, which could accelerate its decline, but polymorphism for vernalization and temperature responses could allow adaption.

Our objective was to define the pattern of internal oxidative changes in pomegranate seeds as dormancy was being broken by warm + cold stratification and by cold stratification alone. Embryos isolated from seeds after 1-42 days of warm stratification, after 56 days of warm stratification + 7, 28 or 56 days of cold stratification, and after 1-84 days of cold stratification alone, were used in biochemical tests. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), nitric oxide (NO), proline, lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation, and activities of the scavenging enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), hydrogen peroxide enzyme and peroxidase in the embryos were assessed by colorimetric methods. Our results indicated that warm + cold stratification had a stronger dormancy-breaking effect than cold stratification (85% versus 50% germination), which may be attributed to a higher yield of H2O2, NO, lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation in warm + cold stratification. Furthermore, warm + cold stratification-induced H2O2 change led to greater changes (elevation followed by attenuation) in activities of the scavenging enzymes than that induced by cold stratification alone. These results indicated that restriction of the level of reactive oxygen species change within a positive and safe range by such enzymes promoted seed germination. In addition, a relatively strong elevation of proline during warm + cold stratification also contributed to dormancy breakage and subsequent germination. In conclusion, the strong dormancy alleviating effect of warm + cold stratification on pomegranate seeds may be attributed to the corresponding active oxidative change via H2O2, NO, proline, malondialdehyde, protein carbonylation and scavenging enzymes.

REPRODUCTIVE TRAITS OF CHAETOPHILOSCIA ELONGATA (DOLLFUS, 1884) (ISOPODA, ONISCIDEA) AT MENZEL JMIL LAGOON (TUNISIA)	VIE ET MILIEU-LIFE AND ENVIRONMENT												Chaetophiloscia elongata Dollfus, 1884, an Holo-Mediterranean terrestrial isopod, is found in the Mediterranean regions but also on the coasts of the Black Sea. Its biology, population dynamics and life cycle were studied by monthly surveys performed from January 2010 to June 2011 at the banks of Menzel Jmil lagoon. The ovigerous females were present from February to November, suggesting that Chaetophiloscia elongata has a seasonal reproduction pattern. Female size was positively correlated with fecundity (number of eggs per brood) and fertility (numbers of embryos hatched per brood). Sex ratio was globally in favor of females (0.42). Analysis of the size frequency polymodal distribution showed that six cohorts were identified in the first sampling month and eleven new cohorts were detected during the next months. The length of newly born cohorts ranged from 1.32 to 1.78 mm. Lifespan was estimated at 8 to 10 months.																	0240-8759						2016	66	2					171	178										WOS:000389847000006

Trophic induction of diapause in native and invasive populations of Harmonia axyridis (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae)	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY												Ovipositing females from invasive (Krasnodar Territory of Russia) and native (Far East of Russia) populations of Harmonia axyridis were fed one of a set of diets ranging from 50 Myzus persicae aphids every day to 1 aphid every 10 days and all were also provided with a 10% sugar solution. The experiment was conducted at 20 degrees C under short (12 h) and long (18 h) day conditions. Most of the females from the native population that consumed 50 or 10 aphids per day continued to oviposit under both long and short day conditions. Females that consumed 1 aphid per day or every 2 days practically stopped laying eggs but under long day conditions their ovaries were still active, whereas under short day conditions ca 50% of them were reproductively inactive (only germaria present) and had a well-developed fat body. Further reduction in diet resulted in an increase in the proportion of reproductively inactive females. However, about half of the females that terminated oogenesis under long day conditions had poorly developed fat bodies, which indicates that diapause was not induced. For the females from the invasive population, both photoperiodic and trophic effects were weak: under short day conditions, some females entered diapause when prey was abundant, whereas about 50% (independent of photoperiod) did not enter diapause when starved. This risk-spreading strategy, possibly, facilitates the adaptation of this invasive ladybird to unpredictable environmental conditions.																	1802-8829						2016	113						469	475		10.14411/eje.2016.061								WOS:000390094600007

In the experiments, 5, 10, 20, 40 and 80 T. urticae eggs were given to the predatory mite for 24 hours. According to logistic regression analysis, N. californicus showed a Type II functional response at all RH levels. The attack rate (a) and the handling time (Th) of Type II response were calculated by fitting Holling Disc Equation to the data. These two coefficients were varied depending on the RH. The highest and the shortest, a and Th values were determined to be 1.636 and 0.031 at 50 and 70% RHs, respectively. While the lowest average daily mean numbers of eggs laid by N. californicus was found to be 0.33 at 30% RH and five prey density, the highest value was determined to be 3.10 at 70% RH and 80 prey density. Although, performance of N. californicus was influenced by the extreme RHs, the predator had successfully continued predation and oviposition activities under those conditions. Therefore, the N. californicus population should be included in augmentative biological control programs in which considerable range of humidity fluctuations is expected.

Cold hardiness and influences of hibernaculum conditions on overwintering survival of American dog tick larvae	TICKS AND TICK-BORNE DISEASES												Understanding how ticks survive the multitude of stresses experienced during winter is integral to predicting population dynamics and transmission of tick-borne pathogens. The American dog tick (Dermacentor variabilis), a predominant vector of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, overwinters in any of its post-egg life stages. In this study, we characterized the cold tolerance of larval D. variabilis and examined the effect of various acclimatory conditions on cold hardiness. Cold-shock survival during 2 h exposure to various subzero temperatures was assessed and a lower lethal temperature of -20 degrees C and a 50% mortality temperature near -16 degrees C was established. Larvae exposed to -5 degrees C showed high survival (similar to 70%) after 14 d and near 50% for up to 56 d at -5 degrees C. Larvae cycled between supra- and subzero temperatures showed better long-term survival than at constant -5 degrees C. The temperature of crystallization (T-c) was similar to-23 degrees C and no larvae survived freezing after reaching their T-c. Larvae exposed to inoculative freezing survived brief, mild treatments (70% survival of -5 degrees C for 2 h) but survival was reduced compared to larvae cooled in the absence of ice. Reduced photophase, rapid cold hardening, dehydration, and long-term thermal acclimation all improved larval cold hardiness to varying degrees. Survival data were compared to measurements of hibernacula conditions, and we conclude that larvae face little threat from cold-induced mortality but inoculative freezing does pose a risk, and the geographic distribution of D. variabilis is only minimally influenced by the ability of larvae to survive low temperature exposure.

Molecular Physiology of Mosquito Diapause	PROGRESS IN MOSQUITO RESEARCH	Advances in Insect Physiology											The dormant state of diapause is exploited by numerous mosquito species to survive seasonal periods of environmental stress. We discuss embryonic, larval and adult diapauses in mosquitoes and probe the molecular and physiological distinctions that comprise the diapause phenotype. Diapause evokes diverse and unique attributes including behavioural changes, arrested development, enhanced stress tolerance, fat accumulation and suppressed metabolic rates. Like most insects, mosquitoes in temperate latitudes precisely monitor daylength as a cue for diapause initiation. We examine the role of circadian clock genes in this response and trace downstream hormonal pathways involved in the diapause response. Insulin and the FOXO transcription factor signalling pathways appear to be keys for generating the diapause phenotype in adult females of Culex pipiens and perhaps other species. Elucidating the molecular regulation of diapause-associated physiology may provide a basis to identify novel targets for the control of mosquito vectors.																	0065-2806		978-0-12-802457-7				2016	51						329	361		10.1016/bs.aiip.2016.05.002								WOS:000383859500012

Collective roost of corvids in Melitopol (Zaporozhye region) in 2014-2015	VISNYK OF DNIPROPETROVSK UNIVERSITY-BIOLOGY ECOLOGY												The article contains the results of observations on the formation, existence and the dissociation of the collective winter roost of corvids (crow species) in 2014-2015 in Melitopol (Zaporozhye region). A detailed study of the concentration and the dynamics of its functioning during the winter period was carried out. By the method of absolute counting of birds, the estimation of the gathering process on the roost in the night and dispersal from roost in the morning was carried out twice a week (a total of 47 days of observation in the morning and evening). We selected the following essential parameters: time of the beginning and ending of the process of dispersal from the roost in the morning and gathering at the roost in the evening; time - study of birds' flight activity in these intervals; the number and species composition of birds; directions of flights with their mapping; weather conditions. Within the city of Melitopol during the winter period of 2014-2015, corvids (Rook, Western Jackdaw, Eurasian Magpie and Common Raven) form one central roost. The total number of birds at the roost was typically 18 thousand individuals. The collective roost exists from the beginning of October till the end of March. The analysis of dynamics of the birds' number during the existence of the collective showed a wide amplitude of fluctuation in the range of 1,000-5,000 individuals during autumn (10 times) and spring (5 times) migration. By the end of November migration ends, the number of birds has stabilized, and the location of the night roost becomes permanent. In winter the gathering is more stable and fluctuations in number lie within the limits of 500 individuals (8 times). The number of birds that roost collectively decreased from mid - March. In this article considerable attention is paid to processes of the birds' dispersal from the roost site and gathering at the roost at night. The observations showed a high degree of dependence on day length and different intensity of these types of daily activity. During the analysis of the process of morning dispersal of birds from the collective roost, seasonal differences in the time of dispersal were found. In the winter months this period was significantly shorter than in the autumn and spring. The duration of dispersal of birds from the roost (28.4 +/- 9 min; lim - 15-45 min) was reliably less than that of gathering at the roost (87.9 +/- 14.8 min; lim - 30-115 min); the difference of averages is significant for the highest probability threshold of p >= 0.001 for the entire observation period. As a result of research on dispersal and gathering of birds at the roost site, the basic strategies of the birds' behaviour were revealled. For morning dispersal of birds from the territory of the roost the strategy of "gathering with a pause" (16 registrations; 35.6%) is dominant. The strategy of "the damped wave" is sub dominant (14; 31.1%). The lowest percentage was taken up by the strategy of "three peaks" (1; 2.2%). For the evening gathering of birds at the roost, the strategy of "two peaks" is dominant. The lowest percentage was taken up by the strategy of "gathering with a pause" (2; 4.5%). The overall species diversity within a gathering and on the routes of birds' flights reached 24 species. The undisputed dominant in numbers was the Rook, and the subdominan was the Jackdaw. Thus, corvids form the basis of the ornithological complex of the forest - park zone of Melitopol in the autumn and spring period.																	2310-0842	2312-301X					2016	24	1					50	60		10.15421/011606								WOS:000382979500006

The effect of host trees on the cold hardiness of A. glabripennis larvae could be the basis for predicting the performance of this forest pest on different common hosts. To evaluate the effect of different species of host plant on the cold hardiness of overwintering larvae of A. glabripennis, we measured the supercooling point (SCP), fresh mass, protein content and concentrations of low molecular weight substances in overwintering larvae collected from three different host species (i.e., Populus opera, Populus tomentosa and Salix matsudana). Mean SCPs and protein contents of larvae from these three hosts differed significantly. The SCPs and protein contents of the larvae collected from P. opera and P. tomentosa were significantly higher than those collected from S. matsudana. The concentrations of glycerol, glucose and trehalose in overwintering larvae collected from these host species also differed significantly, but there were no significant differences in the concentrations of sorbitol and inositol. The larvae that were collected from S. matsudana had the highest concentrations of glycerol and trehalose and those from P. opera the lowest contents of glycerol, whereas those from P. tomentosa had the lowest concentrations of trehalose but the highest concentrations of glucose. Because of the signifi cant differences in the quantities of these biochemical substances in their bodies, the cold hardiness of overwintering larvae of A. glabripennis was significantly dependent on the tree they fed on. These effects on the cold hardiness of the overwintering larvae might affect the selection of a host tree and therefore the spread of this beetle.																	1802-8829						2016	113						212	216		10.14411/eje.2016.026								WOS:000380706700025

EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY												Climate change scenarios predict losses of cold-adapted species from insular locations, such as middle high mountains at temperate latitudes, where alpine habitats extend for a few hundred meters above the timberline. However, there are very few studies following the fates of such species in the currently warming climate. We compared transect monitoring data on an alpine butterfly, Erebia epiphron (Nymphalidae: Satyrinae) from summit elevations of two such alpine islands (above 1300 m) in the Jesenik Mts and Krkonose Mts, Czech Republic. We asked if population density, relative total population abundance and phenology recorded in the late 1990s (past) differs that recorded early in 2010s (present) and if the patterns are consistent in the two areas, which are separated by 150 km. We found that butterfly numbers recorded per transect walk decreased between the past and the present, but relative population abundances remained unchanged. This contradictory observation is due to an extension in the adult flight period, which currently begins ca 10 days earlier and lasts for longer, resulting in the same total abundances with less prominent peaks in abundance. We interpret this development as desynchronization of annual cohort development, which might be caused by milder winters with less predictable snow cover and more variable timing of larval diapause termination. Although both the Jesenik and Krkonose populations of E. epiphron are abundant enough to withstand such desynchronization, decreased synchronicity of annual cohort development may be detrimental for innumerable small populations of relic species in mountains across the globe.

The ability of a pest species to colonize new areas depends on its ability to adjust the timing of phenological events in its life cycle, particularly at high latitudes where there is marked seasonality in temperature and day length. Here we incubated eggs of three species of geometrid moth, Epirrita autumnata, Operophtera brumata and Erannis defoliaria from different geographical populations (E. autumnata and O. brumata from Northern Finland, E. autumnata and E. defoliaria from Southern Finland and all three species from Germany) in a climate chamber at a constant temperature to determine the relative importance of geographic origin in the timing of egg hatch measured in terms of cumulative temperature sums (degree days above 5 degrees C, DD5); i.e. the relative importance of local adaptation versus phenotypic plasticity in the timing of egg hatch. In all three species, eggs from northern populations required a significantly lower temperature sum for hatching than eggs from southern populations, but the differences between them in temperature sum requirements varied considerably among species, with the differences being largest for the earliest hatching and northernmost species, E. autumnata, and smallest for the southern, late-hatching E. defoliaria. In addition, the difference in hatch timing between the E. autumnata eggs from Southern Finland and Germany was many times greater than the difference between the two Finnish populations of E. autumnata, despite the fact that the geographical distances between these populations is similar. We discuss how these differences in hatching time may be explained by the differences in hatch-budburst synchrony and its importance for different moth species and populations. We also briefly reflect on the significance of photoperiod, which is not affected by climate change. It is a controller that works parallel or in addition to temperature sum both for egg hatch in moths and bud burst of their host plants.

Effect of geographic origin of Spodoptera exigua (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) and sugar beet cultivar on nutritional indices of this pest	ISJ-INVERTEBRATE SURVIVAL JOURNAL												Nutritional indices of three geographic populations (Miandoab, Moghan and Kalposh) of the fifth instar of Spodoptera exigua (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) on four sugar beet cultivars (Dorothea, Rozier, Persia and Perimer) were evaluated at 25 +/- 1 degrees C, 65 +/- 5 % RH and a 16:8 L:D photoperiod. The estimates of all the nutritional indices were affected by the interaction effect of the geographic population and the sugar beet cultivars. Miandoab population reared on Dorothea, and Moghan and Kalposh populations reared on Perimer had the highest approximate digestibility (AD). Miandoab and Kalposh populations reared on Rozier showed the highest efficiency of conversion of ingested food (ECI) and efficiency of conversion of digested food (ECD) values. Moghan population reared on Persia showed the lowest AD values and the highest ECI and ECD values. The present study showed that the nutritional indices of three populations, in most cases, were significantly different from with other, due to different environmental conditions that the pest collected from there. It is concluded that both geographic origins of the pest and host cultivar affected the nutritional indices of S. exigua larvae.																	1824-307X						2016	13						221	228										WOS:000381619600019

Diapause in ticks of the medically important Ixodes ricinus species complex	TICKS AND TICK-BORNE DISEASES												Four members of the Ixodes ricinus species complex, Ixodes pacificus, Ixodes persulcatus, Ixodes ricinus and Ixodes scapularis, have, between them, a worldwide distribution within the northern hemisphere. They are responsible for the transmission of several animal and human pathogens, including the causal agents of Lyme borreliosis, tick-borne encephalitis, human granulocytic anaplasmosis and human babesiosis. Despite the importance of these ticks as vectors, the knowledge and understanding of the role that diapause plays in their complex life cycles are confused and incomplete. In view of the continuing geographic spread of these tick species, as well as the effects of climate change on vector-borne diseases, it is timely to encourage research on diapause phenomena to improve understanding of their biology and of pathogen transmission dynamics. In our review we seek to clarify thinking on the topic and to address gaps in our knowledge that require the attention of researchers. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

Vitrification as one of the cryopreservation technique has been applied to a wide range of plant materials since it offers various advantages in terms of great recovery, a simplistic protocol and high levels of recovery growth. This study seeks to address the response of two in vitro grown cassava accessions (450 and 433) to vitrification and modification of vitrification. laminar air dried (dehydration) techniques and their recovery after immersion in liquid nitrogen. Explants were successfully grown from both techniques. The best result obtained from treatment pre. cultured on PT medium: MS inorganic medium supplemented with 1 M sorbitol, 0.1 M sucrose, 0.1 M DMSO, 0.05 mg . L-1 BAP, 0.05 mg . L-1 GA3, 0.01 mg . L-1 NAA and CS vitamins solidified with 2 g . L-1 phytagel, for 3 d at the dark condition. Pre. cultured explants dehydrated in laminar air flow 10 min at 25 degrees C and then osmoprotectant on CP medium: MS liquid medium supplemented with 0.1 M sucrose, 1 M sorbitol, 1.28 M DMSO, for 20 min at 25 degrees C. After changing the solution with fresh CP solution, explants were directly plunged into liquid nitrogen for minimal 1 h, followed by rapid warming at 37 degrees C for 2 min then directly transferred onto recovery medium: MS inorganic medium supplemented with CS. vit, 0.02 mg .

(Dilixellus) neglectus Fremuth, 1983 (Curculionidae: Lixinae: Lixini) are described and compared with known larvae of 21 other Lixus and 2 Hypolixus taxa. The mature larva and pupa of L. bituberculatus are the first immature stages described representing the subgenus Ortholixus. The larva of L. neglectus, in the subgenus Dilixellus, is distinguished from the known larvae of four species in this subgenus by having more pigmented sclerites on the larval body. All descriptions of mature larvae from the tribe Lixini, as do all known species from the tribe Cleonini, fit the diagnosis of the mature larva of the Lixinae subfamily. Furthermore, new biological information of these species in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Romania is provided. For L. bituberculatus, a chicory, Cichorium intybus L. (Asteraceae), is identified as a host plant, and L. neglectus is found on dock Rumex thyrsiflorus Fingerh. (Polygonaceae). Both species are probably monophagous or oligophagous. Adults of L. bituberculatus often inhabit host plants growing in active, dry and sunny pastures with sparse patches without vegetation, being mostly active during the night in April/May and then again in September, when the highest activity levels are observed. Adults of L. neglectus inhabit dry grasslands on sandy soils with host plants, being active during the day from May to September, with the highest level of activity in May/June and September. The larvae of both species are borers in the stem and root of the host plant, and they pupate in root or root neck. Adults leave the pupation cells at the end of summer and do not hibernate in the host plants. Finally, Romania is a new geographic record for L. bituberculatus.

In high- latitude environments it encounters strong evolutionary pressure to adapt to low temperatures due to high overwintering mortality and periodic influx of new individuals from more southern populations. Our study focused on gathering evidence for such a range shift leading to the formation of a permanent local population. The phenology and overwintering success of beetles was investigated from 2008 to 2015. Depending on weather conditions in the different years, the overwintered beetles emerged from the soil from the beginning of May to mid- June. Over 700 degree days accumulated in 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2014 exceeding the limit needed for development of two generations. However, food supply and temperature distribution in the growing period enabled development of the second complete generation only in 2010 and 2013. Survival of overwintering beetles in field conditions varied between 18% and 47% in the different years. Winter mortality was not associated with low air temperature in any year as snow cover provided the necessary protection and winter soil temperatures at the depth of 30 cm remained at around 0 degrees C for the duration of the whole observation period, with only some records as low as -3.5 degrees C. The survival of overwintering beetles is more likely defined by factors other than low temperature. As a result of periodic invasions of beetles with naturally lower cold resistance originating from southern regions, the structure of the overwintering population in Nordic temperate conditions is not homogeneous. Moreover, this may also be derived from cultural practices, as commercial producers regularly apply agrochemicals while organic growers avoid them.																	0906-4710	1651-1913					2016	66	6					502	509		10.1080/09064710.2016.1183701								WOS:000378340200005

Contributions of dynamic environmental signals during life-cycle transitions to early life-history traits in lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl.)	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Environmental signals are important triggers in the life-cycle transitions and play a crucial role in the life-history evolution. Yet very little is known about the leading ecological factors contributing to the variations of life-history traits in perennial plants. This paper explores both the causes and consequences for the evolution of life-history traits (i.e., seed dormancy and size) in lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl.) across British Columbia (B.C.), Canada. We selected 83 logepole pine populations covering 22 ecosystem zones of B.C. and through their geographic coordinate, 197 climatic variables were generated accordingly for the reference (1961-1990) and future (2041-2070) periods. We found that dynamic climatic variables rather than constant geographic variables are the true environmental driving forces in seed dormancy and size variations and thus provide reliable predictors in response to global climate change. Evapotranspiration and precipitation in the plant-to-seed chronology are the most critical climate variables for seed dormancy and size variations, respectively. Hence, we predicted that levels of seed dormancy in lodgepole pine would increase across large tracts of B.C. in 2050s. Winter-chilling is able to increase the magnitude of life-history plasticity and lower the bet-hedge strategy in the seed-to-plant transition; however, winter-chilling is likely to be insufficient in the north of 49A degrees aEuro-N in 2050s, which may delay germination while unfavorable conditions during dry summers may result in adverse consequences in the survival of seedlings owing to extended germination span. These findings provide useful information to studies related to assessments of seed transfer and tree adaptation.

We compared long-term patterns of concentrations and fluxes of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic (DON) and inorganic nitrogen (DIN) in aquatic ecosystems of the Arbutus Lake watershed to evaluate how a lake nested in a forested watershed affects the sources (e.g., production) and sinks (e.g., retention) of DOC and DON in the Adirondack Mountains of New York, USA. We observed no significant long-term changes of DOC and DON in the lake outlet since 1983 and 1994, respectively. However, the temporal patterns of DOC and DON concentrations in the lake inlet showed significant seasonality such as increases during the vegetation growing season along with notable decreases in the dormant season. A comparison of mass balances between inlet and outlet for the period from 2000 to 2009 suggested that the lake was a sink of DOC (mean of influx minus out flux: +1140 mol C ha(-1) yr(-1)). In contrast, the difference of discharge-weighted DON concentrations (mean of inlet minus outlet: 1.0 mu mol N L-1) between inlet and outlet was much smaller than the discharge-weighted DOC concentrations (average of inlet minus outlet: + 87 mu mol C L-1). DON fluxes showed considerable variation among years (mean of influx minus outflux: +8 mol N ha(-1) yr(-1); range of differences: -15 to 27 mol N ha(-1) yr(-1)). DON exhibited low percent retention ((influx-outflux)/influx) (mean: 6.9 %, range: 34.8 to +31.2) compared to DOC (mean: 30.1 %, range: +9.2 to +44.1). The resultant increase of DON within the lake was closely linked with a net decrease of DIN through monthly Pearson correlation analysis, suggesting the importance of biotic factors in mediating lake DON dynamics Our results show different relative retentions of DOC compared with DON, along with a larger retention of DIN than DON, suggesting that DOC and DON might display substantially different biogeochemical relationships in oligo-mesotrophic lakes nested forested watersheds and therefore different roles for a sink behavior for DOC compared to a producer of DON.

It requires immediate action to seek new antitubercular compounds and devise alternate strategies. Nanomaterials, in the present scenario, have opened new avenues in medicine, diagnosis, and therapeutics. In view of this, the current study aims to determine the efficacy of phytogenic metal nanoparticles to inhibit mycobacteria. Methods: Silver (AgNPs), gold (AuNPs), and gold-silver bimetallic (Au-AgNPs) nanoparticles synthesized from medicinal plants, such as Barleria prionitis, Plumbago zeylanica, and Syzygium cumini, were tested against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and M. bovis BCG. In vitro and ex vivo macrophage infection model assays were designed to determine minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and half maximal inhibitory concentration of nanoparticles. Microscopic analyses were carried out to demonstrate intracellular uptake of nanoparticles in macrophages. Besides this, biocompatibility, specificity, and selectivity of nanoparticles were also established with respect to human cell lines. Results: Au-AgNPs exhibited highest antitubercular activity, with MIC of <2.56 mu g/mL, followed by AgNPs. AuNPs did not show such activity at concentrations of up to 100 mu g/mL. In vitro and ex vivo macrophage infection model assays revealed the inhibition of both active and dormant stage mycobacteria on exposure to Au-AgNPs. These nanoparticles were capable of entering macrophage cells and exhibited up to 45% cytotoxicity at 30 mu g/mL (ten times MIC concentration) after 48 hours. Among these, Au-AgNPs synthesized from S. cumini were found to be more specific toward mycobacteria, with their selectivity index in the range of 94-108. Conclusion: This is the first study to report the antimycobacterial activity of AuNPs, AgNPs, and Au-AgNPs synthesized from medicinal plants. Among these, Au-AgNPs from S. cumini showed profound efficiency, specificity, and selectivity to kill mycobacteria. These should be investigated further to develop novel TB nanoantibiotics.																	1178-2013						2016	11									10.2147/IJN.S102488								WOS:000375559600001

The Victoria Land region is rich in lakes and ponds and spans 8 degrees of latitude that encompasses gradients in factors such as solar radiation, temperature, ice cover and day length. An understanding of the links between latitudinally driven environmental and biodiversity changes is essential to the understanding of the ecology and evolution of Antarctic biota and the formulation of hypotheses about likely future changes in biodiversity. As several studies have demonstrated that photosynthetic pigments are an excellent, although underused, tool for the study of lacustrine algal communities, the aim of the present study was to investigate variations in algal biomass and biodiversity across the latitudinal gradient of Victoria Land using sedimentary pigments. We test the hypothesis that the biodiversity of freshwater environments decreases as latitude increases. On the basis of our results, we propose using the number of sedimentary pigments as a proxy for algal diversity and the sum of chlorophyll a and bacteriochlorophyll a with their degradation derivatives as an index of biomass. Overall, our data show that biomass and diversity decrease as latitude increases but local environmental conditions, in particular, natural levels of eutrophy, can affect both productivity and diversity.																	0800-0395	1751-8369					2016	35								20703	10.3402/polar.v35.20703								WOS:000376254900001

ANNUAL REVIEW OF ENTOMOLOGY, VOL 61	Annual Review of Entomology											Plastic responses figure prominently in discussions on insect adaptation to climate change. Here we review the different types of plastic responses and whether they contribute much to adaptation. Under climate change, plastic responses involving diapause are often critical for population persistence, but key diapause responses under dry and hot conditions remain poorly understood. Climate variability can impose large fitness costs on insects showing diapause and other life cycle responses, threatening population persistence. In response to stressful climatic conditions, insects also undergo ontogenetic changes including hardening and acclimation. Environmental conditions experienced across developmental stages or by prior generations can influence hardening and acclimation, although evidence for the latter remains weak. Costs and constraints influence patterns of plasticity across insect clades, but they are poorly understood within field contexts. Plastic responses and their evolution should be considered when predicting vulnerability to climate change-but meaningful empirical data lag behind theory.

A Dynamic Population Model to Investigate Effects of Climate and Climate-Independent Factors on the Lifecycle of Amblyomma americanum (Acari: Ixodidae)	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY												The lone star tick, Amblyomma americanum, is a disease vector of significance for human and animal health throughout much of the eastern United States. To model the potential effects of climate change on this tick, a better understanding is needed of the relative roles of temperature-dependent and temperature-independent (day-length-dependent behavioral or morphogenetic diapause) processes acting on the tick lifecycle. In this study, we explored the roles of these processes by simulating seasonal activity patterns using models with site-specific temperature and day-length-dependent processes. We first modeled the transitions from engorged larvae to feeding nymphs, engorged nymphs to feeding adults, and engorged adult females to feeding larvae. The simulated seasonal patterns were compared against field observations at three locations in United States. Simulations suggested that 1) during the larva-to-nymph transition, some larvae undergo no diapause while others undergo morphogenetic diapause of engorged larvae; 2) molted adults undergo behavioral diapause during the transition from nymph-to-adult; and 3) there is no diapause during the adult-to-larva transition. A model constructed to simulate the full lifecycle of A. americanum successfully predicted observed tick activity at the three U.S. study locations. Some differences between observed and simulated seasonality patterns were observed, however, identifying the need for research to refine some model parameters. In simulations run using temperature data for Montreal, deterministic die-out of A. americanum populations did not occur, suggesting the possibility that current climate in parts of southern Canada is suitable for survival and reproduction of this tick.																	0022-2585	1938-2928				JAN	2016	53	1					99	115		10.1093/jme/tjv150								WOS:000371907700012	26502753					
J	Dos Santos, CF; Nunes-Silva, P; Blochtein, B				Dos Santos, Charles F.; Nunes-Silva, Patricia; Blochtein, Betina			Temperature Rise and Its Influence on the Cessation of Diapause in Plebeia droryana, a Eusocial Bee (Hymenoptera: Apidae)	ANNALS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												Climate warming in the coming decades may affect diapause in insect species which use it to survive unfavorable winter conditions. Plebeia droryana (Friese) (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Meliponini) is a highly eusocial bee species that exhibits reproductive diapause and inhabits southern South America where winter temperatures may fall below 10A degrees C, or even below 0A degrees C in extreme years. In this paper, we evaluate whether P. droryana might terminate diapause during winter under laboratory conditions. We initially kept colonies of P. droryana at 8A degrees C in a biochemical oxygen demand chamber, and then raised the temperature by 2A degrees C every 3 d until the cessation of diapause was detected, as indicated by the onset of brood cell building and subsequent egg-laying by queens. We found that the termination of diapause in P. droryana could be achieved at temperatures between 16A degrees C and 22A degrees C, resulting in typical postdiapause brood cell building and egg-laying rates. Our binomial generalized linear mixed model indicated that only temperature, but no time or temperature-time interaction, explained the probability of termination of diapause in P. droryana. Again, only temperature, but no time or temperature-time interaction, significantly affected amount of brood cell built postdiapause in this species. These data suggest that the levels of predicted climate warming in the geographic range of P. droryana over the coming decades will probably result in these populations abandoning diapause behavior. These results have important implications regarding the ecological service of crop and wild plant pollination provided by this species.				dos Santos, Charles/F-8617-2012; Blochtein, Betina/B-9412-2014; Nunes-Silva, Patricia/B-2671-2013	dos Santos, Charles/0000-0001-5181-2461; Blochtein, Betina/0000-0001-8452-1716; Nunes-Silva, Patricia/0000-0002-9215-9822												0013-8746	1938-2901				JAN	2016	109	1					29	34		10.1093/aesa/sav096								WOS:000371679400004

Red fluorescence in coral larvae is associated with a diapause-like state	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Effective dispersal across environmental gradients is the key to species resilience to environmental perturbation, including climate change. Coral reefs are among the most sensitive ecosystems to global warming, but factors predicting coral dispersal potential remain unknown. In a reef-building coral Acropora millepora, larval fluorescence emerged as a possible indicator of dispersal potential since it correlates with responsiveness to a settlement cue. Here, we show that gene expression in red fluorescent larvae of A.millepora is correlated with diapause-like characteristics highly likely to be associated with extended dispersal. We compared gene expression among three larval fluorescent morphs under three coloured light treatments. While colour morphs did not differ in their gene expression responses to light colour, red larvae demonstrated gene expression signatures of cell cycle arrest and decreased transcription accompanied by elevated ribosome production and heightened defenses against oxidative stress. A meta-analysis revealed that this profile was highly similar to the signatures of elevated thermal tolerance in the same coral species, and moreover, functionally resembled diapause states in an insect and a nematode. Our results support a connection between red fluorescence and long-range dispersal, which offers a new perspective on the molecular underpinnings of coral larval dispersal and the biological function of GFP-like fluorescent proteins.

In plants, environmental shifts that occur due to colonization of a novel environment may require adaptive changes in the timing of growth and flowering, which are often governed by location-specific environmental cues such as day length. We studied locally varying selection in 19 flowering time loci in nine populations of the perennial herb Arabidopsis lyrata, which has a wide but patchy distribution in temperate and boreal regions of the northern hemisphere. The populations differ in their recent population demographic and colonization histories and current environmental conditions, especially in the growing season length. We searched for population-specific molecular signatures of directional selection by comparing a set of candidate flowering time loci with a genomic reference set within each population using multiple approaches and contrasted the patterns of different populations. The candidate loci possessed approximately 20% of the diversity of the reference loci. On average the flowering time loci had more rare alleles (a smaller Tajima's D) and an excess of highly differentiated sites relative to the reference, suggesting positive selection. The strongest signal of selection was detected in photoperiodic pathway loci in the colonizing populations of Northwestern Europe, whereas no evidence of positive selection was detected in the Central European populations. These findings emphasized the population-specific nature of selection and suggested that photoperiodic adaptation was important during postglacial colonization of the species.

These changes were mostly brought about by phenotypic plasticity, i.e. flexible reactions of individual birds, rather than by microevolutionary change. Knowing the limits of plasticity is thus of paramount importance in any attempt to predict possible reactions of birds to climate warming. However, the breeding performance of the same individuals in contrasting environmental conditions, necessary to answer this question, is rarely observed. Here, we provide data on the flexibility in timing of egg-laying of individual marsh tit Poecile palustris females breeding in an extremely late (2013) and early (2014) spring in Biaowiea National Park (Poland). In both years the birds stayed in the same places in the primeval old-growth forest, free of direct human influences (no nest-boxes, no additional food). The weather variation was within the range of conditions observed during 40 yr in the study area, and no climate warming occurred in the marsh tit's pre-breeding period. Females (n = 16) shifted the onset of laying by 13-23 (median = 20) days between the seasons. This range of individual flexibility encompasses almost the whole latitudinal range of the breeding dates found across Europe. Such a buffer of plasticity would probably be sufficient for marsh tits to adjust the onset of egg-laying to the forecasted range of climate change. A combination of temperature and photoperiod appears to be involved in fine tuning of the birds' breeding times with spring conditions, but how the birds asses and integrate this information remains poorly understood.

Breaking and remaking a seed and seed predator interaction in the introduced range of Scotch Broom (Cytisus scoparius) in New Zealand	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1. Introduced plants may initially experience enemy release, but some of those interactions may be reinstated through biological control. These cases provide opportunities to explore the dynamics of broken and remade consumer-resource interactions. 2. The European shrub broom (Cytisus scoparius) was introduced to New Zealand without a specialist seed predator (Bruchidius villosus) until a biological control programme reinstated this interaction in 1988. 3. Broom produces substantially larger seeds throughout its non-native range, and there are differences in seedling establishment beneath broom canopies between the native and introduced ranges. We hypothesized that large broom seeds produce seedlings with a survival advantage in shaded conditions, consistent with establishment under broom canopies in the introduced range. We also predicted that the seed-feeding beetle would experience increased fitness in larger seeds. 4. We found that seedling survival was correlated with seed weight in shaded conditions, consistent with the observed establishment of seedlings beneath broom stands in the non-native range. 5. Beetle size was positively correlated with seed weight, and female fecundity increased with body size. Comparison of the size distributions of beetle populations before and after hibernation provided indirect evidence that overwintering survival of beetles is also size-dependent. These findings are consistent with observed higher levels of abundance of B. villosus in New Zealand, compared to native habitats. 6. Selection gradients for seed size-dependent seedling survival on broom occupancy were explored using the Rees-Paynter population model, demonstrating that a fitness benefit to the plant of large seed size through enhanced seedling survival beneath the parental canopy is only likely under lowdisturbance scenarios and moderate fecundity levels. 7. Synthesis. The dynamics of biocontrol systems provide an underexploited opportunity to examine the impact of removal and reinstatement of species interactions. Differences in seed size between native and non-native ranges may result from varying intensities of conflicting selection pressures acting on seed size. It remains to be seen whether a decline in seed size towards that seen in the native range will result from the biocontrol agent introduction, as we have demonstrated that selection pressures on seed size vary with disturbance-mediated population turnover and fecundity.

But climate change is expected to significantly influence plant reproduction, affecting seed availability and viability as well as planting opportunities. Meeting growing restoration targets within these constraints in new and unfamiliar climates will be challenging. Consequently, we need to develop a range of flexible strategies to ensure that sufficient volumes of viable seed are available to take advantage of planting opportunities under novel environmental scenarios. This requires coordinated leadership to align funding and planting timelines, using seed production areas to improve seed supply, building and maintaining infrastructure to stockpile seed, encouraging research to overcome storage and germination constraints, and developing and implementing new technologies in all of these areas. Increased tolerance to risk and failure will also be required as the application of current restoration practices may not be appropriate as the climate changes.																	0006-3568	1525-3244				JAN	2016	66	1					73	79		10.1093/biosci/biv155								WOS:000368315900010

Time constraints cause strong selection on life-history traits, because populations need to complete their life cycles within a shorter time. We therefore expect lower genetic variation in these traits in high-than in low-latitude populations, since the former are more time-constrained. 2. The aim was to estimate life-history traits and their genetic variation in an obligately univoltine damselfly along a latitudinal gradient of 2730 km. 3. Populations were grown in the laboratory at temperatures and photoperiods simulating those at their place of origin. In a complementary experiment, individuals from the same families were grown in constant temperature and photoperiod that mimicked average conditions across the latitude. 4. Development time and size was faster and smaller, respectively, and growth rate was higher at northern latitudes. Additive genetic variance was very low for life-history traits, and estimates for egg development time and larval growth rate showed significant decreases towards northern latitudes. The expression of genetic effects in life-history traits differed considerably when individuals were grown in constant rather than simulated and naturally variable conditions. 5. Our results support strong selection by time constraints. They also highlight the importance of growing organisms in their native environment for correct estimates of genetic variance at their place of origin. Our results also suggest that the evolutionary potential of life-history traits is very low at northern compared to southern latitudes, but that changes in climate could alter this pattern.

These precious pollinators are known to be declining worldwide, and one major factor contributing to this decline are infections by parasites. Knowledge about parasites in wild bumblebee populations is thus of paramount importance for conservation purposes. We here report the geographical distribution of Crithidia and Nosema, two common parasites of bumblebees, in a yet poorly investigated country: Mexico. Based on sequence divergence of the Cytochrome b and Glycosomal glyceraldehyde phosphate deshydrogenase (gGPDAH) genes, we discovered the presence of a new Crithidia species, which is mainly distributed in the southern half of the country. It is placed by Bayesian inference as a sister species to C. bombi. We suggest the name Crithidia mexicana for this newly discovered organism. A population of C expoeki was encountered concentrated on the flanks of the dormant volcanic mountain, Iztaccihuatl, and microsatellite data showed evidence of a bottleneck in this population. This study is the first to provide a large-scale insight into the health status of endemic bumblebees in Mexico, based on a large sample size (n = 3,285 bees examined) over a variety of host species and habitats.

A Critical Examination of Timing of Burning in the Kansas Flint Hills	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT												Frequent burning is a crucial ecological and economic component of the Kansas Flint Hills. Although burning is important for the preservation of tallgrass prairie and improving livestock production, it has becomea controversial societal issue because of its potential impact on air quality standards. Over the past 80 years, recommendations on burning in Kansas have ranged from total fire exclusion to burning only in late April; and for the past 40 years, the concept that burning should only occur in late spring has become ingrained in the cultural practices of rangeland management. Yet the scientific basis for these recommendations has received little rigorous scrutiny. Herein, we critically review the research on dormant-season burning in the Flint Hills that formed the foundation for modern burn practices in Kansas. Close examination of the historical data does not support the tenet that burning must be limited to a narrow window in late spring. Many conclusions of the research that led to recommending burning only in late spring were ambiguous, not subjected to statistical analysis, or were influenced by an antiburn bias. Current research suggests that timing of a burn is not as critical as ranchers have been led to believe and burning does not have to be restricted to a narrow window in late April. There is an absence of scientific evidence that burning earlier in the spring adversely affects forage production, plant species composition, soil moisture, or cattle weight gain. Although there is a need for research on the consequences of burning grazed pastures at different times of the year, expanding the window for burning earlier in the dormant season should help alleviate air quality issues downwind of the burned areas and potentially be beneficial to ranchers.

With respect to biomass cultivation, temperature affected biomass productivity but not final biomass concentration. Scenario I mediated faster ammonium and phosphate removal (100% for all the evaluated scenarios) and greater organic matter removal (80.5% compared to 56.5% and 70.8% obtained for Scenario II and III, respectively). Biomass grown under unfavorable conditions of light and temperature (Scenario III) evidenced the highest nitrogen assimilation due to the lowest ammonia stripping (6%). Different cultivation scenarios resulted in a different macromolecular profile of the harvested biomass. Carbohydrates accumulation prevailed under Scenario I while low temperature (Scenario II) and short photoperiod (Scenario HI) increased lipid and protein content. Harvested biomass was subjected to anaerobic digestion. Anaerobic biodegradability of the three types of biomass remained in the narrow range of 36-42%, however different hydrolysis constant rates were calculated. Comparison between the theoretically calculated and experimentally obtained methane yield values showed that biomass collected at Scenario III only reached 36.1% of the theoretical methane yield achievable compared to 46.5% attained with the biomass collected at Scenario I. Further research on microalgae communities and cell wall composition is required to understand the methane yield mismatch. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this respect, identifying factors affecting operational costs and availability are vital for wind farm operators to achieve the most profitable decisions. Many OWFs are built in stages and the important factors may not be consistent for the different phases. To address this issue, three OWF case studies are defined to represent two phases and a complete project. An initial qualitative screening sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify the most important factors of O&M affecting operating cost and availability. The study concluded that the important factors for total O&M cost were access and repair costs along with failure rates for both minor and major repairs. For time-based availability, the important factors identified were those related to the length of time conducting the maintenance tasks, i.e. the operation duration and the working day length. It was found that the two stages had similar results, but these were different compared to the complete project. In this case, the results provide valuable information to OWF operators during the project development and decision making process. (c) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Diapause research plays an important role in the artificial propagation and shelf-life extension of insect products. Although this lady beetle's regulatory, physiological and biochemical characteristics in the diapause period are well understood, the molecular mechanism of diapause remains unknown. Therefore, we collected female adults in three different states, i.e., non-diapause, diapause and diapause termination, for transcriptome sequencing. Results: After transcriptome sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform with pretreatment, a total of 417.6 million clean reads from nine samples were filtered using the program FASTX (version 0.0). Additionally, 106,262 contigs were assembled into 82,820 unigenes with an average length of 921 bp and an N50 of 1,241 bp. All of the unigenes were annotated through BLASTX alignment against the Nr or UniProt database, and 37,872 unigenes were matched. We performed further analysis of these unigenes using the Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins (COG), Gene Ontology (GO), and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases. Through pairwise comparisons of the non-diapause (ND), diapause (D), and diapause-terminated (DT) groups, 3,501 and 1,427 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between D and ND and between DT and D, respectively. Moreover, 443 of the DEGs were specifically expressed during the diapause period (i.e., DEGs that were expressed at the highest or lowest levels during diapause compared with the other stages). GO function and KEGG pathway enrichment were performed on all DEGs and showed that RNA-directed DNA polymerase activity and fatty acid metabolism were significantly affected. Furthermore, eight specific expressed genes were selected for validation using qRT-PCR. Among these eight genes, seven genes were up-regulated, and one gene was down-regulated; the change trends of the eight genes were the same between the qRT-PCR and RNA-seq analysis results. Conclusions: In this study, a new method for collecting and identifying diapause insects was described. We generated a vast quantity of transcriptome data from C. septempunctata L., providing a resource for gene function research. The diapause-associated genes that we identified establish a foundation for future studies on the molecular mechanisms of diapause.																	1471-2164					DEC 21	2015	16								1086	10.1186/s12864-015-2309-3								WOS:000367061700009	26689283

The work we present here analyzes the adaptive synchronization of the diapause process in the wintry generation of A. albopictus, where the egg stage is exposed to adverse winter conditions. The seasonal pattern of egg laying activity of a French Mediterranean population of the Asian tiger mosquito was monitored weekly for 2 years with ovitraps. The field diapause incidence and the critical photoperiod (CPP, i.e. the maternal day length inducing diapause in 50% of the eggs), were determined by hatching experiments on the collected eggs. The period of diapause termination was estimated by a field survey of the first hatchings for both years. The CPP is equal to 13.5 hours of light and occurs in the field on the 25th of August. Thus, it is on September 11th, 17 days after the CPP, that 50% of the eggs are in a prediapause stage in the field. The egg diapause rate increases rapidly during September, whereas the mean number of eggs laid decreases sharply after mid-September. Surprisingly, after having reached a peak of 95% at the end of September, from mid-October the diapause incidence declined and stayed below 50%. Indeed, both years the diapause initiates before the rapid decrease of the environmental temperature. This leaves a sufficient period of time to the complete development of one generation of A. albopictus with effective induction of diapause in the laid eggs. The very first larvae hatched were sampled both years in the first half of March. With 20 to 26 weeks in the egg stage and about 7 weeks in the larval stages, the first annual generation spends a long time in immature stages. On a practical point of view, this long development time represents a wide window for eggs and larvae control in early spring.

The present work investigates the effects of increasing photoperiod, temperature and thermal amplitude on EH duration and GN in durum wheat. Used data related to cv Karim, grown under no limiting water and nutrient conditions in three Tunisian sites: Tunis (16 dates), Kef (8 dates) and Mornag (5 dates). GN varied from 17200 to 800 grains m(-2) when EH range was 117-32 days, for November and July sowings, respectively. For conventional sowing and under higher temperatures wheat reached heading faster with EH interval reduction around 12 days each 1 degrees C rise during the phenophase. The modified photothermal unit (MPTU) gave the best predictive phenological results for both conventional and unconventional sowing dates. Results showed the possible substitution of rise in photoperiod effect by rate of rising in temperature in field conditions. GN was found to be correlated to maximum temperatures adjusted by thermal amplitude logarithm. The latter can express the intensity of thermal stress and can be used as a satisfactory predictor of attainable wheat yields in conditions with no water and nutrient limitation and in Mediterranean environments.																	2038-5625					DEC	2015	20	3					25	34										WOS:000370684400002

However, studies on how winter conditions may affect spring phenology are underrepresented. Previous work on Anthocharis cardamines (orange tip butterfly) has shown population-specific reaction norms of spring development in relation to spring temperature and a speeding up of post-winter development with longer winter durations. In this experiment, we examined the effects of a greater and ecologically relevant range of winter durations on post-winter pupal development of A.cardamines of two populations from the United Kingdom and two from Sweden. By analyzing pupal weight loss and metabolic rate, we were able to separate the overall post-winter pupal development into diapause duration and post-diapause development. We found differences in the duration of cold needed to break diapause among populations, with the southern UK population requiring a shorter duration than the other populations. We also found that the overall post-winter pupal development time, following removal from winter cold, was negatively related to cold duration, through a combined effect of cold duration on diapause duration and on post-diapause development time. Longer cold durations also lead to higher population synchrony in hatching. For current winter durations in the field, the A.cardamines population of southern UK could have a reduced development rate and lower synchrony in emergence because of short winters. With future climate change, this might become an issue also for other populations. Differences in winter conditions in the field among these four populations are large enough to have driven local adaptation of characteristics controlling spring phenology in response to winter duration. The observed phenology of these populations depends on a combination of winter and spring temperatures; thus, both must be taken into account for accurate predictions of phenology.

The reproductive ecology of the invasive Asian paddle crab, Charybdis japonica (Brachyura: Portunidae), in northeastern New Zealand	INVERTEBRATE BIOLOGY												The Asian paddle crab, Charybdis japonica, native to the northwest Pacific, is an invasive species that has established populations within northeastern New Zealand. Here, we provide a detailed examination of C. japonica's reproductive seasonality and gametogenesis, sizes at physiological maturity, and sex ratios outside its native range. Trapping in the Weiti River Estuary, Whangaparoa (36 degrees 38.4'S, 174 degrees 43.6'E) from February 2010 to May 2012 indicated a male-biased population. Reproductive seasonality largely depended on female condition, since males contained ripe spermatozoa year-round. Female gametogenesis began during late autumn, with oocyte development occurring throughout winter to early spring. Based on the presence of mature gametes during late winter and the appearance of gravid females in early November, mating began during early spring, with spawning in mid-spring. Spawning coincided with a large drop in the gonad index, and occurred between sea surface temperatures of 17-22 degrees C and 11.75-13.5 h day length. Females remained reproductive for up to 5 months of the year. Histological observation suggested that CW50 (the carapace width at which 50% of the population is mature) for females was 46.39 mm, while CW50 for males could not be determined due to a paucity of immature males. Histological analysis also suggested that females of C. japonica could produce store sperm and multiple broods annually.

J	Cram, JA				Cram, Jacob A.			New insights into relationships between active and dormant organisms, phylogenetic diversity and ecosystem productivity	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Marine microbes make up a key part of ocean food webs and drive ocean chemistry through a range of metabolic processes. A fundamental question in ecology is whether the diversity of organisms in a community shapes the ecological functions of that community. While there is substantial evidence to support a positive link between diversity and ecological productivity for macro-organisms in terrestrial environments, this relationship has not previously been verified for marine microbial communities. One factor complicating the understanding of this relationship is that many marine microbes are dormant and are easily dispersed by ocean currents, making it difficult to ensure that the organisms found in a given environmental sample accurately reflect processes occurring in that environment. Another complication is that, due to microbes great range of genotypic and phenotypic variability, communities with distantly related species may have greater range of metabolic functions than communities have the same richness and evenness, but in which the species present are more closely related to each other. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Galand etal. (2015) provide compelling evidence that the most metabolically active communities are those in which the nondormant portion of the microbial community has the highest phylogenetic diversity. They also illustrate that focusing on the active portion of the community allows for detection of temporal patterns in community structure that would not be otherwise evident. The authors' point out that the presence of many dormant organisms that do not contribute to ecosystem functioning is a feature that makes microbial ecosystems fundamentally different from macro-ecosystems and that this difference needs to be accounted for in microbial ecology theory.																	0962-1083	1365-294X				DEC	2015	24	23					5767	5769		10.1111/mec.13449								WOS:000365756900001	26607213

Evidence for a substantial host-use bottleneck following the invasion of an exotic, polyphagous weevil	ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												1. The successful establishment of novel plant-insect interactions may depend on the availability of suitable hosts, which itself is influenced by the inherent flexibility of the herbivore for the native plants in its new range. The polyphagous beech leaf mining weevil, Orchestes fagiL., is a recent invader to eastern Canada, and while beech is a primary host, it remains unclear the extent to which it might also utilise co-occurring secondary hosts, as has been observed in its native European range. 2. A combination of field and laboratory feeding trials were used to quantify weevil secondary host use. Based on its expansive native host range in Europe, it was predicted that American beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.), as well as several additional plant species, would be susceptible to weevil damage. 3. Contrary to this prediction, weevil feeding was almost entirely exclusive to beech in both the field and laboratory feeding trials. This result is further supported by field observations that revealed an absence of weevils and eggs on species other than beech. In general, the lack of pre-diapause feeding on any alternate host species represented an extreme departure from feeding habits observed within the native range. 4. Overall, this host-use bottleneck suggests that the adoption of a novel primary host by O. fagi, in this case American beech, may remove the normal requirement for secondary hosts and suggests a significant departure from native feeding habits with possible consequences for related life-history parameters such as overwintering survival and fecundity.																	0307-6946	1365-2311				DEC	2015	40	6					796	804		10.1111/een.12268								WOS:000363797900017

Developmental Biology of Zeugodacus cucurbitae (Diptera: Tephritidae) in Three Cucurbitaceous Hosts at Different Temperature Regimes	JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE												Fruit flies are key pests of cucurbits in many parts of the world, including Tanzania. Developmental biology of Zeugodacus cucurbitae (Coquillett) has been determined across temperature regimes in some cucurbitaceous hosts, in limited geographies. This study was conducted to determine duration and survival rates of immature stages of Z. cucurbitae in three cucurbitaceous hosts, at different temperature regimes. It was hypothesized that temperature and cucurbitaceous hosts influence duration and survival of immature stages of Z. cucurbitae. We conducted experiments in the environmental chamber set at 75 +/- 10% RH and a photoperiod of 12:12 (L:D) h, at temperatures of 20, 25, and 30 degrees. Our results showed that duration and survival of immature stages of Z. cucurbitae differed significantly among the temperature regimes but not among the hosts. Egg incubation period as well as larval and pupal stages were significantly longer (P < 0.0001) at low temperature in all three hosts Likewise, survival rate of all immature stages were significantly higher (P < 0.0001) at higher than lower temperatures. The three hosts, cucumber (Cucumis sativus), watermelon (Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.)

The low developmental thresholds were estimated at 15.88, 13.44, and 12.62 for egg, larva and pupa, respectively. These results further confirm that Z. cucurbitae is well adapted to warm climate, which dominates many areas of Tanzania.																	1536-2442	2250-2645				NOV 20	2015	15								160	10.1093/jisesa/iev141								WOS:000366850700001

Key Edaphic Properties Largely Explain Temporal and Geographic Variation in Soil Microbial Communities across Four Biomes	PLOS ONE												Soil microbial communities play a critical role in nutrient transformation and storage in all ecosystems. Quantifying the seasonal and long-term temporal extent of genetic and functional variation of soil microorganisms in response to biotic and abiotic changes within and across ecosystems will inform our understanding of the effect of climate change on these processes. We examined spatial and seasonal variation in microbial communities based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) composition across four biomes: a tropical broadleaf forest (Hawaii), taiga (Alaska), semiarid grassland-shrubland (Utah), and a subtropical coniferous forest (Florida). In this study, we used a team-based instructional approach leveraging the iPlant Collaborative to examine publicly available National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) 16S gene and PLFA measurements that quantify microbial diversity, composition, and growth. Both profiling techniques revealed that microbial communities grouped strongly by ecosystem and were predominately influenced by three edaphic factors: pH, soil water content, and cation exchange capacity. Temporal variability of microbial communities differed by profiling technique; 16S-based community measurements showed significant temporal variability only in the subtropical coniferous forest communities, specifically through changes within subgroups of Acidobacteria. Conversely, PLFA-based community measurements showed seasonal shifts in taiga and tropical broadleaf forest systems. These differences may be due to the premise that 16S-based measurements are predominantly influenced by large shifts in the abiotic soil environment, while PLFA-based analyses reflect the metabolically active fraction of the microbial community, which is more sensitive to local disturbances and biotic interactions.

Genome sequence of the Asian Tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, reveals insights into its biology, genetics, and evolution	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, is a highly successful invasive species that transmits a number of human viral diseases, including dengue and Chikungunya fevers. This species has a large genome with significant population-based size variation. The complete genome sequence was determined for the Foshan strain, an established laboratory colony derived from wild mosquitoes from southeastern China, a region within the historical range of the origin of the species. The genome comprises 1,967 Mb, the largest mosquito genome sequenced to date, and its size results principally from an abundance of repetitive DNA classes. In addition, expansions of the numbers of members in gene families involved in insecticide-resistance mechanisms, diapause, sex determination, immunity, and olfaction also contribute to the larger size. Portions of integrated flavivirus-like genomes support a shared evolutionary history of association of these viruses with their vector. The large genome repertory may contribute to the adaptability and success of Ae. albopictus as an invasive species.

J	Murray, MH; St Clair, CC				Murray, Maureen H.; St Clair, Colleen Cassady			Individual flexibility in nocturnal activity reduces risk of road mortality for an urban carnivore	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY												Many species living in developed areas adjust the timing of their activity and habitat selection to avoid humans, which may reduce their risk of conflict, including vehicle collisions. Understanding the behavioral adaptations to vehicles exhibited by species that thrive in urban areas could improve the conservation of many species that are threatened by road-caused mortality. We explored these behaviors using the seasonal distribution of 80 road-killed coyotes (Canis latrans) collected by civic employees and by comparing the activity patterns (step lengths) and road crossings made by 19 coyotes fitted with GPS collars with 3-h fix rates, 7 of which were killed in vehicle collisions. Coyotes were collected on roads most often in spring and fall, which corresponded to the most rapid changes in day length in our northern study area and when collared road-killed coyotes were more active during rush hour. Among collared coyotes, those that were killed on roads were most active and crossed roads most frequently at dusk. By contrast, surviving animals were most active and crossed roads most often near midnight year round and surprisingly, exhibited less avoidance of roads than did road-killed coyotes. Our results suggest that risk of vehicle collision is lower for coyotes that restrict the times at which they cross roads but some coyotes do not or cannot. Such behavioral flexibility to adapt to the timing of human activity relative to exogenous cues such as dawn and dusk may contribute to differences both among and within wildlife species in rates of coexistence with humans.

Seasonality and Diapause of Musca autumnalis (Diptera: Muscidae) at its Southern Limits in North America, With Observations on Haematobia irritans (Diptera: Muscidae)	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY												The face fly (Musca autumnalis De Geer) and horn fly (Haematobia irritans ([L.])) were studied at the southern edge of the face fly's North American range, examining southern California geographic distribution, seasonal activity on cattle and in dung, and diapause. Face flies were common only at Pomona (34 degrees 03'N, 117 degrees 48'W). Other irrigated pastures, even those only slightly inland from Pomona, were probably too warm for face flies, due to a steep west (cooler) to east (warmer) temperature gradient. Horn flies were abundant at all sites. Adult densities on cattle, adults emerging from dung pats, and prevalence of fly-positive pats were assessed for both fly species throughout a year at Pomona. Summer adult horn fly densities of 500-2,000 flies per cow, or face fly densities of 3-10 flies per face, were common. Summer prevalence of face fly-positive pats and horn fly-positive pats was about 20-40% and 30-70%, respectively. Face fly adults diapaused from late October until late March and early April. Horn flies probably diapaused as pupae from late October or early November to early-mid March, although some emerged in winter. Experimental cohorts of October-emerging adult face flies were held in a representative overwintering site. They exhibited hypertrophied fat body and undeveloped oocytes, which are characteristics of diapause, and survived until the following spring. The dominant diapause cues in face and horn flies are probably photoperiod and temperature. Despite warm winter temperatures that would permit activity of both species, and despite relatively long winter day lengths, face flies and most horn flies still diapaused at this latitude.																	0022-2585	1938-2928				NOV	2015	52	6					1213	1224		10.1093/jme/tjv123								WOS:000365199000004	26336262

Eukaryotic clocks consist of core transcription-translation feedback loops that generate a cycle and post-translational modifiers that maintain that cycle at about 24 h. We use the pitcher-plant mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii (subfamily Culicini, tribe Sabethini), to test whether evolutionary divergence of the circadian clock genes in this species, relative to other insects, has involved primarily genes in the core feedback loops or the post-translational modifiers. Heretofore, there is no reference transcriptome or genome sequence for any mosquito in the tribe Sabethini, which includes over 375 mainly circumtropical species. Methods: We sequenced, assembled and annotated the transcriptome of W. smithii containing nearly 95 % of conserved single-copy orthologs in animal genomes. We used the translated contigs and singletons to determine the average rates of circadian clock-gene divergence in W. smithii relative to three other mosquito genera, to Drosophila, to the butterfly, Danaus, and to the wasp, Nasonia. Results: Over 1.08 million cDNA sequence reads were obtained consisting of 432.5 million nucleotides. Their assembly produced 25,904 contigs and 54,418 singletons of which 62 % and 28 % are annotated as protein-coding genes, respectively, sharing homology with other animal proteomes. Discussion: The W. smithii transcriptome includes all nine circadian transcription-translation feedback-loop genes and all eight post-translational modifier genes we sought to identify (Fig. 1). After aligning translated W. smithii contigs and singletons from this transcriptome with other insects, we determined that there was no significant difference in the average divergence of W. smithii from the six other taxa between the core feedback-loop genes and post-translational modifiers. Conclusions: The characterized transcriptome is sufficiently complete and of sufficient quality to have uncovered all of the insect circadian clock genes we sought to identify (Fig. 1). Relative divergence does not differ between core feedback-loop genes and post-translational modifiers of those genes in a Sabethine species (W. smithii) that has experienced a continual northward dispersal into temperate regions of progressively longer summer day lengths as compared with six other insect taxa. An associated microarray platform derived from this work will enable the investigation of functional genomics of circadian rhythmicity, photoperiodic time measurement, and diapause along a photic and seasonal geographic gradient.

LIFE HISTORY, BURROWING BEHAVIOR, AND DISTRIBUTION OF NEOHERMES FILICORNIS (MEGALOPTERA: CORYDALIDAE), A LONG-LIVED AQUATIC INSECT IN INTERMITTENT STREAMS	WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST												Several species of fishflies (Megaloptera: Corydalidae: Chauliodinae) have been reported from intermittent streams in western North America, but the life histories and distributions of these species are poorly understood. We studied the life history of Neohermes filicornis (Banks 1903) for 2 years in Donner Creek (Contra Costa County, California), a small intermittent stream that flows for 5-7 months per year. Neohermes filicornis had a 3-4-year life span and larval growth was asynchronous. Analysis of gut contents showed that larvae were generalist predators of aquatic insect larvae including Diptera, Ephemeroptera, and Plecoptera. Final instars dug pupal chambers in the streambed and began pupation within several days of stream drying. Dry conditions in 2007 resulted in stream drying 50 days earlier than in 2006, which was reflected in earlier pupation and adult emergence in 2007 than in 2006. Pupal and adult stages each lasted for 1-2 weeks. Although active burrowing into the dry streambed was not observed in the field, N. filicornis larvae initiated burrowing in response to simulated stream drying in laboratory experiments, while Orohermes crepusculus (Chauliodinae), a fishfly species common in perennial streams, did not exhibit burrowing behavior. We present new and historic collection records for Neohermes spp. in western North America. Neohermes filicornis is distributed in California, Arizona, western New Mexico, Baja California, and Sonora. A sister taxon, Neohermes californicus, has been collected in California, Oregon, and Idaho. In California, N. filicornis is primarily distributed in the Coast Range and mountains of Southern California, whereas N. californicus occurs in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, with possible range overlap at the northern and southern ends of the Central Valley. As a long-lived aquatic insect, N. filicornis exhibits considerable plasticity in the phenology of its life cycle and undergoes multiple episodes of larval dormancy in intermittent streams of western North America.																	1527-0904	1944-8341				OCT	2015	75	4					474	490		10.3398/064.075.0405								WOS:000370893100007

X.; Schmid, Markus; Schwechheimer, Claus			Modulation of Ambient Temperature-Dependent Flowering in Arabidopsis thaliana by Natural Variation of FLOWERING LOCUS M	PLOS GENETICS												Plants integrate seasonal cues such as temperature and day length to optimally adjust their flowering time to the environment. Compared to the control of flowering before and after winter by the vernalization and day length pathways, mechanisms that delay or promote flowering during a transient cool or warm period, especially during spring, are less well understood. Due to global warming, understanding this ambient temperature pathway has gained increasing importance. In Arabidopsis thaliana, FLOWERING LOCUS M (FLM) is a critical flowering regulator of the ambient temperature pathway. FLM is alternatively spliced in a temperature-dependent manner and the two predominant splice variants, FLM-beta and FLM-delta, can repress and activate flowering in the genetic background of the A. thaliana reference accession Columbia-0. The relevance of this regulatory mechanism for the environmental adaptation across the entire range of the species is, however, unknown. Here, we identify insertion polymorphisms in the first intron of FLM as causative for accelerated flowering in many natural A. thaliana accessions, especially in cool (15 degrees C) temperatures. We present evidence for a potential adaptive role of this structural variation and link it specifically to changes in the abundance of FLM-beta. Our results may allow predicting flowering in response to ambient temperatures in the Brassicaceae.

Organophosphate Insecticide Activity Reduced when Mixed with Copper(II) Hydroxide in Peach Dormant Sprays	JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGICAL SCIENCE												Dormant-season applications of copper-containing fungicides and organophosphate insecticides are common in Prunus spp. orchards, and these compounds are often mixed into a single application. However, copper(II) catalyzes the hydrolytic breakdown of many organophosphate insecticides. We measured the impact of tank-mixing these products using field efficacy data collected from 2002 to 2004 coupled with active ingredient degradation studies in the laboratory. Formulations of the organophosphate insecticides chlorpyrifos and diazinon were applied with and without the fungicide Cu(OH)(2) in peach orchards, and the resulting peach twig borer (Anarsia lineatella Zeller) damage was measured. Laboratory experiments to quantify the degradation of the active organophosphate ingredient in various dry deposits from treatment solutions showed that addition of Cu(OH)(2) to laboratory organophosphate solutions resulted in more rapid degradation of the active organophosphate ingredient in dry deposits stored at 100% relative humidity at room temperature. Unsurprisingly, there was significantly more peach twig borer field damage in chlorpyrifos treatments containing copper than those that excluded copper. However, this was not observed with diazinon. Because copper(II) catalyzes the breakdown of various organophosphate insecticides across a range of pH values, caution should be used with the simultaneous application of copper(II)-containing fungicides/bactericides and organophosphate insecticides.																	0749-8004					OCT	2015	50	4					284	294										WOS:000364107400002

Valid auto-models for spatially autocorrelated occupancy and abundance data	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Spatially autocorrelated species abundance or distribution data sets typically generate spatially autocorrelated residuals in generalized linear models; a broader modelling framework is therefore required. Auto-logistic and related auto-models, implemented approximately as autocovariate regression, provide simple and direct modelling of spatial population processes. The auto-logistic model has been widely applied in ecology since Augustin, Mugglestone and Buckland (Journal of Applied Ecology, 1996, 33, 339) analysed red deer census data using a hybrid estimation approach, combining maximum pseudo-likelihood estimation with Gibbs sampling of missing data. However, Dormann (Ecological Modelling, 2007, 207, 234) questioned the validity of auto-logistic regression even for fully observed data, giving examples of apparent underestimation of covariate parameters in analysis of simulated snouter' data. Dormann etal. (Ecography, 2007, 30, 609) extended this critique to auto-Poisson and certain auto-normal models, finding again that autocovariate-regression estimates for covariate parameters bore little resemblance to values employed to generate snouter' data. We note that all the above studies employ neighbourhood weighting schemes inconsistent with auto-model definitions; in the auto-Poisson case, a further inconsistency was the failure to exclude cooperative interactions. We investigate the impact of these implementation errors on auto-model estimation using both empirical and simulated data sets. We show that when snouter' data are reanalysed using valid weightings, very different estimates are obtained for covariate parameters. For auto-logistic and auto-normal models, the new estimates agree closely with values used to generate the snouter' simulations. Re-analysis of the red deer data shows that invalid neighbourhood weightings generate only small estimation errors for the full data set, but larger errors occur on geographic subsamples. A substantial fraction of papers employing auto-logistic regression use these invalid neighbourhood weightings, which were embedded as default options in the widely used spdep' spatial dependence package for R. Auto-logistic analyses conducted using invalid neighbourhood weightings will be erroneous to an extent that can vary widely. These analyses can easily be corrected by using valid neighbourhood weightings available in spdep'. The hybrid estimation approach for missing data is readily adapted for valid neighbourhood weighting schemes and is implemented here in R for application to sparse presence-absence data.

Conservation Physiology and Conservation Pathogens: White-Nose Syndrome and Integrative Biology for Host-Pathogen Systems	INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY												Synopsis Conservation physiology aims to apply an understanding of physiological mechanisms to management of imperiled species, populations, or ecosystems. One challenge for physiologists hoping to apply their expertise to conservation is connecting the mechanisms we study, often in the laboratory, with the vital rates of populations in the wild. There is growing appreciation that infectious pathogens can threaten populations and species, and represent an important issue for conservation. Conservation physiology has much to offer in terms of addressing the threat posed to some host species by infectious pathogens. At the same time, the well-developed theoretical framework of disease ecology could provide a model to help advance the application of physiology to a range of other conservation issues. Here, I use white-nose syndrome (WNS) in hibernating North American bats as an example of a conservation problem for which integrative physiological research has been a critical part of research and management. The response to WNS highlights the importance of a well-developed theoretical framework for the application of conservation physiology to a particular threat. I review what is known about physiological mechanisms associated with mortality from WNS and emphasize the value of combining a strong theoretical background with integrative physiological studies in order to connect physiological mechanisms with population processes and thereby maximize the potential benefits of conservation physiology.																	1540-7063	1557-7023				OCT	2015	55	4					631	641		10.1093/icb/icv099								WOS:000362672100007	26307096					
J	Wallsten, B; Magnusson, D; Andersson, S; Krook, J				Wallsten, Bjorn; Magnusson, Dick; Andersson, Simon; Krook, Joakim			The economic conditions for urban infrastructure mining: Using GIS to prospect hibernating copper stocks	RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING												In this article, we suggest a methodology that combines geographic information systems (GIS) and material flow analysis (MFA) into a secondary reserve-prospecting tool. The approach is two-phased and couples spatially informed size estimates of urban metal stocks (phase 1) to the equally spatially contingent efforts required to extract them (phase 2). Too often, even the most advanced MFA assessments stop at the first of these two phases, meaning that essential information needed to facilitate resource recovery, i.e., urban mining, is missing from their results. To take MFA one step further, our approach is characterized by a high resolution that connects the analysis of the stock to the social practices that arrange material flows in the city, thereby enabling an assessment of the economic conditions for secondary resource recovery. To exemplify, we provide a case study of the hibernation stock of copper found in disconnected power cables in Linkoping, Sweden. Since 1970, 123 tonnes of copper or approximate to 1 kg per person have accumulated underneath the city, predominantly in old, central parts of the city and industrial areas. While shorter cables are more numerous than long ones, the longer ones contribute to a larger share of the stock weight. Resource recovery in specific projects reliant on digging comes at great costs, but integrating it as an added value to ordinary maintenance operations render eight locations and 2.2 tonnes of copper (2% of the stock) profitable to extract. Compared to the budget sizes of regular maintenance projects, the integrated recovery of a significant share of the stock comes with relatively small economic losses. Therefore, we suggest integrated resource recovery and regular maintenance as an interesting environmental measure for any infrastructure provider to engage with. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, the genetic basis underlying flowering time is yet to be elucidated in most cereals. Although staple cereals, such as rice, maize, wheat, barley, and sorghum, have spread and adapted to a wide range of ecological environments during domestication, it is yet to be determined whether they have a common genetic basis for flowering time. In this study, we show, through map-based cloning, that flowering time in sorghum is controlled by a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) Heading Date 1 (HD1), located on chromosome 10. The causal gene encodes the CONSTANS gene family which contains a CCT domain. A 5-bp deletion of a minor allele present in the coding sequence leads to a gene frameshift that delays flowering in sorghum. In contrast, in foxtail millet, association mapping of HD1 showed a common causal site with a splicing variant from "GT" to "AT" that was highly correlated with flowering time. In addition, the rice HD1 gene is known to harbor several causal variants controlling flowering time. These data indicate that the major flowering time QTL HD1 was under parallel domestication in sorghum, foxtail millet, and rice. The pattern of common mixed minor, or even rare, causal alleles in HD1 across different species may be representative of the genetic basis of the domestication syndrome. Furthermore, large DNA sequence analysis of HD1 revealed multiple origins for domesticated sorghum and a single origin for domesticated foxtail millet.																	0737-4038	1537-1719				OCT	2015	32	10					2726	2737		10.1093/molbev/msv148								WOS:000361987100020	26116860

The success of assisted colonization and assisted gene flow depends on phenology	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Global warming will jeopardize the persistence and genetic diversity of many species. Assisted colonization, or the movement of species beyond their current range boundary, is a conservation strategy proposed for species with limited dispersal abilities or adaptive potential. However, species that rely on photoperiodic and thermal cues for development may experience conflicting signals if transported across latitudes. Relocating multiple, distinct populations may remedy this quandary by expanding genetic variation and promoting evolutionary responses in the receiving habitat - a strategy known as assisted gene flow. To better inform these policies, we planted seeds from latitudinally distinct populations of the annual legume, Chamaecrista fasciculata, in a potential future colonization site north of its current range boundary. Plants were exposed to ambient or elevated temperatures via infrared heating. We monitored several life history traits and estimated patterns of natural selection to determine the adaptive value of plastic responses. To assess the feasibility of assisted gene flow between phenologically distinct populations, we counted flowers each day and estimated the degree of temporal isolation between populations. Increased temperatures advanced each successive phenological trait more than the last, resulting in a compressed life cycle for all but the southern-most population. Warming altered patterns of selection on flowering onset and vegetative biomass. Population performance was dependent on latitude of origin, with the northern-most population performing best under ambient conditions and the southern-most performing most poorly, even under elevated temperatures. Among-population differences in flowering phenology limited the potential for genetic exchange among the northern- and southern-most populations. All plastic responses to warming were neutral or adaptive; however, photoperiodic constraints will likely necessitate evolutionary responses for long-term persistence, especially when involving populations from disparate latitudes. With strategic planning, our results suggest that assisted colonization and assisted gene flow may be feasible options for preservation.

J	Reis, M; Valer, FB; Vieira, CP; Vieira, J				Reis, Micael; Valer, Felipe B.; Vieira, Cristina P.; Vieira, Jorge			Drosophila americana Diapausing Females Show Features Typical of Young Flies	PLOS ONE												Diapause is a period of arrested development which is controlled physiologically, preprogrammed environmentally and characterized by metabolic depression that can occur during any stage of insect development. Nevertheless, in the genus Drosophila, diapause is almost always associated with the cessation of ovarian development and reproductive activity in adult females. In this work, we show that, in D. americana (a temperate species of the virilis group), diapause is a genetically determined delay in ovarian development that is triggered by temperature and/or photoperiod. Moreover, we show that in this species diapause incidence increases with latitude, ranging from 13% in the southernmost to 91% in the northernmost range of the distribution. When exposed to diapause inducing conditions, both diapausing and non-diapausing females show a 10% increase in lifespan, that is further increased by 18.6% in diapausing females, although senescence is far from being negligible. ActinD1 expression levels suggest that diapausing females are biologically much younger than their chronological age, and that the fly as a whole, rather than the ovarian development alone, which is phenotypically more evident, is delayed by diapause. Therefore, diapause candidate genes that show expression levels that are compatible with flies younger than their chronological age may not necessarily play a role in reproductive diapause and in adaptation to seasonally varying environmental conditions.

Dormant phages of Helicobacter pylori reveal distinct populations in Europe	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Prophages of Helicobacter pylori, a bacterium known to co-evolve in the stomach of its human host, were recently identified. However, their role in the diversity of H. pylori strains is unknown. We demonstrate here and for the first time that the diversity of the prophage genes offers the ability to distinguish between European populations, and that H. pylori prophages and their host bacteria share a complex evolutionary history. By comparing the phylogenetic trees of two prophage genes (integrase and holin) and the multilocus sequence typing (MLST)-based data obtained for seven housekeeping genes, we observed that the majority of the strains belong to the same phylogeographic group in both trees. Furthermore, we found that the Bayesian analysis of the population structure of the prophage genes identified two H. pylori European populations, hpNEurope and hpSWEurope, while the MLST sequences identified one European population, hpEurope. The population structure analysis of H. pylori prophages was even more discriminative than the traditional MLST-based method for the European population. Prophages are new players to be considered not only to show the diversity of H. pylori strains but also to more sharply define human populations.

The melatonin (MLT) hypothesis suggests that exposure to ELFMF might decrease MLT production thereby promoting cancerogenesis. So far, most studies of MLT secretion under exposure to ELFMF reported negative or inconsistent results. Here, we measured salivary MLT in 1-2 months old cattle calves exposed to 50 Hz-MF in the hundreds of nT-range. We found an inhibitory effect of the ELFMF upon MLT secretion in winter (in accordance with the MLT hypothesis). In contrast, in summer, MLT concentration was increased by ELFMF exposure (contrary to the MLT hypothesis). The inhibitory effect in winter was much stronger than the positive effect in summer. We hypothesize that this season-dependent effect upon MLT synthesis might by mediated by an effect of ELFMF upon the serotonin metabolism and conclude that future tests of ELFMF effects should also measure serotonin levels and consider association with the seasonal effects (photoperiod or temperature) during the exposure.

However, compared to the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), less attention has been paid to the raccoon dog as a potentially important host for Echinococcus multilocularis, the infective agent of alveolar echinococcosis, which is an emerging infectious disease with a high mortality rate. We examined the small intestines of 249 Estonian raccoon dogs and found 1.6% of individuals to be infected with E. multilocularis. The relatively large difference between this prevalence and that found in sympatric red foxes (31.5%) sampled during the same time period might be due to differences in diet: red foxes consume significantly more arvicolid rodents - the main intermediate hosts of the parasite - especially during the coldest period of the year when raccoon dogs hibernate. Nonetheless, given the relatively high density of raccoon dogs, our results suggest that the species also represents an important definitive host species for E. multilocularis in Estonia. Compared with other countries in Europe where E. multilocularis-infected raccoon dogs have been recorded (Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Germany, and Slovakia), the prevalence in Estonia is low. The longer hibernation period of raccoon dogs at higher latitudes may explain this pattern. Both mitochondrial and nuclear loci were analysed for Estonian isolates: based on EmsB microsatellite genotyping the Estonian isolates shared an identical genotype with E. multilocularis in northern Poland, suggesting a common history with this region. The data from more than a quarter of the mitochondrial genome (3558 bp) revealed two novel haplotypes specific to Estonia and placed them into the same haplogroup with isolates from other European regions. Considering that the raccoon dog is becoming increasingly widespread and is already relatively abundant in several countries in Europe, the role of the species must be taken into account when assessing the E. multilocularis related risks to public health.

FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY												Introduction: It has been suggested that rapid range expansion could proceed through evolution in the endocrinological machinery controlling life-history switches. Based on this we tested whether the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, which has rapidly expanded its range across latitudinal regions in Europe, and shows photoperiodic adaptation in overwintering initiation, has different sensitivities to juvenile hormone (JH) manipulation along a latitudinal gradient. Results: A factorial experiment where beetles were reared either under a long or short day photoperiod was performed. Hormone levels were manipulated by topical applications. An allatostatin mimic, H17, was used to decrease and a juvenile hormone III analogue, pyriproxyfen, was used to increase the hormone levels. The effects of photoperiod and hormone manipulations on fecundity and overwintering related burrowing were monitored. Application of H17 decreased fecundity but did not induce overwintering related burrowing. Manipulation with pyriproxyfen increased fecundity and delayed burrowing. While small population-dependent differences in responsiveness to the topical application treatments were observed in fecundity, none were seen in overwintering related burrowing. Conclusions: The results indicate that the rapid photoperiodic adaptation manifested in several life-history and physiological traits in L. decemlineata in Europe is unlikely a result of population dependent differences in JH III sensitivity. While other endocrine factors cannot be ruled out, more likely mechanisms could be genetic changes in upstream elements, such as the photoperiodic clock or the insulin signaling pathway.

RNA-Seq analysis and whole genome DNA-binding profile of the Vibrio cholerae histone-like nucleoid structuring protein (H-NS)	GENOMICS DATA												The data described in this article pertain to the genome-wide transcription profiling of a Vibrio cholerae mutant lacking the histone-like nucleoid structuring protein (H-NS) and the mapping of the H-NS chromosome binding sites (Wang et al., 2015 [1]; Ayala et al., 2015 [2]). H-NS is a nucleoid-associated protein with two interrelated functions: organization of the bacterial nucleoid and transcriptional silencing (Dorman, 2013 [3]). Both functions require DNA binding and protein oligomerization (Spurio et al., 1997[4]; Dame et al., 2001 [5]). H-NS commonly silences the expression of virulence factors acquired by lateral gene transfer (Navarre et al., 2006 [6]). The highly pleiotropic nature of hns mutants in V. cholerae indicates that H-NS impacts a broad range of cellular processes such as virulence, stress response, surface attachment, biofilm development, motility and chemotaxis. We used a V. cholerae strain harboring a deletion of hns and a strain expressing H-NS tagged at the C-terminus with the FLAG epitope to generate datasets representing the hns transcriptome and DNA binding profile under laboratory conditions (LBmedium, 37 degrees C). The datasets are publicly available at the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) with accession numbers GSE62785 and GSE64249. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Limited impact of irrigation on the phenology of Brachychiton megaphyllus: a deciduous shrub that flowers while leafless during the tropical dry season	JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY												A suite of woody plants inhabiting the seasonally dry tropics flower while leafless during the dry season, raising intriguing questions about the role of moisture limitation in shaping their phenology. Brachychiton megaphyllus is one such species, a shrub of open forests and savannas in northern Australia. We documented leaf and reproductive phenology of 14 shrubs, and irrigated a further 15, to determine if soil moisture affected leafiness and reproductive activity. Brachychiton megaphyllus showed first flower buds shortly after the cessation of wet-season rains, and budded and flowered throughout the dry season. In some plants, leaf flush occurred prior to the first rains. Rates of fruit set and maturity were very low. Irrigation did not significantly influence leaf shoot or subsequent canopy development. Contrary to expectation, irrigation decreased the production of buds and flowers though it had no impact on the production of fruit, a response for which we suggest a number of hypotheses. Phenological responses to irrigation may have been limited because B. megaphyllus responds primarily to cues other than soil moisture and is buffered against seasonal drought by a large tap root. This suggests mechanisms by which flowering while leafless may occur in a range of species.

Seasonal variation in life history traits in two Drosophila species	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY												Seasonal environmental heterogeneity is cyclic, persistent and geographically widespread. In species that reproduce multiple times annually, environmental changes across seasonal time may create different selection regimes that may shape the population ecology and life history adaptation in these species. Here, we investigate how two closely related species of Drosophila in a temperate orchard respond to environmental changes across seasonal time. Natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans were sampled at four timepoints from June through November to assess seasonal change in fundamental aspects of population dynamics as well as life history traits. D. melanogaster exhibit pronounced change across seasonal time: early in the season, the population is inferred to be uniformly young and potentially represents the early generation following overwintering survivorship. D. melanogaster isofemale lines derived from the early population and reared in a common garden are characterized by high tolerance to a variety of stressors as well as a fast rate of development in the laboratory environment that declines across seasonal time. In contrast, wild D. simulans populations were inferred to be consistently heterogeneous in age distribution across seasonal collections; only starvation tolerance changed predictably over seasonal time in a parallel manner as in D. melanogaster. These results suggest fundamental differences in population and evolutionary dynamics between these two taxa associated with seasonal heterogeneity in environmental parameters and associated selection pressures.																	1010-061X	1420-9101				SEP	2015	28	9					1691	1704		10.1111/jeb.12690								WOS:000362591200010	26174167

In this study, the effects of different scarification methods and temperature regimes on seed germination performance of the invasive exotic tree Robinia pseudoacacia L. were investigated. Ripe seeds were gathered from six collection sites in Tuscany (central Italy). Mechanical, chemical and thermal scarifications and no pretreatment were applied; seeds were incubated in a range (9-21A degrees C) of constant temperature regimes. The scarification treatments proved highly important for the germination performance of seeds in term of both final response and germination rate in time, with mechanical scarification being the most effective treatment. Temperature significantly affected the germination rate and the mean germination time of the mechanically scarified seeds. The cumulative germination rate significantly decreased with the reduction of the temperature, with the highest value in the 18-21A degrees C regimes (ca 98%), and the lowest in the 9-12A degrees C regimes (ca 60%). The mean germination time slightly decreased with increasing temperature, but was substantially similar between 18A degrees C and 21A degrees C. Our data indicate that the temperature affected the onset of seed germination and that the lowest temperature tested delayed germination. These plastic germination responses, as well as the high germination capacity at lower temperature, may result in the spread of the propagule germination over a large time interval, contributing to the invasiveness of this species.

Movement Patterns of Prairie Rattlesnakes (Crotalus v. viridis) across a Mountainous Landscape in a Designated Wilderness Area	JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY												Many snake species make lengthy linear migrations between overwintering sites and summer foraging or mating habitats. Although mountainous topography may restrict migratory movements, most previous studies on migratory snake populations have occurred in areas with low to moderate topographic relief. The objectives of this study were to describe the movement patterns of Prairie Rattlesnakes (Crotalus v. viridis) in a mountainous landscape, compare those patterns to those of migratory snake populations from areas with lower topographic relief, and test for variation in movement patterns between sexes and among years. We used radiotelemetry to monitor the movements of 21 male and 6 nonpregnant female Prairie Rattlesnakes in the Frank Church Wilderness in central Idaho during the summers of 2006-2008. Mean total distance moved during the entire activity season in 2008 was 4.46 km (range 1.38-7.67); mean maximum distance moved from the hibernaculum was 1.46 km (range 0.69-2.71). Although the movement distances reported here are intermediate to those reported for other migratory snake populations, they are similar to some distances reported from areas with low to moderate topographic relief. This suggests that rattlesnakes are capable of making considerable movements in a mountainous landscape, although factors such as prey availability could also contribute to differences in reported movement distances. Rattlesnakes displayed moderate fidelity to summer activity areas but had similar mean bearings during outbound migration across multiple years. We hypothesize that linear migrations reported from rattlesnakes in many populations actually represent the most-direct movement to annual foraging areas rather than true searching movements.																	0022-1511	1937-2418				SEP	2015	49	3					377	387		10.1670/13-153								WOS:000361840800007

The consequences of photoperiodism for organisms in new climates	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												A change in climate is known to affect seasonal timing (phenology) of the life stages of poikilothermic organisms whose development depends on temperature. Less understood is the potential for even greater disruption to the life cycle when a phenology shift exposes photoperiod-sensitive life stages to new day lengths. We present a conceptual framework and model to investigate the ways that photoperiod-cued diapause can interact with a change in climate or latitude to influence voltinism in poikilothermic organisms. Our degree-day phenology model combines detailed spatial climate data, latitude-and date-specific photoperiods, and development and photoperiod response parameters. As an example, we model the biological control beetle Galerucella calmariensis and map the number of generations expected following its introduction into diverse climates throughout the continental United States. Incorporation of photoperiodism results in a complex geography of voltinism that differs markedly from predictions of traditional phenology models. Facultative multivoltine species will be prone to univoltism when transported to either warmer or southern climates due to exposure of the sensitive stage to shorter day lengths. When moved to more northern locations, they may attempt too many generations for the season duration thereby exposing vulnerable life stages to harsh weather in the fall. We further show that even small changes in temperature can result in large and unexpected shifts in voltinism. Analogous effects may be expected for organisms from wide variety of taxa that use photoperiod as a seasonal cue during some stage of their life cycle. Our approach is useful for understanding the performance and impacts of introduced pests and beneficial organisms as well as for predicting responses of resident species to climate change and climate variability.																	1051-0761	1939-5582				SEP	2015	25	6					1506	1517		10.1890/14-2071.1								WOS:000360813100006	26552260

Bluff & Fingerh. (Common Twayblade; Listera ovata (L.) R. Br.) that are relevant to an understanding of its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, reproductive characteristics, herbivores, history and conservation.Neottia ovata is one of the commonest orchids in the British Isles. It occupies a wide range of habitats from lowlands to mountains and from wet to dry sites: deciduous broadleaved and mixed woodland, forest edges, calcareous grassland and scrub, hedgerows, dry meadows, pastures, sand dunes, fens, floodplains and some anthropogenic sites.Neottia ovata is a perennial herb whose populations are maintained predominantly by sexual reproduction, as vegetative spread is limited. The main perennating organ is a horizontal rhizome that produces a new internode every year. The numerous adventitious roots are mainly colonized by Basidiomycota from Sebacinales (Clade B) but also by several other fungal groups. Dormancy, that is the failure of above-ground parts to appear in a growing season, followed by reappearance of full-sized photosynthetic plants in subsequent seasons, has been occasionally observed and typically lasts for one, or sometimes 2years. The species flowers from early May to the beginning of July, or August at higher altitudes. The flowers of the genus Neottia possess a sensitive rostellum that releases a viscid fluid when it is touched, gluing the pollinia to the pollinator. N.ovata is pollinated mainly by three insect groups: ichneumonids, sawflies and beetles. The mean fraction of flowers setting fruit is c.40%, but it depends on weather conditions: in rainy weather, it decreases to 10%, and in warm, dry weather, it can increase to 100%. Spontaneous autogamy is rare (1% of flowers).Neottia ovata is classified as a species of Least Concern in Great Britain. Although it appears well adapted to countryside changes, thanks to its wide habitat range, the species has vanished from almost 30% of its historical sites in Britain and Ireland. Agricultural activities are mainly responsible for losses of N.ovata sites in the lowlands.																	0022-0477	1365-2745				SEP	2015	103	5					1354	1366		10.1111/1365-2745.12444								WOS:000360216400026

Allelic variants in the PRR37 gene and the human-mediated dispersal and diversification of sorghum	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS												Allele phylogenetic analysis of the sorghum flowering-time gene PRR37 provided new insight into the human-mediated selection of a key adaptive gene that occurred during sorghum's diversification and worldwide dispersal. The domestication and spread of the tropical cereal sorghum is associated with the historic movement of humans. We show that an allelic series at PRR37 (pseudo-response regulator 37), a circadian clock-associated transcription factor, was selected in long-day ecosystems worldwide to permit floral initiation and grain production. We identified a series of loss-of-function (photoperiod-insensitive) alleles encoding truncated PRR37 proteins, alleles with key amino acid substitutions in the pseudo-receiver domain, and a novel splice variant in which the pseudo-receiver domain is truncated. Each PRR37 allelic variant was traced to a specific geographic location or specialized agronomic type. We present a graphical model that shows evidence of human selection and gene flow of the PRR37 allelic variants during the global dispersal and agronomic diversification of sorghum. With the recent identification of the Ghd7 gene as an important regulator of flowering date in sorghum, we briefly examine whether loss-of-function Ghd7 allelic variants were selected prior to the human-mediated movement of sorghum from its equatorial center of origin to temperate climates worldwide.																	0040-5752	1432-2242				SEP	2015	128	9					1669	1683		10.1007/s00122-015-2523-z								WOS:000359835800002	25982128

Reproductive biology and energy allocation of the sea star Cosmasterias lurida (Echinodermata: Asteroidea) from the Beagle Channel, Tierra del Fuego, Argentina	POLAR BIOLOGY												Seasonal fluctuations in environmental factors at high-latitude marine regions have a strong influence on the reproductive cycles of echinoderms. The purposes of this study on a population of Cosmasterias lurida in the Beagle Channel are to describe the reproductive cycle through histological analyses, to characterize the pattern of gonad and somatic indices, to determine the energy content of different organs and their temporal variation and to establish the pattern of energy allocation. During the study period, from August 2010 to June 2011, four seasonal samplings were performed in the subtidal zone of Ushuaia Bay. Indices (gonad, pyloric caeca and stomach), gonadal histology, organic matter and calorimetric measurements were determined. Gametogenesis begins in February and continues until June when oocyte size increases. The gonadal maximum development and gamete releasing take place between August and December. Temporal variation of energetic reserves in gonads occurs through the variation in gonad mass, with a GI major peak and energy content during August. Stomach and pyloric caeca show their maximum energy accumulation during June, while decrease of organic matter of the body wall takes place from August to December. The population of C. lurida from Beagle Channel suggests an annual reproductive cycle with two maturation events and the influence of water temperature on maturation and releasing of gametes. Different patterns of energy allocation to gonads between sexes were observed, with a greater energy investment in females than in males. Pyloric caeca, stomach and body wall were proposed as energy reservoirs for gonadal maturation and spawning.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				SEP	2015	38	9					1321	1333		10.1007/s00300-015-1696-x								WOS:000359188800001						
J	Nilsson, C; Backman, J; Karlsson, H; Alerstam, T				Nilsson, Cecilia; Backman, Johan; Karlsson, Hakan; Alerstam, Thomas			Timing of nocturnal passerine migration in Arctic light conditions	POLAR BIOLOGY												The nocturnal migration of many passerines starts after sunset and reaches peak intensity during the dark hours of the night. Birds destined for high Arctic breeding grounds encounter a special situation, as they will experience continuous daylight when reaching the high latitudes during the final part of spring migration. How does this affect the pattern of nocturnal migration? We consider three alternative hypotheses; that the period of nocturnal flight activity may become compressed, remain unchanged or become disorganized under Arctic light conditions. We tracked migrating birds by radar north of the Arctic Circle (at Abisko, 68A degrees 21'N, 18A degrees 49'E, in Swedish Lapland) and show that the pattern during the night, with a migration peak around midnight, persisted even in continuous daylight when the sun remained above the horizon throughout the 24 h of the day. The flight intensity peak under continuous daylight in spring (midnight sun) was very similar to the corresponding peak in autumn, when the migration took place under twilight conditions. The duration of the flight period under continuous daylight in spring lasted 8-10 h and did not seem to be compressed. We hypothesize that the flight period under midnight sun conditions may in fact be more protracted than during short nights, because of release from twilight cues that tend to synchronize initiation and termination of migratory flights. These cues will thus capture and confine the flight period. The results of this provisional study suggest interesting dynamics in timing of nocturnal migratory flights under seasonally and latitudinally changing day length conditions, which will need detailed documentation by future studies of migration intensity at high-latitude sites.

Spring phenology and the response to global warming in gall-inducing sawflies	POLAR BIOLOGY												The phenological window of opportunity for mating, oviposition and larval development is an important part in the life cycle of gall-inducing sawflies. Spring temperatures play an essential role in the timing of eclosion and host plant leaf flush, which are evolutionarily synchronized. This study investigates important events in spring phenology and timing of eclosion for three sympatric gall-inducing sawfly species (Symphyta: Tenthredinidae: Pontania nivalis, P. glabrifrons and P. arcticornis) at two sites in northern Norway. The rate of development was established by monitoring the time to eclosion at constant temperatures of 9, 15, 23 and 28 A degrees C. There was no significant difference in the lower developmental threshold (2.36 A degrees C) and hour-degree requirement for eclosion (6909 hour-degrees) for the three Pontania species. These two values were used with field and historical temperature data to estimating eclosion over 21 years (1993-2013). The results showed later eclosion dates at the arctic than at subarctic site (mean difference 16 days, range 2-30). There was a highly significant advance of eclosion from 1993 to 2013 in both sites, an evidence of global warming. Adult presence in the subarctic site (field trapping, 2012 and 2013) supported the simulated model used. Measurements of gall size showed continuous gall growth until late August, well ahead of winter hibernation. To conclude, gall-inducing sawflies show large phenological plasticity in timing of eclosion, largely regulated by spring temperature, indicating that they are highly adapted to unpredictable subarctic and arctic climates.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				SEP	2015	38	9					1503	1513		10.1007/s00300-015-1712-1								WOS:000359188800016

How Rainfall Variation Influences Reproductive Patterns of African Savanna Ungulates in an Equatorial Region Where Photoperiod Variation Is Absent	PLOS ONE												In high temperate latitudes, ungulates generally give birth within a narrow time window when conditions are optimal for offspring survival in spring or early summer, and use changing photoperiod to time conceptions so as to anticipate these conditions. However, in low tropical latitudes day length variation is minimal, and rainfall variation makes the seasonal cycle less predictable. Nevertheless, several ungulate species retain narrow birth peaks under such conditions, while others show births spread quite widely through the year. We investigated how within-year and between-year variation in rainfall influenced the reproductive timing of four ungulate species showing these contrasting patterns in the Masai Mara region of Kenya. All four species exhibited birth peaks during the putative optimal period in the early wet season. For hartebeest and impala, the birth peak was diffuse and offspring were born throughout the year. In contrast, topi and warthog showed a narrow seasonal concentration of births, with conceptions suppressed once monthly rainfall fell below a threshold level. High rainfall in the previous season and high early rains in the current year enhanced survival into the juvenile stage for all the species except impala. Our findings reveal how rainfall variation affecting grass growth and hence herbivore nutrition can govern the reproductive phenology of ungulates in tropical latitudes where day length variation is minimal. The underlying mechanism seems to be the suppression of conceptions once nutritional gains become insufficient. Through responding proximally to within-year variation in rainfall, tropical savanna ungulates are less likely to be affected adversely by the consequences of global warming for vegetation phenology than northern ungulates showing more rigid photoperiodic control over reproductive timing.

We estimated the proportion of the population surviving a second hibernation period. The appearance of ovigerous females in late spring was followed by a strong decline in the number of adults, the appearance of a high percentage of juveniles in late summer (0.58 ind./m(2)), and their subsequent disappearance from the shore in winter. A small semivoltine cohort survived a second winter. The average life span was 12-15 (max. 29) months under laboratory conditions. In molecular studies (COX I), the Upper Rhine and Southern France populations clustered within the North Africa/West-Central Europe species clade. Due to its low productivity, this invasive species is unlikely to cause management problems.																	0011-216X	1568-5403				AUG	2015	88	9					949	962		10.1163/15685403-00003470								WOS:000364107300001

We used mechanistic and correlative niche models to quantify and map the global patterns of the potential for establishment of codling moth (Cydia pomonella L.), a major pest of apples, peaches, pears, and other pome and stone fruits, and a quarantine pest in countries where it currently does not occur. The mechanistic model CLIMEX was calibrated using species-specific physiological tolerance thresholds, whereas the correlative model MaxEnt used species occurrences and climatic spatial data. Projected potential distribution from both models conformed well to the current known distribution of codling moth. None of the models predicted suitable environmental conditions in countries located between 20 degrees N and 20 degrees S potentially because of shorter photoperiod, and lack of chilling requirement (<60 d at <= 10 degrees C) in these areas for codling moth to break diapause. Models predicted suitable conditions in South Korea and Japan where codling moth currently does not occur but where its preferred host species (i.e., apple) is present. Average annual temperature and latitude were the main environmental variables associated with codling moth distribution at global level. The predictive models developed in this study present the global risk of establishment of codling moth, and can be used for monitoring potential introductions of codling moth in different countries and by policy makers and trade negotiators in making science-based decisions.

Host use of the endangered butterfly Euphydryas aurinia was investigated close to the northern limit of its European distribution. We experimentally studied host preference of ovipositing females and growth performance of pre-diapause larvae on different hosts, as well as made field observations on host use by surveying larval webs. In the field, Succisa pratensis has remained the only confirmed host of E. aurinia in Estonia. Also, in the laboratory, the females consistently preferred S. pratensis as oviposition substrate. Larval performance was the highest on S. pratensis though the insects were also able to develop on Knautia arvensis. By contrast, species of Plantago, or Valeriana officinalis, were not suitable for larval development. E. aurinia appears thus to be a host specialist in Estonia, even if the regional list includes a higher number of plant species. Our results confirm a pattern repeatedly recorded in Melitaeine butterflies, i.e. geographic differences in host use and local monophagy. As a methodological contribution, we showed that different lab-based methods yield consistent information on host use, though tend to somewhat overestimate the actual host range of the species in the field. Using larval growth rate as an index of host suitability appears problematic for species not time-stressed during their larval development, and survival is a more appropriate parameter to record.																	1366-638X	1572-9753				AUG	2015	19	4					691	702		10.1007/s10841-015-9792-3								WOS:000360850000009

Chemical and biological metal nanoparticles as antimycobacterial agents: A comparative study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS												Resistance among mycobacteria leading to multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis is a major threat. However, nanotechnology has provided new insights in drug delivery and medicine development. This is the first comparative report to determine the activity of chemically and biologically synthesised silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) against mycobacteria. Screening data revealed the high mycobactericidal efficiency of AgNPs, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of <3 mu g/mL, whereas no such activity was exhibited by AuNPs at concentrations up to 100 mu g/mL. Moreover, in vitro and ex vivo THP-1 infection model assays showed greater efficacy of chemical AgNPs compared with biogenic AgNPs to inhibit active and dormant stage mycobacterial growth. Up to 40% cytotoxicity against human cell lines was observed at a AgNP concentration of 10 x MIC (30 mu g/mL) after 48 h. AgNPs were shown to have more specificity towards mycobacteria than towards other Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria. The selectivity index was found to be in the range of 11-23, indicating the potential of these nanoparticles for use in developing new therapeutics for tuberculosis.

In this context, bees are of interest due to their pollination services. In southern Brazil, the highly eusocial bee species Plebeia droryana (Friese) (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Meliponini) exhibits reproductive diapause in response to the region's rigorous winters. That diapause is characterized by a temporary interruption in brood cell construction by nurse bees and egg-laying by the queen, regardless of other internal tasks underway in the nests. In this study, we evaluated whether P. droryana enter diapause under experimental conditions. P. droryana colonies were kept in a germination chamber, and the temperature was progressively reduced from 20 degrees C over a period of a few weeks until diapause was detected. Additionally, we also estimated the environmental conditions in the actual geographic range occupied by P. droryana and modeled it for predicted changes in climate up to the year 2080. Our findings indicate that P. droryana enter diapause between 10 and 8 degrees C. We also found that the current minimum winter temperature (10.1 degrees C, median) in the distributional range of P. droryana will probably rise (13.4 degrees C, median). Thus, if our experimental data are somewhat accurate, similar to 36% of the southern Brazilian P. droryana population may be active during the expected milder winter months in 2080. In this scenario, there may be a larger demand for pollen and nectar for that bee species. Greater conservation efforts will be required to preserve P. droryana populations and keep them viable in the coming decades.				dos Santos, Charles/F-8617-2012; Nunes-Silva, Patricia/B-2671-2013; Acosta, Andre/H-2036-2012; Saraiva, Antonio/B-6350-2011; Blochtein, Betina/B-9412-2014	dos Santos, Charles/0000-0001-5181-2461; Nunes-Silva, Patricia/0000-0002-9215-9822; Acosta, Andre/0000-0002-4244-9637; Saraiva, Antonio/0000-0003-2283-1123; Blochtein, Betina/0000-0001-8452-1716												0046-225X	1938-2936				AUG	2015	44	4					1172	1181		10.1093/ee/nvv064								WOS:000359668100027	26314063

In long-lived organisms such as trees, genetic adaptation is slow, and how much phenotypic plasticity can help them cope with climate change remains largely unknown. Here, we assess whether, where and when phenological plasticity is and will be adaptive in three major European tree species. We use a process-based species distribution model, parameterized with extensive ecological data, and manipulate plasticity to suppress phenological variations due to interannual, geographical and trend climate variability, under current and projected climatic conditions. We show that phenological plasticity is not always adaptive and mostly affects fitness at the margins of the species' distribution and climatic niche. Under current climatic conditions, phenological plasticity constrains the northern range limit of oak and beech and the southern range limit of pine. Under future climatic conditions, phenological plasticity becomes strongly adaptive towards the trailing edges of beech and oak, but severely constrains the range and niche of pine. Our results call for caution when interpreting geographical variation in trait means as adaptive, and strongly point towards species distribution models explicitly taking phenotypic plasticity into account when forecasting species distribution under climate change scenarios.

Previous studies have revealed that time-to-emergence can be altered by mutations in the core clock gene period (per), or by altering the length of LD cycles. Since this evidence came from studies on genetically manipulated flies, or on flies maintained under LD cycles with limited range of periods, inferences that can be drawn are limited. Moreover, the extent of shortening or lengthening of time-to-emergence remains yet unknown. In order to pursue this further, we assayed time-to-emergence of D. melanogaster under 12 different LD cycles as well as in constant light (LL) and constant dark conditions (DD). Time-to-emergence in flies occurred earlier under LL than in LD cycles and DD. Among the LD cycles, time-to-emergence occurred earlier under T4-T8, followed by T36-T48, and then T12-T32, suggesting that egg-to-emergence duration in flies becomes shorter when the length of LD cycles deviates from 24h, bearing a strong positive and a marginally negative correlation with day length, for values shorter and longer than 24h, respectively. These results suggest that the extent of mismatch between the period of circadian clocks and environmental cycles determines the time-to-emergence in Drosophila.

It overwinters as full-grown larvae in plant stalks or in a spun-silk covering located in the plant debris in the temperate regions of China. Supercooling point (SCP) and survival rate after low sub-zero temperature treatment were assessed for field-collected populations in the laboratory using a cool bath with a 1 degrees C/min cooling rate until -40 degrees C. Mean SCPs were varied among geographical populations, with a significant decline from -22.7 degrees C of Haikou, the multivoltine tropical population in the south, to -28.5 degrees C of Gongzhuling, the univoltine temperate population in the northeast of China. In addition, there was more than 1 degrees C difference in SCP between Gongzhuling univoltine and bivoltine populations that were from the same geographic origin. Mean SCPs of the Guangzhou population fluctuated over the year, with significantly lower SCPs in winter than in other seasons, which correlated with a significantly higher proportion of diapausing larvae in winter than in other seasons. Over 41% of overwintering larvae from the northeast population could withstand to be supercooled for a few minutes to the low sub-zero temperature of -40 degrees C, but only 6.7% of their southern counterparts did so. The findings from this study suggest that O. furnacalis mostly takes advantage of freeze avoidance as diapausing larvae for overwintering in the southern region, whereas it exhibits freeze tolerance in diapause in the northeastern region.																	1672-9609	1744-7917				AUG	2015	22	4					578	586		10.1111/1744-7917.12137								WOS:000358380600011	24802514

However, nothing is known about how this physical control method affects population genetics of these moths. Focusing on the oriental fruit moth, Grapholita (= Cydia) molesta (Busck) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), we used five polymorphic microsatellite loci and two mitochondrial gene sequences to investigate the genetic diversity and genetic structure of populations from three fruit-bagged and two unbagged apple orchards in five regions of a major fruit-growing area of China. We sampled each orchard 39 during the season and found high genetic diversity in the samples of populations collected. Populations from fruit-bagged and unbagged orchards were genetically significantly differentiated, indicating a clear effect of the pest management method applied. Genetic structures of the populations under a given management regime changed in the course of the season in a characteristic manner, and within the same regime, patterns were always similar at a given sampling time. There was no significant isolation by geographical distance. Population genetics from both orchard types did not resemble one another at the beginning of the season, but they did rather at the end. Potential reasons for this unexpected direction of change in population genetic structure are discussed, and we hypothesize that diapause-related characteristics may account for the patterns observed. The current study documents that pest management methods applied can have an important impact on the genetic diversity and genetic structure of targeted pest insect populations.																	0013-8703	1570-7458				AUG	2015	156	2					117	127		10.1111/eea.12316								WOS:000357732600002

Nonlinear response of vegetation green-up to local temperature variations in temperate and boreal forests in the Northern Hemisphere	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The annual cycle of vegetation growth may be altered in response to climate changes affecting ecosystem dynamics. However, our understanding of vegetation seasonality is mostly limited to the mechanisms and attributes of phenological events, such as spring emergence and fall senescence. Here we have investigated the seasonal evolution of vegetation growth from winter dormancy to summer maturity of four forest types in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) temperate and boreal forests for 1982-2011. The present study assesses large-scale variations in the vegetation green-up rate (VG(rate)) and its connection to temperature variability using remotely sensed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and surface air temperature. The average of the VG(ate) of the analysis period increases with latitude, which indicates that the canopy develops more rapidly from dormancy to maturity for vegetation in higher-latitude or colder climate zones. VG(rate) and precedent temperature also show a positive correlation (r) over temperate and boreal forests (67% of the forest area in the NH), indicating that increased temperatures lead to faster canopy development within the same climate zone or latitude band. Responsiveness of VG(rate) to temperature variability shows that despite the same magnitude of local temperature variability during extremely cold and warm years, the magnitude of VG(rate) acceleration in warm years (0.07 (15-day)(-1)) is larger than the VG(rate) deceleration in cold years (-0.03 (15-day)(-1)), suggesting that the response of VG(rate) to temperature variability is nonlinear. Among the four forest types examined in this study, the nonlinear responses are most clearly observed in deciduous broadleaf forests indicating that forest composition may regulate the large-scale response of canopy development to temperature variability. Overall, our results suggest that anomalous seasonal warming will significantly affect canopy developments over wide deciduous forest areas. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Multiply to conquer: Copy number variations at Ppd-B1 and Vrn-A1 facilitate global adaptation in wheat	BMC GENETICS												Background: Copy number variation was found to be a frequent type of DNA polymorphism in the human genome often associated with diseases but its importance in crops and the effects on agronomic traits are still largely unknown. Results: Here, we employed a large worldwide panel of 1110 winter wheat varieties to assess the frequency and the geographic distribution of copy number variants at the Photoperiod-B1 (Ppd-B1) and the Vernalization-A1 (Vrn-A1) loci as well as their effects on flowering time under field conditions. We identified a novel four copy variant of Vrn-A1 and based on the phylogenetic relationships among the lines show that the higher copy variants at both loci are likely to have arisen independently multiple times. In addition, we found that the frequency of the different copy number variants at both loci reflects the environmental conditions in the varieties' region of origin and based on multi-location field trials show that Ppd-B1 copy number has a substantial effect on the fine-tuning of flowering time. Conclusions: In conclusion, our results show the importance of copy number variation at Ppd-B1 and Vrn-A1 for the global adaptation of wheat making it a key factor for wheat success in a broad range of environments and in a wider context substantiate the significant role of copy number variation in crops.

In the long-distance migratory barn swallow Hirundo rustica, individuals bearing the rare Clock allele with the largest number of C-terminal polyglutamine repeats found in this species (Q(8)) show a delayed reproduction and moult later. We explored the association between Clock polymorphism and migration scheduling, as gauged by light-level geolocators, in two barn swallow populations (Switzerland; Po Plain, Italy). Genetic polymorphism was low: 91% of the 64 individuals tracked year-round were Q(7)/Q(7) homozygotes. We compared the phenology of the rare genotypes with the phenotypic distribution of Q(7)/Q(7) homozygotes within each population. In Switzerland, compared to Q(7)/Q(7), two Q(6)/Q(7) males departed earlier from the wintering grounds and arrived earlier to their colony in spring, while a single Q(7)/Q(8) female was delayed for both phenophases. On the other hand, in the Po Plain, three Q(6)/Q(7) individuals had a similar phenology compared to Q(7)/Q(7).

Evolutionary genomics of Culex pipiens: global and local adaptations associated with climate, life-history traits and anthropogenic factors	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												We present the first genome-wide study of recent evolution in Culex pipiens species complex focusing on the genomic extent, functional targets and likely causes of global and local adaptations. We resequenced pooled samples of six populations of C. pipiens and two populations of the outgroup Culex torrentium. We used principal component analysis to systematically study differential natural selection across populations and developed a phylogenetic scanning method to analyse admixture without haplotype data. We found evidence for the prominent role of geographical distribution in shaping population structure and specifying patterns of genomic selection. Multiple adaptive events, involving genes implicated with autogeny, diapause and insecticide resistance were limited to specific populations. We estimate that about 5-20% of the genes (including several histone genes) and almost half of the annotated pathways were undergoing selective sweeps in each population. The high occurrence of sweeps in non-genic regions and in chromatin remodelling genes indicated the adaptive importance of gene expression changes. We hypothesize that global adaptive processes in the C. pipiens complex are potentially associated with South to North range expansion, requiring adjustments in chromatin conformation. Strong local signature of adaptation and emergence of hybrid bridge vectors necessitate genomic assessment of populations before specifying control agents.

Room temperature (25 degrees C) and photoperiod (12L:12D) were fixed. Fish were fed twice-a-day with commercial diet (28% crude protein) until satiation. After acclimation, whole body oxygen consumption was measured and fish were euthanized and sampled for blood, gills, and liver. Whole body oxygen consumption and plasma osmolality did not change in the range of salinities tested. The isosmotic point was estimated as 412.7 mOsmol kg(-1) (13.5 parts per thousand). Gill Na+,K+-ATPase activity tended to be lower at 20 and 30%, while liver glycogen content was significantly higher at 20% than at 5 and 40 parts per thousand. These results indicate that juvenile M. liza is able to acclimate for a short-period of time (15 days) to a wide range of salinities (5-40 parts per thousand). This condition is achieved through adjustments in gill Na+,K+-ATPase activity and carbohydrate metabolism to regulate plasma osmolality and aerobic/energy metabolism. Therefore, our findings support the idea of catching juveniles M. liza in sea water and rear them in estuarine and marine waters.																	1679-6225					JUL-SEP	2015	13	3					591	598		10.1590/1982-0224-20140123								WOS:000361969500012

The presented protocols, based on whole-plant bioassays performed in a greenhouse, can be readily adapted to a wide range of weed species and herbicides through appropriate variants. Seed samples from plants that survived a field herbicide treatment are collected and stored dry at low temperature until used. Germination methods differ according to weed species and seed dormancy type. Seedlings at similar growth stage are transplanted and maintained in the greenhouse under appropriate conditions until plants have reached the right growth stage for herbicide treatment. Accuracy is required to prepare the herbicide solution to avoid unverifiable mistakes. Other critical steps such as the application volume and spray speed are also evaluated. The advantages of this protocol, compared to others based on whole plant bioassays using one herbicide dose, are related to the higher reliability and the possibility of inferring the resistance level. Quicker and less expensive in vivo or in vitro diagnostic screening tests have been proposed (Petri dish bioassays, spectrophotometric tests), but they provide only qualitative information and their widespread use is hindered by the laborious set-up that some species may require. For routine resistance testing, the proposed whole plant bioassay can be applied at only one herbicide dose, so reducing the costs.

Diapause Response to Photoperiod in an Arizona Population of Lygus hesperus (Hemiptera: Miridae)	JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGICAL SCIENCE												The western tarnished plant bug (Lygus hesperus Knight) is an important crop pest in the western United States that overwinters in an adult diapause. However, knowledge of L. hesperus diapause is incomplete. Eggs from field-collected adults were reared under photoperiods of 10:14, 11:13, 12:12, and 13:11 (L:D) h at 26.7 +/- 1 degrees C, and the diapause response for each gender was modeled by a logistic function. Incidence of a recently reported "glass bead" fat body type also was examined. Validation studies using the same methods were subsequently conducted using photoperiods of 10.5:13.5, 11.5:12.5, and 12.5:11.5 (L:D) h. No effects of bug gender, photoperiod, or diapause status on occurrence of the novel fat type were detected. Estimates of diapause in validation studies were within confidence intervals for initial predictions, but systematic deviations from initial predictions prompted refitting of the models to include validation data. Refitted functions estimated critical photoperiods of 11h44min for females and 11h21min for males. The maximum incidence of diapause was lower for males than for females and was <100% for both genders. Refitted functions also predicted 50% of the population-specific maximum diapause response corresponded to photoperiods of 11h54min (females) and 12h7min (males). These results, combined with other recent findings, suggest heterogeneity in diapause response likely enables L. hesperus populations to adapt to local conditions. The estimated functions relating photoperiod to diapause incidence provide baselines to facilitate future studies of environmental and geographical influences on diapause in this species.																	0749-8004					JUL	2015	50	3					238	247										WOS:000361079400007

On the origin of Yersinia pestis, a causative agent of the plague: A concept of population-genetic macroevolution in transitive environment	ZHURNAL OBSHCHEI BIOLOGII												An ecological scenario is proposed for the origin of causative agent of the plague (the bacterium Yersenia pestis) from the clone of pseudotuberculous microbe of the first serotype Y. pseudotuberculosis O:1b. Disclosed are the conditions of gradual intrusion of psychrophile saprozoonosis ancestor into the blood of the primary host, Mongolian tarbagan marmot Marmota sibirica. As an inductor of speciation acted the Sartan cooling that occurred in the end of late Pleistocene under conditions of arid ultra-continental climate in Central Asia. Soil freezing down to the level of hibernating chambers in marmot burrows initiated the transition of marmot flea, Oropsylla silantiewi, larvae to optional hemophagy on the mucous coat inside the mouth cavity of sleeping marmots. In its turn, this promoted the conditions of mass traumatic intrusion of Y pseudotuberculosis into marmots bloodstream from faecal particles getting in their mouth cavity in course of building up a plug in a burrow for hibernating. In marmot populations, the selection of bacteria underwent under conditions of heterothermy with repeated changes of hibernating marmots body temperature within the range of 5-37 degrees C (torpor-euthermy). During the warm season, when pseudotuberculous microbes are totally eliminated from the bloodstream of healthy marmots with body temperature about 37 degrees C, bacteria could survive in fleas' digestive tract in the form of biofilm developing in proventriculus as a so called blockage. Final isolation between ancestral and daughter species was helped by the development of intrapopulation antagonism related with the beginning of full-scale synthesis of bacteriocin pesticin. Population-genetic processes in the "marmot-flea" system have led to a macroevolutionary event, that is, to passage of bacteria in a new ecological niche and adaptive zone that are principally different from those of the ancestor. All the present intraspecies forms of Y pestis that appeared due to microevolution, have originated with the subspecies Y pestis tarbagani that has formed in Central Asia during the Sartan cooling.																	0044-4596					JUL-AUG	2015	76	4					310	318										WOS:000360028700006	26353398

In the present study, a population of 163 recombinant inbred lines was derived from a cross between an elite line (WCB414) and an exotic line (WCB617) with branched spike (supernumerary spikelet; SS) head morphology. The population was evaluated over four to six environments to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with nine spike-related traits and 10 agronomic traits. A genetic map consisting of 939 diversity arrays technology (DArT) markers was constructed. Composite interval mapping identified a total of 143 QTL located on 17 different wheat chromosomes and included 33 consistent and definitive QTL. The amount of phenotype variation explained (PVE) by individual QTL ranged from 0.61 to 91.8%. One major QTL for glume pubescence was located in a QTL-rich region on the short arm of chromosome 1A, where loci for other traits such as for kernels per spike (KS) and spike length (SL) were also identified. Similarly, a cluster of QTL associated with yield-related, agronomic and spike-related traits contributing up to 40.3% of PVE was found on the short arm of chromosome 2D, in the vicinity of a major QTL for SS-related traits. Consistent and major QTL identified in the present study may be useful in markerassisted breeding programs to facilitate transfer of desirable alleles into other germplasm. Desirable QTL alleles were also contributed by the exotic line, suggesting the possibility of enriching the breeding germplasm with alleles from SS genotypes.																	1940-3372					JUL	2015	8	2								10.3835/plantgenome2014.12.0089								WOS:000358444200024

Density-Dependent Oviposition by Female Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae) Spreads Eggs Among Containers During the Summer but Accumulates Them in the Fall	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY												When possible, oviparous females should deposit eggs in sites that maximize the future performance of their offspring. Therefore, studies of oviposition behavior may uncover parameters important to offspring fitness. Gravid female Aedes albopictus (Skuse) were given a choice of containers with leaf infusion or plain water, either open or with a cover with a small opening, and their behavior was compared under summer (long day, higher temperature) or fall (short day, lower temperature) regimes. Open containers with leaf infusion were always preferred, but over time, summer females expanded their choices to oviposit in all containers and follow-up experiments indicated that the number of eggs laid was inversely correlated to the number of eggs present. In contrast, fall females laying diapausing eggs that do not hatch until the spring, accumulated eggs in open containers with food resulting in high egg densities. Combined, these results demonstrate a seasonal shift that suggests either high winter egg mortality or safety in numbers. It also demonstrates that female Ae. albopictus change their behavior based on cues associated with expected added risk, which varies across time and space. The wide distribution of summer eggs across container types may contribute to the fast expansion of Ae. albopictus across its invasive range, but egg accumulation in the fall may be exploited for control.

Avoiding the crowds: the evolution of plastic responses to seasonal cues in a density-dependent world	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Across a range of organisms, life-history transitions can be triggered by specific levels of seasonal cues, such as day length or temperature. This acts to regulate the life cycle relative to seasonal fluctuations, so that, for example, reproduction occurs when resources are most abundant. At an environmentally optimal cue level, individuals might be selected to respond in a similar way, and consequently abruptly increase population density through, for example, the production of offspring. However, if density dependence is operating, crowding will reduce individual fitness, and selection will then favour life-history transitions at different cue levels. We explore the eco-evolutionary dynamics that result from the interaction between density dependence and phenology using a life-history model of an annual plant and focus on the timing of seed germination within the year. We characterize the adaptive dynamics of the mean and variance across the year of germination timing. Our results indicate that, even in predictably varying environments, mean timing of germination is not evolutionarily stable, but may experience evolutionary branching if variance in germination timing is sufficiently constrained. Unpredictably varying environments extend contexts where this is the case.Synthesis. Even if there is a restricted time period in the year during which environmental conditions are most appropriate for germination, observed timing of germination might be very diverse. Density dependence selects for persistence of traits conferring variance in timing across the year and additionally can lead to evolutionary branching of mean germination timing, resulting in multiple coexisting genotypes corresponding to different mean germination timings.

(Common ragweed) that are relevant to understanding its ecology. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, and history, conservation, impacts and management.Ambrosia artemisiifolia is a monoecious, wind-pollinated, annual herb native to North America whose height varies from 10cm to 2.5m, according to environmental conditions. It has erect, branched stems and pinnately lobed leaves. Spike-like racemes of male capitula composed of staminate (male) florets terminate the stems, while cyme-like clusters of pistillate (female) florets are arranged in groups in the axils of main and lateral stem leaves. Seeds require prolonged chilling to break dormancy. Following seedling emergence in spring, the rate of vegetative growth depends on temperature, but development occurs over a wide thermal range. In temperate European climates, male and female flowers are produced from summer to early autumn (July to October).Ambrosia artemisiifolia is sensitive to freezing. Late spring frosts kill seedlings and the first autumn frosts terminate the growing season. It has a preference for dry soils of intermediate to rich nutrient level.Ambrosia artemisiifolia was introduced into Europe with seed imports from North America in the 19th century. Since World War II, it has become widespread in temperate regions of Europe and is now abundant in open, disturbed habitats as a ruderal and agricultural weed. Recently, the North American ragweed leaf beetle (Ophraella communa) has been detected in southern Switzerland and northern Italy. This species appears to have the capacity to substantially reduce growth and seed production of A.artemisiifolia. In heavily infested regions of Europe, A.artemisiifolia causes substantial crop-yield losses and its copious, highly allergenic pollen creates considerable public health problems. There is a consensus among models that climate change will allow its northward and uphill spread in Europe.

Population structuring in the monogonont rotifer Synchaeta pectinata: high genetic divergence on a small geographical scale	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Like many other zooplankton species, individual species of planktonic freshwater rotifers often possess a cosmopolitan distribution despite inhabiting isolated habitats (e.g. ponds or lakes) that present little opportunity for direct gene flow. This everything is everywhere' distribution is typically ascribed to aspects of the life history of these animals (heterogonic reproductive strategy) in combination with the high dispersal capabilities presented by a dormant stage (resting eggs). Recent molecular analyses indicate the presence of strong population structuring in many rotifer species, including both phylogeographic structuring and the potential for cryptic speciation. Building on these studies, we investigated the intraspecific genetic structuring in the mitochondrial barcoding marker cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) among mid-European populations of the cosmopolitan rotifer Synchaeta pectinata (Rotifera, Monogononta). These data were analysed using a combination of phylogenetic analysis and haplotype networks as well as population-genetic methods to assess the degree of population and geographic structuring. Gene flow among four neighbouring populations in north-west Germany (126 individuals; regional scale) and between them and a set of populations from northern Italy (an additional 48 individuals based on literature data; mid-European scale) was generally low. Paradoxically, however, higher genetic similarity occurred across the broader mid-European scale than within the regional scale. Nevertheless, no significant correlation with spatial distance was detected at the former scale, rejecting an isolation-by-distance model for population differentiation. Most populations comprised several distinct haplotype clusters, each corresponding to ancient mitochondrial lineages of S.pectinata. Although it is common to infer cryptic speciation from results such as these, the pattern we observed can also arise through historical colonisation events and/or persistent founder effects (Monopolization hypothesis) and we present potential arguments against the default assumption that S.pectinata comprises a complex of cryptic species.

J	Larsdotter-Mellstrom, H; Wiklund, C				Larsdotter-Mellstrom, Helena; Wiklund, Christer			Different mating expenditure in response to sperm competition risk between generations in the bivoltine butterfly Pieris napi	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY												Examining how the response to sperm competition risk varies in a population is essential in order to understand variation in reproductive success and mating system. In polyandrous butterflies, males transfer a large spermatophore at mating that delays female remating and confers an advantage in sperm competition. However, as large ejaculates are costly to produce-male expenditure on ejaculate size should be selected to vary with risk of sperm competition, as previously shown in the butterfly Pieris napi. In P. napi, adults can either emerge after winter diapause, or they can emerge as a directly developing generation later in the summer. Post-diapause adults have fewer developmental constraints because direct developers have to grow, develop, emerge, mate, and reproduce during a more limited seasonal timeframe, and as a result are more time-stressed. The two generations show polyphenisms in a variety of traits including polyandry, pheromone production, mating propensity, and sexual maturity at eclosion. Using these within-species, between-generation differences in ecology, we generated three important findings: (1) that both generations respond to an immediate risk of elevated sperm competition and significantly raise ejaculate investment, (2) that the diapausing generation raises this investment by a far greater 65 % increase compared with the direct generation males' 28 %, and (3) that males show a graded response relative to sperm competition risk and increase their ejaculate investment in relation to the actual level of mate competition. The difference in male mating allocation between generations may help explain life history evolution and geographic differences in mating patterns.

The seasonality of pest attacks on crops is affected by biotic and abiotic factors, for example, climate and natural enemies. Besides that, characteristics of the host plant, crop management, location and the pests' bioecology also affect this seasonality. The mites Polyphagotarsonemus latus (Prostigmata: Tarsonemidae) and Tetranychus bastosi (Prostigmata: Tetranychidae) are the most important pests in the cultivation of physic nut, Jatropha curcas (Euphorbiaceae). All parts of J. curcas can be used for a wide range of purposes. In addition many researchers have studied its potential for use as neat oil, as transesterified oil (biodiesel), or as a blend with diesel. However studies about physic nut pests have been little known. The objective of this study was to assess the seasonal variation of P. latus and T. bastosi in physic nut. This study was conducted at three sites in the state of Tocantins, Brazil. We monitored climatic elements and the densities of the two mite species and of their natural enemies for a period of 2 years. Attack by P. latus occurred during rainy seasons, when the photoperiod was short and the physic nut had new leaves. In contrast, attack by T. bastosi occurred during warmer seasons with longer photoperiods and stronger winds. Populations of both mites and their natural enemies were greater in sites with greater plant diversity adjacent to the plantations. The predators found in association with P. latus and T. bastosi were Euseius concordis (Acari: Phytoseiidae), spiders, Stethorus sp. (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) and Chrysoperla sp. (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae).

However, relative durations of successive ontogenetic stages often remain nearly constant across a substantial range of temperatures. This pattern, termed ` developmental rate isomorphy' (DRI) in insects, appears to be widespread and reported departures from DRI are generally very small. We show that these conclusions may be due to the caveats hidden in the statistical methods currently used to study DRI. Because the DRI concept is inherently based on proportional data, we propose that Dirichlet regression applied to individual-level data is an appropriate statistical method to critically assess DRI. As a case study we analyze data on five aquatic and four terrestrial insect species. We find that results obtained by Dirichlet regression are consistent with DRI violation in at least eight of the studied species, although standard analysis detects significant departure from DRI in only four of them. Moreover, the departures from DRI detected by Dirichlet regression are consistently much larger than previously reported. The proposed framework can also be used to infer whether observed departures from DRI reflect life history adaptations to size-or stage-dependent effects of varying temperature. Our results indicate that the concept of DRI in insects and other ectotherms should be critically re-evaluated and put in a wider context, including the concept of ` equiproportional development' developed for copepods.

It occurs also in tropical Southeast Asia and the North American Pacific coast, and the populations there are thought to have been introduced from Japan by ship. To test this hypothesis, the genetic divergence among geographic populations of A. togoi was studied using one mitochondrial and three nuclear gene sequences. We detected 71 mitochondrial haplotypes forming four lineages, with high nucleotide diversity around temperate Japan and declining towards peripheral ranges. The major lineage (L1) comprised 57 haplotypes from temperate and subarctic zones in Japan and Southeast Asia including southern China and Taiwan. Two other lineages were found from subtropical islands (L3) and a subarctic area (L4) of Japan. The Canadian population showed one unique haplotype (L2) diverged from the other lineages. In the combined nuclear gene tree, individuals with mitochondrial L4 haplotypes diverged from those with the other mitochondrial haplotypes L1-L3; although individuals with L1-L3 haplotypes showed shallow divergences in the nuclear gene sequences, individuals from Southeast Asia and Canada each formed a monophyletic group. Overall, the genetic composition of the Southeast Asian populations was closely related to that of temperate Japanese populations, suggesting recent gene flow between these regions. The Canadian population might have originated from anthropogenic introduction from somewhere in Asia, but the possibility that it could have spread across the Beringian land bridge cannot be ruled out.

Reduction of Optimal Thermal Range in Aging Western Cherry Fruit Flies (Diptera: Tephritidae)	JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE												The western cherry fruit fly is an economically important pest of sweet cherries in the western United States. The potential of this pest to establish and spread in areas in which it is not currently present has been the focus of recent research. Most published information on the thermal tolerance and optimal thermal range of this pest has focused primarily on the diapausing pupae and predictive phenology models. Microrespirometry and differential calorimetry can be useful tools in describing the thermotolerance and optimal thermal range of insects. This methodology was employed to investigate the effects of western cherry fruit fly adult age on the optimal thermal range. Newly emerged flies exhibited the widest optimal thermal range spanning from 6.6 to 42.2 degrees C for a total range of 35.8 degrees C during heating scans of 0.4 degrees C/ min from 2 to 50 degrees C. This range diminished as the flies aged, with the shortest span observed with 28-d-old flies ranging from 10.5 to 37.8 degrees C, a span of 27.2 degrees C. Measurements of heat rate and oxygen consumption at isothermal, or static, temperatures indicated that all flies could survive exposure to 40 degrees C for at least 20 min, and that metabolism was greatly reduced, with a concomitant reduction in oxygen consumption rate at 40 to 42 degrees C. All flies exhibited a heat rate and oxygen consumption rate of zero when exposed to 45 and 50 degrees C. The loss of thermotolerance in adult flies can influence its ability to establish and spread in climates where daily temperatures exceed the optimal thermal range of this species.																	1536-2442	2250-2645				JUN 23	2015	15								77	10.1093/jisesa/iev059								WOS:000357720200005

(Orthoptera: Acridoidea)	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Low temperature induces diapause in locusts. However, the physiological processes and initiation mechanism of diapause are not well understood. To understand the molecular basis of diapause, 'omics' analyses were performed to examine the differences between diapause and non-diapause eggs at both transcriptional and translational levels. Results indicated that a total of 62,241 mRNAs and 212 proteins were differentially expressed. Among them, 116 transcripts had concurrent transcription and translation profiles. Up-regulated genes related to diapause included glutathionesS- transferase et al., and down-regulated genes including juvenile hormone esterase-like protein et al. KEGG analysis mapped 7,243 and 99 differentially expressed genes and proteins, to 83 and 25 pathways, respectively. Correlation enriched pathways indicated that there were nine identical pathways related to diapause. Gene Ontology analysis placed these genes and proteins into three categories, and a higher proportion of genes related to metabolism was up-regulated than downregulated. Furthermore, three up-regulated pathways were linked to cryoprotection. This study demonstrates the applicability of high-throughput omics tools to identify molecules linked to diapause in the locust. In addition, it reveals cellular metabolism in diapause eggs is more active than in non-diapause eggs, and up-regulated enzymes may play roles in cryoprotection and storing energy for diapause and post-diapause stages.																	2045-2322					JUN 19	2015	5								11402	10.1038/srep11402								WOS:000356534800001	26091374

PLOS ONE												The light regime is an ecologically important factor in pelagic habitats, influencing a range of biological processes. However, the availability and importance of light to these processes in high Arctic zooplankton communities during periods of 'complete' darkness (polar night) are poorly studied. Here we characterized the ambient light regime throughout the diel cycle during the high Arctic polar night, and ask whether visual systems of Arctic zooplankton can detect the low levels of irradiance available at this time. To this end, light measurements with a purpose-built irradiance sensor and coupled all-sky digital photographs were used to characterize diel skylight irradiance patterns over 24 hours at 79 degrees N in January 2014 and 2015. Subsequent skylight spectral irradiance and in-water optical property measurements were used to model the underwater light field as a function of depth, which was then weighted by the electrophysiologically determined visual spectral sensitivity of a dominant high Arctic zooplankter, Thysanoessa inermis. Irradiance in air ranged between 1-1.5 x 10(-5) mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1) (400-700 nm) in clear weather conditions at noon and with the moon below the horizon, hence values reflect only solar illumination. Radiative transfer modelling generated underwater light fields with peak transmission at blue-green wavelengths, with a 465 nm transmission maximum in shallow water shifting to 485 nm with depth. To the eye of a zooplankter, light from the surface to 75 m exhibits a maximum at 485 nm, with longer wavelengths (>600 nm) being of little visual significance. Our data are the first quantitative characterisation, including absolute intensities, spectral composition and photoperiod of biologically relevant solar ambient light in the high Arctic during the polar night, and indicate that some species of Arctic zooplankton are able to detect and utilize ambient light down to 20-30m depth during the Arctic polar night.

Hibernation and Oviposition Sites of Great Basin Gophersnakes (Pituophis catenifer deserticola) near Their Northern Range Limit	JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY												Northern range limits for snakes may result from thermal constraints, especially for oviposition and hibernation. We characterized hibernation and oviposition sites for federally threatened Great Basin Gophersnakes (Pituophis catenifer deserticola) near the edge of their northern-range limit in south central British Columbia, Canada. During 2006 and 2007, most Gophersnakes (75.8%) hibernated alone. At our more northern study area, typical hibernation sites were in grassy hillsides, whereas at our southern study areas snakes hibernated in rocky outcrops. All snakes that denned in rock outcrops reused sites over years, but only 28.6% of snakes that hibernated in rodent burrows reused sites. Most female Gophersnakes (94%) laid eggs in sites that were not used by other females, and reuse of sites was rare (12.5%). Almost all of the oviposition sites were in grassy slopes, with any shrubs and trees more than 5 m away; females selected grassy or sage-steppe cover for oviposition. This pattern of mostly individual and single-use hibernation and oviposition sites suggests that hibernation and oviposition sites are readily available as components of the active-season range within the sage-steppe ecozone, although this habitat is rare and severely threatened within Canada. In terms of species conservation, areas of suitable habitat should be protected based on active-season use, rather than by attempting to find hibernation sites supporting large aggregations of snakes. This recommendation is unlike that for Rattlesnakes (Crotalus spp.) and Gartersnakes (Thamnophis spp.), which often congregate at hibernation sites.																	0022-1511	1937-2418				JUN	2015	49	2					207	216		10.1670/13-162								WOS:000357360400007

Performance of Wild and Laboratory-Reared Gypsy Moth (Lepidoptera: Erebidae): A Comparison between Foliage and Artificial Diet	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												The effects of long-term mass rearing of laboratory insects on ecologically relevant traits is an important consideration when applying research conclusions to wild populations or developing management strategies. Laboratory strains of the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.), an invasive forest pest in North America, have been continuously reared since 1967. Selection on these strains has enhanced a variety of traits, resulting in faster development, shorter diapause, and greater fecundity. As in many mass-reared insects, laboratory strains of the gypsy moth are also reared exclusively on artificial diets that lack much of the phytochemical and nutritional complexity associated with natural foliage. We tested for differences in growth and development of wild gypsy moth populations from across the invasive range in comparison to laboratory strains when reared on artificial diet and a preferred foliage host species, northern red oak (Quercus rubra L.). Overall, caterpillars reared on foliage had higher survival and faster development rates, with smaller differences among populations. When reared on artificial diet, laboratory strains had the highest performance as expected. The response from the wild populations was mixed, with two populations performing poorly on artificial diet and another performing nearly as well as the laboratory strains. Performance on diet was enhanced when larvae received cubed portions changed regularly, as opposed to filled cups. Understanding these relationships between food source and population performance is important for informing studies that examine population comparisons using wild and laboratory-reared strains.

Diverse chitinases are invoked during the activity-dormancy transition in spruce	TREE GENETICS & GENOMES												North temperate tree species such as white spruce (Picea glauca [Moench] Voss) have evolved strategies to protect themselves against abiotic and biotic stresses that trees encounter during the inclement winter months. Chitinases not only play well-documented roles in plant defense but also function during physiological and developmental preparations for overwintering, including growth cessation, cold and desiccation acclimation, and dormancy acquisition. Phylogenetic analysis of 31 white spruce and 52 Norway spruce chitinases identified genes falling into each of the five clusters, which sometimes-but not always-separated the different biochemical classes of chitinases. Digital expression profiling of white spruce and Norway spruce chitinases across multiple conditions revealed a range of spatiotemporal expression patterns. Transcript abundance profiling in buds, needles, stems, and roots by quantitative RT-PCR suggested roles for eight white spruce chitinases during the growth-to-dormancy transition. In silico analyses of these eight sequences suggested that two cluster 2/class I chitinases function as chitinolytic enzymes in the tree's constitutive defense arsenal during the winter months. A cluster 2/class I, cluster 2/class II, and cluster 1/class IV chitinase each exhibit hallmarks of antifreeze proteins. Additionally, two cluster 2/class I chitinases and a cluster 1/class IV chitinase may serve as vegetative storage proteins. One cluster 3/class II chitinase exhibited attributes suggesting that it is a chitinase-like gene functioning in cell wall synthesis. Taken together, our results imply that dormancy-associated chitinases act in concert to (1) confer protection against freezing injury, pests, and pathogens, (2) store nitrogen, and (3) promote cell maturation that precedes growth cessation.

This is emphasized in insects, especially in ones that rely on discrete food resources, such as xylophagous insects. Psacothea hilaris hilaris (Pascoe) (Coleoptera Cerambycidae Lamiinae), an exotic beetle already established in Italy, is used as a model species for the study. The findings presented in this research increase knowledge of morphological and colourimetric traits in P. h. hilaris and support the hypothesis that environmental cues can impact certain important morphometric features of exotic insects. Principal component analysis (PCA) and Bayesian's posterior probability applied to the dimensions of specimens collected over a four-year period showed that some morphological parameters changed significantly over the years. According to PCA the most meaningful morphometric variables were body length, elytral length, and antenna-to-body length ratio. One of the most significant results is the variability of the antenna-to-body length ratio over the period of the study. In cerambycids longer antennae allow for better detection of host tree, oviposition site, and favour mating strategies. Consequently variability in this physical trait can influence the ability of the species to adapt to a new habitat.

The effect of photoperiod on life history and blood-feeding activity in Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae)	JOURNAL OF VECTOR ECOLOGY												Several studies have examined how climatic variables such as temperature and precipitation may affect life history traits in mosquitoes that are important to disease transmission. Despite its importance as a seasonal cue in nature, studies investigating the influence of photoperiod on such traits are relatively few. This study aims to investigate how photoperiod alters life history traits, survival, and blood-feeding activity in Aedes albopictus (Skuse) and Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus). We performed three experiments that tested the effects of day length on female survival, development time, adult size, fecundity, adult life span, and propensity to blood feed in Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti. Each experiment had three photoperiod treatments: 1) short-day (10L:14D), 2) control (12L:12D), and 3) long-day (14L:10D). Aedes albopictus adult females were consistently larger in size when reared in short-day conditions. Aedes aegypti adult females from short-day treatments lived longer and were more likely to take a blood meal compared to other treatments. We discuss how species-specific responses may reflect alternative strategies evolved to increase survival during unfavorable conditions. We review the potential impacts of these responses on seasonal transmission patterns, such as potentially increasing vectorial capacity of Ae. aegypti during periods of shorter day lengths.																	1948-7134					JUN	2015	40	1					164	171		10.1111/jvec.12146								WOS:000355851400020	26047197

We have mapped quantitative trait loci (QTL) responsible for the photoperiodic regulation of four life history traits, female reproductive diapause, cold tolerance, egg-to-eclosion development time and juvenile body weight in Drosophila montana strains from different latitudes in Canada and Finland. The F2 progeny of the cross was reared under a single photoperiod (LD cycle 16:8), which the flies from the Canadian population interpret as early summer and the flies from the Finnish population as late summer. The analysis revealed a unique QTL for diapause induction on the X chromosome and several QTL for this and the other measured traits on the 4th chromosome. Flies' cold tolerance, egg-to-eclosion development time and juvenile body weight had several QTL also on the 2nd, 3rd and 5th chromosome, some of the peaks overlapping with each other. These results suggest that while the downstream output of females' photoperiodic diapause response is partly under a different genetic control from that of the other traits in the given day length, all traits also share some QTL, possibly involving genes with pleiotropic effects and/or multiple tightly linked genes. Nonoverlapping QTL detected for some of the traits also suggest that the traits are potentially capable of independent evolution, even though this may be restricted by epistatic interactions and/or correlations and trade-offs between the traits.

The coincidence of very high/low pollen deposition years recorded in Tauber traps and aerobiological data obtained by volumetric samplers shows that these phenomena occur simultaneously in different places across vast areas of a tree's distribution range. The natural physiological rhythms displayed in abundance of flowering were considered on the basis of the observed data and published sources. The results obtained from applying Spearman's correlation to pollen accumulation rates from Roztocze and the meteorological parameters confirmed several statistically significant correlations between temperature and summer precipitation prior to pollen emission and a negative correlation with the winter temperature before pollen emission. Air temperature, precipitation, growing season duration (its start and end), winter length and the number of winter days with a daily mean temperature below 0 A degrees C were all considered. The best correlation coefficient results were obtained for the trees most abundant in the vegetation, namely Abies alba, Fagus sylvatica and Pinus sylvestris. Earlier findings on the controlling role of temperature and precipitation during the summer prior to pollen emission were confirmed, and a long period of winter dormancy was stressed as a factor favouring high pollen production. The examples from Roztocze reflected situations when a strong weather signal overrode the natural flowering rhythm. This was observable in the case of P. sylvestris, where pollen production reflected the air temperature of the previous summer or in the case of a mast year, which occurred across the whole distribution range of F. sylvatica in 2006.

Isolation and Characterization of Circadian Clock Genes in the Biofuel Plant Pongamia (Millettia pinnata)	BIOENERGY RESEARCH												The increasing human population has led to an inevitable increase in global energy demands. In the recent decades, biofuels have emerged as one of the potential solutions to the world's insatiable energy needs while reducing the high reliance on fossil fuels. Pongamia (Millettia pinnata), a nitrogen-fixing tree legume, has shown a great promise as an oil source for the production of biofuel with economical and environmental benefits. The generation of pongamia-derived biofuel is dependent on the success of flowering and seed development. However, molecular control of floral initiation pathways in pongamia remains largely unexplored. Photoperiod pathway has been reported to be one of the major checkpoints of plant flowering time and flower initiation. The circadian clock pathway, a part of the photoperiod pathways, is one of the key regulators of flowering time. Here, we report the identification of four pongamia circadian clock genes (ELF4, LCL1, PRR7, and TOC1) through the mapping of the pongamia transcriptome short-paired reads library, by using soybean circadian clock genes as the reference sequences. Furthermore, multiple alignments and phylogenetic analyses suggested that pongamia clock genes are conserved among legume crops such as soybean, Medicago, and garden pea. Gene expression studies highlight that pongamia circadian clock genes are diurnally regulated under long-day conditions. Thus, this study reports the isolation and characterization of circadian clock genes in pongamia and enhances our understanding of the molecular mechanism of flowering control in pongamia.

Inheritance of photoperiodic control of larval diapause in the Asian corn borer Ostrinia furnacalis (Guenee)	BULLETIN OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH												The Asian corn borer, Ostrinia furnacalis enters diapause as fully grown larvae. Owing to geographical variation in photoperiodic control of diapause, the subtropical strain from Hefei city (HF) enters diapause in response to short daylengths, whereas the tropical strain from Ledong county (LD) exhibits almost no diapause under the same conditions. The two strains were used in crosses to study the inheritance of diapause. The HF strain showed a typical long-day response with a critical daylength of approximately 14.97 h at 22 degrees C, 14.60 h at 25 degrees C and 13.68 h at 28 degrees C. The LD strain showed weak photoperiodic responses at 22 and 25 degrees C; and the F-1 progeny also showed a long-day response with significantly shorter critical daylength compared with the HF strain. However, the LD x HF (F x M) crosses had significantly longer critical daylengths than HF x LD crosses, indicating a sexual bias in the inheritance of diapause induction, with the male parent having more influence on the F-1 progeny. The critical daylength in a backcross to HF was significantly longer than a backcross to LD. Whether the inheritance of diapause fits an additive hypothesis or not depended on photoperiod, with results from different photoperiods showing additive inheritance or incomplete dominance of either diapause or non-diapause. Unlike diapause induction, the duration of diapause for reciprocal crosses was equally influenced by each parent, suggesting that diapause incidence and maintenance are controlled by separate systems in O. furnacalis.																	0007-4853	1475-2670				JUN	2015	105	3					326	334		10.1017/S0007485315000140								WOS:000354104000007	25779483

Integrating evolution in the management of captive zoo populations	EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS												Both natural animal populations and those in captivity are subject to evolutionary forces. Evolutionary changes to captive populations may be an important, but poorly understood, factor that can affect the sustainability of these populations. The importance of maintaining the evolutionary integrity of zoo populations, especially those that are used for conservation efforts including reintroductions, is critical for the conservation of biodiversity. Here, we propose that a greater appreciation for an evolutionary perspective may offer important insights that can enhance the reproductive success and health for the sustainability of captive populations. We provide four examples and associated strategies that highlight this approach, including minimizing domestication (i.e., genetic adaptation to captivity), integrating natural mating systems into captive breeding protocols, minimizing the effects of translocation on variation in photoperiodism, and understanding the interplay of parasites/pathogens and inflammation. There are a myriad of other issues that may be important for captive populations, and we conclude that these may often be species specific. Nonetheless, an evolutionary perspective may mitigate some of the challenges currently facing captive populations that are important from a conservation perspective, including their sustainability.																	1752-4571					JUN	2015	8	5					413	422		10.1111/eva.12258								WOS:000354408200002	26029256

Because insects in high-latitude environments are severely time constrained during summer, an effective diapause termination with careful regulation of metabolic rate is important. The present study examines whether diapausing Colorado potato beetles Leptinotarsa decemlineataSay originating from three latitudinally different regions in Europe differ in their quantitative or qualitative gas exchange patterns in response to an increasing temperature. Overall production of gaseous CO2, as well as qualitative patterns relating to the DGC, are measured at a late stage of diapause at four different temperatures in increasing order from 13, 18, 23 to 28 degrees C. Overall CO2 production is found to be lower in the two northern populations (61 degrees 49N and 55 degrees 75N) compared with the southernmost population (45 degrees 48N) but increases as a function of temperature in all populations in a similar way. However, in the northern populations, raising the temperature increases the amount of CO2 discharged during single DGC peaks, whereas the DGC frequency remains relatively unchanged. By contrast, in the southernmost population, the amount of CO2 discharged during individual DGC peaks remains relatively unchanged, whereas the DGC frequency increases as a function of temperature. The observed differences may relate to water retention benefits or, alternatively, energetic benefits relating to heightened gas exchange efficiency in hypoxic or hypercapnic environments. Overall, the results suggest that, although populations of L. decemlineata may have similar thermal sensitivities, they have different qualitative strategies to regulate metabolic re-activation at diapause termination.

Influence of Plant Community Composition on Biomass Production in Planted Grasslands	PLOS ONE												United States energy policy mandates increased use of renewable fuels. Restoring grasslands could contribute to a portion of this requirement through biomass harvest for bioenergy use. We investigated which plant community characteristics are associated with differences in biomass yield from a range of realistic native prairie plantings (n = 11; i.e., conservation planting, restoration, and wildlife cover). Our primary goal was to understand whether patterns in plant community composition and the Floristic Quality Index (FQI) were related to productivity as evidenced by dormant season biomass yield. FQI is an objective measure of how closely a plant community represents that of a pre-European settlement community. Our research was conducted in planted fields of native tallgrass prairie species, and provided a gradient in floristic quality index, species richness, species diversity, and species evenness in south-central Wisconsin during 2008 and 2009. We used a network of 15 randomly located 1 m(2) plots within each field to characterize the plant community and estimate biomass yield by clipping the plots at the end of each growing season. While plant community composition and diversity varied significantly by planting type, biomass yield did not vary significantly among planting types (ANOVA; P > 0.05). Biomass yield was positively correlated with plant community evenness, richness, C4 grass cover, and floristic quality index, but negatively correlated with plant species diversity in our multi-season multiple linear mixed effects models. Concordantly, plots with biomass yield in the lowest quartile (biomass yield <3500 kh/ha) had 8% lower plant community evenness and 9% lower FQI scores than those in the upper quartile (biomass yield > 5800 kh/ha). Our results suggest that promoting the establishment of fields with high species evenness and floristic quality may increase biomass yield, while simultaneously supporting biodiversity.																	1932-6203					MAY 27	2015	10	5							e0125758	10.1371/journal.pone.0125758								WOS:000355185600030	26018412					
J	Nakamura, K; Takashima, K				Nakamura, Keiji; Takashima, Kazuki			Geographical variation in diapause development in eggs of Sympetrum frequens (Odonata: Libellulidae)	APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY												Geographical differences causing variations in the egg period and the effects of environmental factors on diapause development were examined in Sympetum frequens (Selys), a univoltine species with an obligatory egg diapause for overwintering. Eggs were obtained from females collected from 11 localities in Japan and incubated under six different combinations of photoperiod and temperature. No clear geographical trends were found in the average egg period under any experimental treatment. Average hatch period (i.e., period from the date when 10 % of the eggs were hatched to the date when 90 % of the eggs were hatched) did not display any geographical trend at 25 and 20 degrees C. However, at 15 degrees C, a significant negative correlation was observed between the hatch period and the latitude of the collection site. Similarly, a significant correlation was also detected between the coefficient of variation in the egg period and the average annual temperature near the collection site, but only at 15 degrees C. Because each egg batch was divided into six groups which were then incubated under different experimental conditions, it was possible to discern that the rate of diapause development at 15 degrees C varies among eggs from southern populations. The large variations in the egg period in the southern populations at 15 degrees C were considered to be a risk-spreading strategy: a certain proportion of the eggs were able to maintain diapause until winter, even if the adults laid the eggs early in the season. These differences in the rate of diapause development within a population may be an adaptation to the unpredictable length of the summer-autumn period.																	0003-6862	1347-605X				MAY	2015	50	2					263	270		10.1007/s13355-015-0332-0								WOS:000355566800015

Molecular and pharmacological characterization of the Chelicerata pyrokinin receptor from the southern cattle tick, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus	INSECT BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY												We identified the first pyrokinin receptor (Rhimi-PKR) in Chelicerata and analyzed structure-activity relationships of cognate ligand neuropeptides and their analogs. Based on comparative and phylogenetic analyses, this receptor, which we cloned from larvae of the cattle tick Rhipicephalus microplus (Acari: Ixodidae), is the ortholog of the insect pyrokinin (PK)/pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide (PBAN)/diapause hormone (DH) neuropeptide family receptor. Rhimi-PKR functional analyses using calcium bioluminescence were performed with a developed stable recombinant CHO-RI cell line. Rhimi-PKR was activated by four endogenous PKs from the Lyme disease vector, the tick Ixodes scapularis (EC(50)s range: 85.4 nM-546 nM), and weakly by another tick PRX-amide peptide, periviscerokinin (PVK) (EC50 = 24.5 mu M). PR analogs with substitutions of leucine, isoleucine or valine at the C-terminus for three tick PR peptides, Ixosc-PK1, Ixosc-PK2, and Ixosc-PK3, retained their potency on Rhimi-PKR. Therefore, Rhimi-PKR is less selective and substantially more tolerant than insect PK receptors of C-terminal substitutions of leucine to isoleucine or valine, a key structural feature that serves to distinguish insect PR from PVK/CAP(2b) receptors. In females, ovary and synganglion had the highest Rhimi-PKR relative transcript abundance followed by the rectal sac, salivary glands, Malpighian tubules, and midgut. This is the first pharmacological analysis of a PK/PBAN/DH-like receptor from the Chelicerata, which will now permit the discovery of the endocrinological roles of this neuropeptide family in vectors of vertebrate pathogens.

Yet, other mutually nonexclusive explanations exist. Analysis of geographical patterns combined with laboratory experiments on the mechanisms of morph induction helps to unveil the adaptive value of particular cases of polyphenism. In the context of the thermal melanism hypothesis and seasonal adaptations, we explored an array of environmental factors that may affect the expression and performance of nonmelanic vs. melanic larval morphs in different latitudinal populations of the facultatively bivoltine moth Chiasmia clathrata (Lepidoptera: Geometridae). Geographical variation in larval coloration was independent of average temperatures experienced by the populations in the wild. The melanic morph was, however, more abundant in dry than in mesic habitats. In the laboratory, the melanic morph was induced especially under a high level of incident radiation but also at relatively high temperatures, but independently of photoperiod. Melanic larvae had higher growth rates and shorter development times than the nonmelanic ones when both temperature and the level of incident radiation were high. Our results that melanism is induced and advantageous in warm desiccating conditions contradict the thermal melanism hypothesis for this species. Neither has melanism evolved to compensate time constraints due to forthcoming autumn. Instead, larvae solve seasonal variation in the time available for growth by an elevated growth rate and a shortened larval period in the face of autumnal photoperiods. The phenotypic response to the level of incident radiation and a lack of adaptive adjustment of larval growth trajectories in univoltine populations underpin the role of deterministic environmental variation in the evolution of irreversible adaptive plasticity and seasonal polyphenism.

Thermoregulation and energetics in hibernating black bears: metabolic rate and the mystery of multi-day body temperature cycles	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY												Black bears overwintering in outdoor hibernacula in Alaska decrease metabolism to as low as 25 % basal rates, while core body temperature (T (b)) decreases from 37 to 38 A degrees C to a mid-hibernation average of 33 A degrees C. T (b) develops cycles of 1.6-7.3 days length within a 30-36 A degrees C range, with no circadian component. We do not know the mechanism or function underlying behind the T (b) cycles, although bears avoid T (b) of < 30 A degrees C and shorter cycles are predicted from higher rates of heat loss in colder conditions. To test this we manipulated den temperatures (T (den)) of 12 hibernating bears with body mass (BM) from 35.5 to 116.5 kg while recording T (b), metabolic rate (M), and shivering. T (b) cycle length (0.8-11.2 days) shortened as T (den) decreased (partial R (2) = 0.490, p < 0.001). Large bears with low thermal conductance (TC) showed more variation in T (b) cycle length with changes in T (den) than did smaller bears with high TC. Minimum T (b) across cycles was not consistent. At low T (den) bears shivered both during rising and decreasing phases of T (b) cycles, with minimum shivering during the fastest drop in T (b). At higher T (den) the T (b) pattern was more irregular. Mean M through T (b) cycles was negatively correlated to T (den) below lower critical temperatures (1.4-10.4 A degrees C). Minimum M (0.3509 W/kg +/- A 0.0121 SE) during mid-hibernation scaled to BM [M (W) = 1.217 x BM (kg)(0.6979), R (2) = 0.855, p < 0.001]. Hibernating thermal conductance (TC) was negatively correlated to BM (R (2) = 0.721, p < 0.001); bears with high TC had the same T (b) cycle length as bears with low TC except at high T (den), thus not supporting the hypothesis that cooling rate alone determines T (b) cycle length. We conclude that T (b) cycling is effected by control of thermoregulatory heat production, and T (b) cycling may not be present when hibernating bears use passive thermoregulation. More intense shivering in the rising phase of cycles may contribute to the prevention of muscle disuse atrophy. Bears hibernating in cold conditions use more energy during hibernation than in warmer conditions. At T (den) below lower critical temperature, no extra energy expenditure results from T (b) cycling compared to keeping a stable T (b).

Weak photoperiodic response facilitates the biological invasion of the harlequin ladybird Harmonia axyridis (Pallas) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae)	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY												Photoperiodic regulation of reproductive diapause in two invasive and two native populations of Harmonia axyridis and in one native population of Harmonia yedoensis was investigated in laboratory at 20 degrees C, five photoperiods (day length of 10, 12, 14, 16 and 18h) and two diets: (i) eggs of the Angoumois grain moth Sitotroga cerealella and (ii) the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae. Laboratory strains originated from native populations of H.axyridis from Irkutsk province of Siberia and H.yedoensis from South Korea showed a strong photoperiodic response: under short photoperiods (10-14h and 10-12h for H.axyridis and H.yedoensis, correspondingly), all females which fed on eggs and most of those fed on aphids did not start to lay eggs during 40days after emergence, while under long photoperiods, all females fed on aphids and most of those fed on eggs oviposited. The photoperiodic response of H.axyridis from South Korea was less strong: on the both diets, the range of the photoperiodic response (the difference in the proportion of ovipositing females between the treatments with long and short days) was ca 40%. In the European (Czech Republic) and in the Caucasian (Sochi region, Russia) invasive populations of H.axyridis, the photoperiodic response was very weak: the proportion of females that started oviposition (when fed on aphids) or at least reproductive maturation (when fed on eggs) during 40days after emergence was close to 100%, independently of the photoperiodic conditions. Obviously, instead of a rapid micro-evolutionary adaptation of the critical day length to a new climate, the invasive populations of the harlequin ladybird decrease their dependence on photoperiod and thus the weak photoperiodic response of SE Asian population of H.axyridis can be considered as a pre-adaptation further developed during the invasion.					, Natalia/0000-0002-9192-5871												0931-2048	1439-0418				MAY	2015	139	4					241	249		10.1111/jen.12158								WOS:000352725800001

The Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, is an invasive pest of potato that has rapidly spread from low latitudes to higher latitudes. During the last 30 years, a decrease in range expansion speed is apparent in Europe. We use a comparative approach to assess whether this could be due to an inability of L. decemlineata to cope with the harsher winters encountered at high latitude, when compared to two native northern chrysomelid beetles with similar overwintering ecology. We investigated several cold-tolerance-related physiological traits at different time points during winter. Cold tolerance followed a latitudinal pattern; the northern species were more tolerant to short-term subzero temperatures than the invasive L. decemlineata. The other northern species, the knotgrass leaf beetle, Chrysolina polita, was found to tolerate internal freezing. Interestingly, the pattern for overwinter survival at 5 degrees C was the opposite and higher in L. decemlineata than the northern species and could be related to behavioral differences between species in overwintering location selection and a potential physiological trade-off between tolerance to cold shock and to chronic cold exposure. Furthermore, while the northern species accumulated large amounts of different sugars and polyols with probable cryoprotectant functions, none were detected in L. decemlineata at high concentrations. This lack of cryoprotectant accumulation could explain the difference in cold tolerance between the species and also suggests that a lack of physiological capacity to tolerate low temperatures could slow further latitudinal range expansion of L. decemlineata.

To facilitate gene expression studies and obtain more accurate RT-qPCR data, normalization relative to stable reference genes is required. In this study, expression profiles of seven candidate reference genes, including beta-actin (Actin), elongation factor 1 a (EF1A), glyceralde hyde-3-phosphate dehydro-genase (GAPDH), cyclophilins A (CypA), vacuolartype H+-ATPase (ATPase), 28S ribosomal RNA (28S), and 18S ribosomal RNA (18S) from Hippodamia convergens were investigated. H. convergens is an abundant predatory species in the New World, and has been widely used as a biological control agent against sapsucking insect pests, primarily aphids. A total of four analytical methods, geNorm, Normfinder, BestKeeper, and the Delta Ct method, were employed to evaluate the performance of these seven genes as endogenous controls under diverse experimental conditions. Additionally, RefFinder, a comprehensive evaluation platform integrating the four above mentioned algorithms, ranked the overall stability of these candidate genes. A suite of reference genes were specifically recommended for each experimental condition. Among them, 28S, EF1A, and CypA were the best reference genes across different development stages; GAPDH, 28S, and CypA were most stable in different tissues. GAPDH and CypA were most stable in female and male adults and photoperiod conditions, 28S and EF1A were most stable under a range of temperatures, Actin and CypA were most stable under dietary RNAi condition. This work establishes a standardized RT-qPCR analysis in H. convergens. Additionally, this study lays a foundation for functional genomics research in H. convergens and sheds light on the ecological risk assessment of RNAi-based biopesticides on this non-target biological control agent.																	1932-6203					APR 27	2015	10	4							UNSP e0125868	10.1371/journal.pone.0125868								WOS:000353659100150	25915640					
J	Hiragaki, S; Suzuki, T; Mohamed, AAM; Takeda, M				Hiragaki, Susumu; Suzuki, Takeshi; Mohamed, Ahmed A. M.; Takeda, Makio			Structures and functions of insect arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (iaaNAT); a key enzyme for physiological and behavioral switch in arthropods	FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY												The evolution of N-acetyltransfeases (NATs) seems complex. Vertebrate arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (aaNAT) has been extensively studied since it leads to the synthesis of melatonin, a multifunctional neurohormone prevalent in photoreceptor cells, and is known as a chemical token of the night. Melatonin also serves as a scavenger for reactive oxygen species. This is also true with invertebrates. NAT therefore has distinct functional implications in circadian function, as timezymes (aaNAT), and also xenobiotic reactions (arylamine NAT or simply NAT). NATs belong to a broader enzyme group, the GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase superfamily. Due to low sequence homology and a seemingly fast rate of structural differentiation, the nomenclature for NATs can be confusing. The advent of bioinformatics, however, has helped to classify this group of enzymes; vertebrates have two distinct subgroups, the timezyme type and the xenobiotic type, which has a wider substrate range including imidazolamine, pharmacological drugs, environmental toxicants and even histone. Insect aaNAT (iaaNAT) form their own clade in the phylogeny, distinct from vertebrate aaNATs. Arthropods are unique, since the phylum has exoskeleton in which quinones derived from N-acetylated monoamines function in coupling chitin and arthropodins. Monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity is limited in insects, but NAT-mediated degradation prevails. However, unexpectedly iaaNAT occurs not only among arthropods but also among basal deuterostomia, and is therefore more apomorphic. Our analyses illustrate that iaaNATs has unique physiological roles but at the same time it plays a role in a timezyme function, at least in photoperiodism. Photoperiodism has been considered as a function of circadian system but the detailed molecular mechanism is not well understood. We propose a molecular hypothesis for photoperiodism in Antheraea pemyi based on the transcription regulation of NAT interlocked by the circadian system. Therefore, the enzyme plays both unique and universal roles in insects. The unique role of iaaNATs in physiological regulation urges the targeting of this system for integrated pest management (IPM). We indeed showed a successful example of chemical compound screening with reconstituted enzyme and further attempts seem promising.

Ooencyrtus pityocampae (OP), an important egg parasitoid of the pine processionary moth (PPM), is considered a generalist parasitoid. OP emerges from PPM eggs after winter hibernation, mainly in spring and early summer, long before the eggs of the next PPM generation occurs. The occurrence of OP in eggs of the variegated caper bug (CB) Stenozygum coloratum in spring and summer suggests that OP populations alternate seasonally between PPM and CB. However, the identity of OP population on CB eggs seemed uncertain; unlike OP-PPM populations, the former displayed apparently high male/female ratios and lack of attraction to the PPM sex pheromone. We studied the molecular identities of the two populations since the morphological identification of the genus Ooencyrtus, and OP in particular, is difficult. Sequencing of COI and ITS2 DNA fragments and AFLP analysis of individuals from both hosts revealed no apparent differences between the OP-PPM and the OP-CB populations for both the Israeli and the Turkish OPs, which therefore supported the possibility of host alternation. Sequencing data extended our knowledge of the genetic structure of OP populations in the Mediterranean area, and revealed clear separation between East and West Mediterranean populations. The overall level of genetic diversity was rather small, with the Israeli population much less diverse than all others; possible explanations for this finding are discussed. The findings support the possibility of utilizing the CB and other hosts for enhancing biological control of the PPM.

Global Transcriptional Dynamics of Diapause Induction in Non-Blood-Fed and Blood-Fed Aedes albopictus	PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES												Background Aedes albopictus is a vector of increasing public health concern due to its rapid global range expansion and ability to transmit Dengue virus, Chikungunya virus and a wide range of additional arboviruses. Traditional vector control strategies have been largely ineffective against Ae. albopictus and novel approaches are urgently needed. Photoperiodic diapause is a crucial ecological adaptation in a wide range of temperate insects. Therefore, targeting the molecular regulation of photoperiodic diapause or diapause-associated physiological processes could provide the basis of novel approaches to vector control. Methodology/Principal Findings We investigated the global transcriptional profiles of diapause induction in Ae. albopictus by performing paired-end RNA-Seq of biologically replicated libraries. We sequenced RNA from whole bodies of adult females reared under diapause-inducing and non-diapause-inducing photoperiods either with or without a blood meal. We constructed a comprehensive transcriptome assembly that incorporated previous assemblies and represents over 14,000 annotated dipteran gene models. Mapping of sequence reads to the transcriptome identified differential expression of 2,251 genes in response to diapause-inducing short-day photoperiods. In non-blood-fed females, potential regulatory elements of diapause induction were transcriptionally up-regulated, including two of the canonical circadian clock genes, timeless and cryptochrome 1. In blood-fed females, genes in metabolic pathways related to energy production and offspring provisioning were differentially expressed under diapause-inducing conditions, including the oxidative phosphorylation pathway and lipid metabolism genes. Conclusions/Significance This study is the first to utilize powerful RNA-Seq technologies to elucidate the transcriptional basis of diapause induction in any insect. We identified candidate genes and pathways regulating diapause induction, including a conserved set of genes that are differentially expressed as part of the diapause program in a diverse group of insects. These genes provide candidates whose diapause-associated function can be further interrogated using functional genomics approaches in Ae. albopictus and other insects.

INSIGHTS FROM AN INTEGRATED VIEW OF THE BIOLOGY OF APPLE SNAILS (CAENOGASTROPODA: AMPULLARIIDAE)	MALACOLOGIA												Apple snails (Ampullariidae) are among the largest and most ecologically important freshwater snails. The introduction of multiple species has reinvigorated the field and spurred a burgeoning body of research since the early 1990s, particularly regarding two species introduced to Asian wetlands and elsewhere, where they have become serious agricultural pests. This review places these recent advances in the context of previous work, across diverse fields ranging from phylogenetics and biogeography through ecology and developmental biology, and the more applied areas of environmental health and human disease. The review does not deal with the role of ampullariids as pests, nor their control and management, as this has been substantially reviewed elsewhere. Despite this large and diverse body of research, significant gaps in knowledge of these important snails remain, particularly in a comparative framework. The great majority of the work to date concerns a single species, Pomacea canaliculata, which we see as having the potential to become a model organism in a wide range of fields.

With the rapid advances in genomic technologies, many questions, seemingly intractable two decades ago, can be addressed, and ampullariids will provide valuable insights to our understanding across diverse fields in integrative biology.

A cross-seasonal perspective on local adaptation: metabolic plasticity mediates responses to winter in a thermal-generalist moth	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												The physiological and ecological impact of the thermal environment across life stages can result in trade-offs that determine fitness and population dynamics. Understanding mechanisms and consequences of local adaptation for any organism that overwinters requires taking a cross-seasonal perspective. We used a trait-based approach to distinguish variation among ecotypes in ecological and physiological responses to overwintering conditions. We used fall webworms (Hyphantria cunea; Lepidoptera: Arctiidae) from Ottawa, Ontario and Columbus Ohio, representing the centre and periphery of the native range. We hypothesized that populations would be locally adapted to their overwintering environments, with fitness maximized under natal overwintering conditions. We predicted that this local adaptation would result from modulation of rates of energy use, growth and development. Each ecotype had higher overwinter survival in their natal compared with non-natal winter environment, and this was associated with larger pupal mass, size and carbohydrate reserves at the end of winter. This suggests that the ecotypes are locally adapted to winter conditions. Larger adults laid more eggs, but there was no effect of ecotype or environment on fecundity. Pupae overwintering at warm, energetically demanding, southern temperatures suppressed metabolic rates in autumn, and developed more quickly in the spring, compensating for energetic demands of warmer winters. Northern ecotypes had lower thermal sensitivity of metabolism, leading to higher metabolic rates at cool temperatures that correlated with faster post-winter development. Local adaptation to winter conditions suggests performance of peripheral populations may not be enhanced by warming winters. Decoupling of winter and growing season temperatures may negatively impact ectotherms.

Adult activity and temperature preference drives region-wide damselfly (Zygoptera) distributions under a warming climate	BIOLOGY LETTERS												We analysed a recently completed statewide odonate Atlas using multi-variate linear models. Within a phylogenetically explicit framework, we developed a suite of data-derived traits to assess the mechanistic distributional drivers of 59 species of damselflies in New York State (NYS). We found that length of the flight season (adult breeding activity period) mediated by thermal preference drives regional distributions at broad (10(5) km(2)) scales. Species that had longer adult flight periods, in conjunction with longer growing seasons, had significantly wider distributions. These intrinsic traits shape species' responses to changing climates and the mechanisms behind such range shifts are fitness-based metapopulation processes that adjust phenology to the prevailing habitat and climate regime through a photoperiod filter.																	1744-9561	1744-957X				APR 1	2015	11	4							UNSP 20150001	10.1098/rsbl.2015.0001								WOS:000353349400008	25878048

In this study, we combined field observations from three European countries with breeding experiments under field conditions to identify oviposition and larval preferences of Coenonympha oedippus at the micro-scale level across contrasting habitat types (wet vs. dry). Despite the wide geographical range and the different habitats we found some common features: (1) vegetation structure of the herb layer is an essential factor for oviposition site electivity and successful development of premature stages; (2) high cover of litter and/or dwarf shrubs in the microhabitat (larval 45-70 %, oviposition 40-50 %) creates a herb layer rich in gaps; at their edges eggs are deposited and the caterpillars are adequately sun-exposed; (3) egg-laying females are not selective regarding oviposition substratum; (4) oviposition height is adjusted to positions with direct sunlight or warm substratum; (5) the host-plants coverage in oviposition sites was high: between 45 and 50 % in wet habitats, and between 18 and 41 % in dry habitats (depending on whether only plants observed as hosts in this study are counted, or whether all potential host species are included); (6) the most important host-plant is Carex panicea (wet) and Carex humilis (dry), but Molinia caerulea (wet) and Festuca rupicola (dry) are also used regularly; (7) the availability of winter-green host-plants in the vicinity of hibernated larvae plays a substantial role in their survival. As regular mowing or grazing would remove the litter and destroy the gaps, the management should be restricted to selective reed cutting or manual shrub removal. Only selective mowing during winter (December-February) can be recommended for keeping the habitat open where the reduction of bushes is not sufficient.

The timing of recurrent life history events (phenology) is under strong selection, but the study of the genes that control potential environmental canalization in phenological traits is at its infancy. Candidate genes for circadian behaviour entrained by photoperiod have been screened as potential controllers of phenological variation of breeding and moult in birds, with inconsistent results. Despite photoperiodic control of migration is well established, no study has reported on migration phenology in relation to polymorphism at candidate genes in birds. We analysed variation in spring migration dates within four trans-Saharan migratory species (Luscinia megarhynchos; Ficedula hypoleuca; Anthus trivialis; Saxicola rubetra) at a Mediterranean island in relation to Clock and Adcyap1 polymorphism. Individuals with larger number of glutamine residues in the poly-Q region of Clock gene migrated significantly later in one or, respectively, two species depending on sex and whether the within-individual mean length or the length of the longer Clock allele was considered. The results hinted at dominance of the longer Clock allele. No significant evidence for migration date to covary with Adcyap1 polymorphism emerged. This is the first evidence that migration phenology is associated with Clock in birds. This finding is important for evolutionary studies of migration and sheds light on the mechanisms that drive bird phenological changes and population trends in response to climate change.

Increased exposure to light at night (LAN) is common in modern life, and LAN exposure is the most important environmental cue for circadian misalignment. However, the association between LAN exposure and atherosclerosis has never been explored in humans. In this cross-sectional study, we measured nighttime light intensity in the bedroom along with the intima-media thickness (IMT) of the common carotid artery using ultrasonography in 700 elderly individuals (mean age 71.6 years). Averages of mean and maximal carotid IMT were 0.88 +/- 0.15mm and 1.09 +/- 0.32 mm, respectively. Median intensity of LAN exposure was 0.74 lux (interquartile range, 0.08-3.34). Both mean and maximal carotid IMT significantly increased across quartiles of increasing LAN intensity (p for trend = 0.002 and <0.001, respectively). After adjustment for confounding factors, including age, gender, body mass index, current smoking status, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, sleep medication, estimated glomerular filtration rate, nocturia, bedtime, duration in bed (scotoperiod), day length (photoperiod), urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin excretion and daytime and nighttime physical activity, multivariate linear regression models revealed significant associations of LAN exposure with carotid IMT measurements [mean: beta, 0.032 (fourth versus first quartiles); 95% confidence intervals (CI), 0.002-0.061; p = 0.037; maximal: beta, 0.100 (fourth versus first quartiles); 95% CI, 0.034-0.165; p = 0.003]. In conclusion, these results suggested that LAN exposure in home settings is significantly associated with subclinical carotid atherosclerosis in the general elderly population.																	0742-0528	1525-6073				APR	2015	32	3					310	317		10.3109/07420528.2014.974809								WOS:000351833600002	25357212

ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												White-nose syndrome (WNS) is an emerging infectious disease that has resulted in severe declines of its hibernating bat hosts in North America. The ongoing epidemic of white-nose syndrome is a multi-scale phenomenon because it causes hibernaculum-level extirpations, while simultaneously spreading over larger spatial scales. We investigate a neglected topic in ecological epidemiology: how local pathogen-driven extirpations impact large-scale pathogen spread. Previous studies have identified risk factors for propagation of WNS over hibernaculum and landscape scales but none of these have tested the hypothesis that separation of spatial scales and disease-induced mortality at the hibernaculum level might slow or halt its spread. To test this hypothesis, we developed a mechanistic multi-scale model parameterized using white-nose syndrome county and site incidence data that connects hibernaculum-level susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) epidemiology to the county-scale contagion process. Our key result is that hibernaculum-level extirpations will not inhibit county-scale spread of WNS. We show that over 80% of counties of the contiguous USA are likely to become infected before the current epidemic is over and that geometry of habitat connectivity is such that host refuges are exceedingly rare. The macroscale spatiotemporal infection pattern that emerges from local SIR epidemiological processes falls within a narrow spectrum of possible outcomes, suggesting that recolonization, rescue effects, and multi-host complexities at local scales are not important to forward propagation of WNS at large spatial scales. If effective control measures are not implemented, precipitous declines in bat populations are likely, particularly in cave-dense regions that constitute the main geographic corridors of the USA, a serious concern for bat conservation.

In this study, we investigated seven populations of swallowtail Sericinus montelus Gray, 1798 (Lepidoptera: Papilionidae), a non-migratory species, to explore the latitudinal variation of morphological characteristics in adults. The results showed that body size and the development of dark pigmentation on wings in this species responded strongly to latitude. The body size of both male and female adult of S.montelus was negatively correlated with latitude. These findings provided solid evidence to support the converse Bergmann's rule. We considered that the observed variation in morphological characteristics was most likely mediated by the seasonal length and thermoperiod to adapt to different latitudinal environment (e.g. shortened developmental time of immature stages for smaller body size at higher latitude). Moreover, the tendency towards progressively darker colour patterns (only in adult males) at increasingly low latitudes was consistent with Gloger's rule. We suggested that the observed colour variation was most likely associated with thermoregulation. Slight variation in the morphology of the W-shaped stripe on the forewing of adult females was also found, and we presumed that the functions of sexual preferences, mimicry and thermoregulation might be involved.																	0001-7272	1463-6395				APR	2015	96	2					242	252		10.1111/azo.12072								WOS:000351163700014

Temperature affects long-term productivity and quality attributes of day-neutral strawberry for a space life-support system	LIFE SCIENCES IN SPACE RESEARCH												Strawberry (Fragaria x ananassaL.) is a promising candidate crop for space life-support systems with desirable sensory quality and health attributes. Day-neutral cultivars such as 'Seascape' are adaptable to a range of photoperiods, including short days that would save considerable energy for crop lighting without reductions in productivity or yield. Since photoperiod and temperature interact to affect strawberry growth and development, several diurnal temperature regimes were tested under a short photoperiod of 10 h per day for effects on yield and quality attributes of 'Seascape' strawberry during production cycles longer than 270 days. The coolest day/night temperature regime, 16 degrees/8 degrees C, tended to produce smaller numbers of larger fruit than did the intermediate temperature range of 18 degrees/10 degrees C or the warmest regime, 20 degrees/12 degrees C, both of which produced similar larger numbers of smaller fruit. The intermediate temperature regime produced the highest total fresh mass of berries over an entire production cycle. Independent experiments examined either organoleptic or physicochemical quality attributes. Organoleptic evaluation indicated that fruit grown under the coolest temperature regime tended to score the highest for both hedonic preference and descriptive evaluation of sensory attributes related to sweetness, texture, aftertaste, and overall approval. The physicochemical quality attributes Brix, pH, and sugar/acid ratio were highest for fruits harvested from the coolest temperature regime and lower for those from the warmer temperature regimes. The cool-regime fruits also were lowest in titratable acidity. The yield parameters fruit number and size oscillated over the course of a production cycle, with a gradual decline in fruit size under all three temperature regimes. Brix and titratable acidity both decreased over time for all three temperature treatments, but sugar/acid ratio remained highest for the cool temperature regime over the entire production period. Periodic rejuvenation or replacement of strawberry propagules may be needed to maintain both quality and quantity of strawberry yield in space.

J	Jankowski, KS				Jankowski, Konrad S.			Is the shift in chronotype associated with an alteration in well-being?	BIOLOGICAL RHYTHM RESEARCH												The study aimed to test whether a shift in chronotype (determined by mid-sleep on free days) is associated with alterations in psychological well-being and sleep parameters. One hundred and seventeen undergraduates were tested in longitudinal study with four repeated measures. Measurements were taken during spring in three-week intervals and each measurement consisted of self-reported sleep parameters on work and free days (i.e. bedtime, sleep latency, wake time, sleep onset, mid-sleep time, social jetlag), satisfaction with life, and mood (energetic arousal, tense arousal, hedonic tone). Between-subjects analyses revealed earlier chronotypes, as compared to the later ones, showing lower tense arousal, higher energetic arousal and life satisfaction, earlier bedtime, sleep onset and offset on both work and free days, longer sleep duration and shorter sleep latency on workdays, and less social jetlag. Within-subjects analyses revealed increasing photoperiod associated with a shift toward earlier chronotype, decrease in social jetlag, and shortening sleep latency. The seasonal shift toward earlier chronotype was not associated with alterations in mood or life satisfaction, but it was associated with a shift toward earlier bedtimes and longer sleep duration on workdays, decrease in sleep latency, and social jetlag. Results from the within-subjects analyses were consistent with the results of between-subjects analyses regarding sleep-wake functioning, but inconsistent regarding psychological outcomes.

Demographic Analyses of Resistance of Five Varieties of Date Palm, Phoenix dactylifera L. to Ommatissus lybicus De Bergevin (Hemiptera: Tropiduchidae)	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Demographic analyses of dubas bug, Ommatissus lybicus de Bergevin, (Hemiptera: Tropiduchidae), reared on five date palm varieties (Zahdi, Mazafati, Piarom, Khasi, and Shahani) were constructed under laboratory conditions at 27 +/- 1 degrees C, 70 +/- 5% RH, and a 14:10 hours (L: D) photoperiod. Data were analyzed based on the age-stage, two-sex life table theory to take the variable developmental rate among individuals and both sexes into consideration. Results showed that different varieties of date palm influenced development time and fecundity of dubas bug. The total pre-adult developmental time was the shortest on Zahdi (85.21 days) and the longest on Khasi (88.39 days). The longevities of both male and female adults on different varieties were significantly different. The mean fecundity per female was significantly higher on Zahdi (78.62 eggs) and Mazafati (68 eggs) than on Shahani (43.53 eggs) and Khasi (46.32 eggs). The highest and lowest net reproductive rates were obtained on Zahdi (40.58 offspring per individual) and Shahani (16.88 offspring per individual), respectively. The intrinsic rates of increase were 0.0401, 0.0368, 0.0355, 0.0312 and 0.0301 per day on Zahdi, Piarom, Mazafati, Khasi and Shahani, respectively. The mean generation times ranged from 92.78 days reared on Zahdi to 95.25 days on Mazafati. According to results obtained in this study, Shahani and Khasi were the most resistant varieties while Zahdi was the most susceptible variety to dubas bug among the varieties tested.																	1680-7073					MAR-APR	2015	17	2					263	273										WOS:000354947900001

Bivoltinism in Coenagrion mercuriale (Zygoptera: Odonata) in the southern margin of its distribution range: emergence pattern and larval growth	AFRICAN ENTOMOLOGY												Voltinism is an important life history trait that varies with the environment. In temperate zones, insect populations take a substantially longer time to reach the adult stage in the northern compared to the southern regions. In this study, emergence pattern and larval growth of the threatened zygopteran (Odonata) Coenagrion mercuriale were investigated in a population located in the southern limit of its distribution range in order to determine its life history strategies in a hot climate and compare them to those displayed in northern populations. There was no apparent winter diapause. The species produced two generations in a year, with the first generation emerging in mid spring and the second in late summer. The emergence pattern of the first generation was typical of a summer species and lasted 48 days. All larvae emerged by the end of May. Due to some environmental perturbations, the emergence pattern of the second generation was not surveyed, but there was evidence that the emergence season was short (21 days). Larval structure prior to the second emergence of the year showed that only 25% of the population was in the final instar, which explains the shorter emergence season. We assume that the first eggs laid in the spring hatch and grow rapidly to reach the final instar in late summer as a consequence of higher temperatures and potential high food availability. There was a significant seasonal decline in body size in both males and females. The second generation had a significantly smaller body size, presumably due to the short growth season and/or higher growth rate.																	1021-3589	1026-4914				MAR	2015	23	1					59	67		10.4001/003.023.0120								WOS:000352478600006

Behavioral and physiological responses of American black bears to landscape features within an agricultural region	ECOSPHERE												Human activities and variation in habitat quality and configuration have been shown to influence space use patterns in many species, but few studies have documented the physiological responses of free-ranging animals to these factors. We combined remote biologger technology, capturing continuous heart rate values, with locational data from GPS collars to investigate the behavioral and physiological reactions of American black bears (Ursus americanus) to a landscape dominated by agriculture (52.5% areal cover). Our study occurred at the edge of the range of this species, with small, scattered patches of forest within a mosaic of crop fields and an extensive road network. However, only; similar to 2-4% of the area contained crops that bears consumed (corn, sunflowers, oats). We used GPS locations to identify the habitat that bears occupied, and to estimate their rates of travel. Heart rates increased with movement rates, rising by over 30% from resting rate to their fastest travel speeds. We used a modeling approach to distinguish among factors that influenced heart rates independent of movement rates. Bears commonly crossed agricultural areas that provided no food or cover and their heart rates, elevated beyond what was expected from their movement rate, were indicative of a stress response. However, when bears entered agricultural areas composed of edible crops, many individuals showed reduced movement and slower heart rates, suggesting that bears foraging there felt at ease or crops allow bears to more easily forage due to their dense spatial arrangements. Unexpectedly, female bears elicited lower heart rates and lower levels of activity in the most fragmented patches of natural habitat, possibly a sign of human-avoidance behavior or a reaction related to crossing roads. During fall, as bears prepared for hibernation, their heart rates declined two weeks before their movements slackened, evidence that metabolism slowed to enhance fat accumulation; they also shifted to a nocturnal activity pattern, likely to reduce exertion during the heat of the day. The use of a physiological monitor provided new insights on bear biology and ecology that would not have otherwise been apparent.

Spatial Ecology of Northern Pinesnakes (Pituophis m. melanoleucus) in Disturbed and Undisturbed Habitats in the New Jersey Pine Barrens	HERPETOLOGICA												The decline in snake populations has been attributed primarily to anthropogenic disturbances, including habitat destruction and fragmentation. We radio-tracked Northern Pinesnakes (Pituophis m. melanoleucus) in a military Target Zone and in the surrounding undisturbed buffer zone at the Warren Grove Gunnery Range in the New Jersey Pine Barrens, USA, to examine differences in spatial movement patterns and behavior. There were no differences in home range size ((X) over bar = 60.0 +/- 32.7 ha), core activity area ((X) over bar = 10.6 +/- 8.2 ha), range length ((X) over bar = 1294.8 +/- 32.7 m), or mean distance traveled per day ((X) over bar = 65.2 +/- 30.1 m) across all snakes, or between sexes (male n = 13, female n = 11), or location within (n = 13) or outside (n = 11) of the Target Zone. However, there were differences between tracking years. Northern Pinesnakes in 2005 and 2006 (n = 13) traveled greater total distance and mean distance per day and had larger home ranges compared to snakes radio-tracked in 2003 and 2004 (n = 11). In 2005 and 2006, snakes in the Target Zone traveled longer distances compared to snakes outside the Target Zone. Pinesnakes used both the Target Zone and undisturbed buffer zone for mating, nesting, foraging, and hibernating. Although the Target Zone was disturbed regularly, the open-canopied landscape, cover availability, and sandy soils maintained habitat for Northern Pinesnakes. Our data indicate that the military disturbance had little impact on the spatial ecology of Northern Pinesnakes; the disturbed area supported enough natural habitat features used by Northern Pinesnakes and was surrounded by a large tract of undisturbed landscape. These data can aid in developing mitigation and conservation strategies where the habitat of Northern Pinesnakes is threatened by development, in particular, across other military installations, which commonly overlap with the occurance of Northern Pinesnakes.																	0018-0831	1938-5099				MAR	2015	71	1					19	25		10.1655/HERPETOLOGICA-D-13-00028								WOS:000352093900004

We discovered 22 different winter hibernacula that were used by 39 Northern Pinesnakes. Of the 10 snakes monitored in hibernacula for 3-5 yr, shifting was observed by 8 individuals, and 2 females showed hibernacula philopatry for five consecutive years. The average minimum convex polygon home range of 14 radio-tracked Northern Pinesnakes was 105.51 ha (located 30-108 times/snake), whereas the average kernel density estimator home range was 50% isopleth = 38.99 ha and 90% isopleth = 133.15 ha. There were no differences in home range as a function of sex, but the number of years snakes were radio-tracked affected home range size. An adult male had the largest home range of 258 ha. The average distance traveled by radio-tracked Northern Pinesnakes from their winter hibernacula was 1321.05 m, with a maximum distance of 2146.91 m. Of all snakes followed, 27.3% (n = 3) traveled <1000 m, 18.2% (n = 2) traveled 1000-1100 m, 18.2% (n = 2) traveled 1100-1200 m, and 36.4% (n = 4) traveled >1200 m. The average number of hibernacula available per home range was 3.2. Snakes that were monitored for >= 2 yr had larger home ranges than snakes that were only radio-tracked for 1 yr. Thus, radio-tracking several adult snakes over a 3-5-yr period is the most effective method to determine home ranges, locate hibernacula sites of meta-populations, and reveal an understanding of their ecology, behavior, and conservation requirements.																	0018-0831	1938-5099				MAR	2015	71	1					26	36		10.1655/HERPETOLOGICA-D-13-00035								WOS:000352093900005

While sodium hypochlorite solutions (NaOCl) have long been recognized as ovicides for use against dengue vectors, the susceptibility of eggs to spray applications has not been robustly evaluated on substrate materials representative of the most frequently utilized artificial container habitats. Experiments were performed under controlled and natural conditions by applying dilutions of household bleach (52.5 ppt NaOCl) as a spray to eggs on plastic, rubber, and concrete surfaces, with and without a smectite clay thickener. Laboratory assays identified the minimum NaOCl concentrations required to eliminate eggs on plastic (10 ppt), rubber (20 ppt) and concrete (20 ppt) surfaces. Addition of smectite clay reduced the minimum effective concentration to 10 ppt NaOCl for all 3 substrates. A minimum exposure period of 24 h was required to completely eliminate egg viability on concrete surfaces, even at the highest NaOCl concentration (52.5 ppt). Field experiments verified that spray application of a 1:3 dilution of household bleach mixed with smectite clay can reduce egg hatching by >= 99% in shaded and sun-exposed plastic containers. Similarly, 4:1 dilution of household bleach (with or without smectite clay) eliminated a >= 98% of eggs from concrete surfaces in outdoor, water-filled drums. In this study, we propose a practical, effective and safe strategy for using household bleach to eliminate Ae. aegypti eggs in a range of artificial container habitats.																	8756-971X	1943-6270				MAR	2015	31	1					77	84		10.2987/14-6427R.1								WOS:000351326700010	25843179					
J	Lind, L; Nilsson, C				Lind, Lovisa; Nilsson, Christer			Vegetation patterns in small boreal streams relate to ice and winter floods	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												In-stream and riparian vegetation are species rich, productive and dynamic. Their patterns in small boreal streams are largely driven by seasonal flow regimes. Traditionally, flow-related processes during the growing season, particularly the spring flood, have been seen as the most important, whereas vegetation has been viewed as being dormant and less affected' during winter. Riparian and in-stream vegetation were inventoried during the summers 2011-2013 in eight reaches of northern Swedish streams. Along each reach, the ice formation was surveyed during winter by visual inspections and with permanently placed cameras. We then evaluated the potential effects of ice regimes and winter flooding on riparian and in-stream vegetation during 3years by relating the abundance of winter floods caused by anchor ice to the cover, composition and biomass of vegetation. We found that the numbers of winter floods were higher along reaches with anchor-ice formation than in reaches without. We also found that species diversity of riparian vegetation was higher in the reaches with anchor ice. This resulted from a lower cover of riparian dwarf shrubs and a higher cover of graminoids and forbs along reaches with anchor ice. We also found a lower cover of in-stream algae but a higher cover of bryophytes in anchor-ice reaches. These patterns were consistent throughout the study period although there were interannual differences in temperature, water levels and ice cover. During our study period, we encountered an average of 20 shifts per winter between freezing and thawing, while there was an average of 10 shifts per winter during 1960-1990. This indicates a warming climate in high latitudes. Higher temperatures and more shifts between freezing and thawing may initially increase ice dynamics. However, with further increases in mean temperature, ice production should eventually decrease.Synthesis. Ice and winter floods caused by anchor ice appear to be important disturbance agents that allow less competitive species to establish along small boreal streams. If ice dynamics is reduced, the composition and production of riparian and in-stream vegetation may be changed, with possible consequences for the entire stream ecosystem.																	0022-0477	1365-2745				MAR	2015	103	2					431	440		10.1111/1365-2745.12355								WOS:000350549000014

As photoperiod correlates with latitude, range expansions in seasonal environments may require re-synchronization of phenology and life-history traits with novel season length. Adaptive resynchronization takes time, and hence might be one factor explaining why range expansion to higher latitudes often is slow. Studies investigating latitudinal clines in photoperiodic traits often focus on species or populations which are well established. However, studying organisms which are in the process of expanding their range can provide valuable information on the evolutionary ecological mechanisms driving the adaptive synchronization to seasonal environments. The Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, is a pest of potato, which rapidly has spread towards higher latitudes. We studied whether beetles from six European populations along a latitudinal axis are synchronized with their local photoperiodic environmental conditions. Variation in critical photoperiod (when 50 % of individuals make the decision to overwinter), diapause incidence, burrowing age for diapause and resurfacing behaviour were investigated by maintaining beetles under six photoperiods. The beetles showed a clear latitudinal pattern in diapause incidence and burrowing age for diapause but not in critical photoperiod. Resurfacing behaviour of burrowed beetles increased with the length of the photoperiod, which through unsynchronized overwintering behaviour could lead to high overwintering mortality. Thus, while synchronization of diapause preparation with local photoperiodic conditions can be one reason explaining the success of L. decemlineata in expanding to higher latitudes, further northward range expansion could be constrained by inherent difficulties to initiate overwintering under very long photoperiods.

J	Estiarte, M; Penuelas, J				Estiarte, Marc; Penuelas, Josep			Alteration of the phenology of leaf senescence and fall in winter deciduous species by climate change: effects on nutrient proficiency	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Leaf senescence in winter deciduous species signals the transition from the active to the dormant stage. The purpose of leaf senescence is the recovery of nutrients before the leaves fall. Photoperiod and temperature are the main cues controlling leaf senescence in winter deciduous species, with water stress imposing an additional influence. Photoperiod exerts a strict control on leaf senescence at latitudes where winters are severe and temperature gains importance in the regulation as winters become less severe. On average, climatic warming will delay and drought will advance leaf senescence, but at varying degrees depending on the species. Warming and drought thus have opposite effects on the phenology of leaf senescence, and the impact of climate change will therefore depend on the relative importance of each factor in specific regions. Warming is not expected to have a strong impact on nutrient proficiency although a slower speed of leaf senescence induced by warming could facilitate a more efficient nutrient resorption. Nutrient resorption is less efficient when the leaves senesce prematurely as a consequence of water stress. The overall effects of climate change on nutrient resorption will depend on the contrasting effects of warming and drought. Changes in nutrient resorption and proficiency will impact production in the following year, at least in early spring, because the construction of new foliage relies almost exclusively on nutrients resorbed from foliage during the preceding leaf fall. Changes in the phenology of leaf senescence will thus impact carbon uptake, but also ecosystem nutrient cycling, especially if the changes are consequence of water stress.

J	Haugen, IMA; Gotthard, K				Haugen, Inger M. Aalberg; Gotthard, Karl			Diapause induction and relaxed selection on alternative developmental pathways in a butterfly	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												1. Seasonal phenotypic plasticity entails differential trait expression depending on the time of season. The facultative induction of winter diapause in temperate insects is a developmental switch mechanism often leading to differential expression in life-history traits. However, when there is a latitudinal shift from a bivoltine to univoltine life cycle, selection for pathway-specific expression is disrupted, which may allow drift towards less optimal trait values within the non-selected pathway. We use field- and experimental data from five Swedish populations of Pararge aegeria to investigate latitudinal variation in voltinism, local adaptation in the diapause switch and footprints of selection on pathway-specific regulation of life-history traits and sexual dimorphism in larval development. Field data clearly illustrated how natural populations gradually shift from bivoltinism to univoltinism as latitude increases. This was supported experimentally as the decrease in direct development at higher latitudes was accompanied by increasing critical daylengths, suggesting local adaptation in the diapause switch. The differential expression among developmental pathways in development time and growth rate was significantly less pronounced in univoltine populations. Univoltine populations showed no significant signs of protandry during larval development, suggesting that erosion of the direct development pathway under relaxed selection has led to the loss of its sex-specific modifications.
