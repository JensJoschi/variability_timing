# Aim
This folder lists publications that studied photoperiodic response curves of insects at multiple locations. The photoperiodic response curves are extracted from the papers, and the slopes of the curves are calculated. These slopes will later be correlated to variability in winter onset. 



#Folder contents

*the subfolder "00raw" contains search results from web of science, and the main figures for each study. 
* The subfolder "01 extracted_data" contains x and y coordinates of all points within the figures. 
* Subfolder "02output" processes the data and calculates the slopes of the curves from all figures.
