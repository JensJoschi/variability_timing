# Introduction  

Timing is an important component of ecology. Diurnal and seasonal timing regulate individual fitness (Vaze & Sharma, 2013), interactions among individuals  (Poesel et al., 2006; Greives et al., 2015) species interactions (Wier et al., 2010; Ximenez-Embun et al., 2014; Martinez-Bakker & Helm, 2015; Mahendiran, 2016) and biogeography (Anderson & Walter, 2005; Dunbar & Shi, 2012). Being such an important trait, a whole research field (chronobiology) is dedicated to timing mechanisms. The field is traditionally multidisciplinary, and while many experiments are directed at physiology, there are close ties to ecology and evolution  (Marques & Waterhouse, 2004; Kronfeld-Schor et al., 2013). Despite being a great source of data with ecological relevance, ecolgists have been reluctant to incorporate chronobiological aspects, possibly due to the differences in terms and methodology (Visser et al., 2010). For example, many chronobiological studies envision timing as a trait that has a single optimum, and deviations from this optimum are regarded as maladaptive noise. This is in contrast to typical ecological approaches which attempt to explain individual variance by various ecological factors. The field of chronobiology has recently progressed to incorporate the adaptive value of individual heterogeneity and plasticity, and this shift in paradigms provides plenty of opportunitiest to refine the views on classically ecological questions (Helm et al., 2017). Nevertheless, the vast resources of chronobiological data remain nearly untapped.  	

Biological timekeeping is mostly about coping with the cyclically changing environment  (though further reasons for timekeeping exist, e.g. compass orientation and task partitioning; Paranjpe & Kumar Sharma, 2005), and hence tightly related to the ability of organisms ro react to change.  It is therefore not surprising that various forms of phenotypic plasticity (entrainment, masking) are key concepts in research on timing (Moore-Ede). Plasticity is clearly an important strategy to cope with change that is not on the scale of microevolutionary responses (Gienapp et al., 2008), but it is not the only mechanism to deal with environmental variability (Scheiner, interactions with dev instab.). A key limitation of phenotpyic plasticity is that it requires predictions about the environment, i.e. a tight correlation of an environmental signal and environmental change (Scheiner, 1993). This important limitation of plasticity has so far not been reckognized in chronobiology , because astronomical cycles are thought to provide reliable information about the change in environmental conditions.   

While diurnal change of day and night or the seasonal change in day length is indeed stable and perfectly predictable, other abiotic factors such as humidity and temperature are less strongly correlated to the astronomical cycles. This causes some fitness-relevant traits such as timing of first frost to vary between years with little predictability. Under such conditions with high fitness variance the best strategy to increase long-term (geometric mean) fitness is not necessarily the one that yields the highest arithmetic mean fitness, but may be one that minimizes the variance term (Starrfelt & Kokko, 2012) (Cohen, 1966). Strategies that reduce fitness variance at the cost of arithmetic mean fitness are called bet-hedging. Bet-hedgers may reduce between-years variance by either avoiding any risk (conservative bet-hedging), or by spreading the risk among the offspring and investing in a range of phenotypes (diversified bet-hedging). 

Phenotypic plasticity and bet-hedging complement each other, because environments are generally neither perfectly predictable, nor perfectly unpredictable and an optimal strategy should strike a balance between plasticity and bet-hedging (Donaldson-Matasci et al., 2013; Grantham et al., 2016). Indeed, a mixed strategy of plasticity and bet-hedging can exist (Furness et al., 2015), and the two strategies may trade off against each other (Simons, 2014). We therefore hypothesized that among-individual variance in seasonal timing increases both with increasing variability and decreasing predictability of the environment. We adressed this question with a meta-analysis over a range of physiological studies on insect diapause. Multiple studies have recorded photoperiodic response curves (PRC) of insects along a latitudinal gradient, either to demonstrate the adaptive value of timing mechanisms (e.g. bradshaw) or to infer relations of circadian system and photoperiodism (e.g. veerman?). PRCs are reaction norms to photic cues, and usually follow a logit-function e.g. (Urbanski et al., 2012; Muona & Lumme, 2017) . There is a range of day lengths at which diapause is probabilistic among one mother’s offspring (Fig. 1A), and we argue that the slope of such a PRC acts as bet-hedging trait, because a flat slope allows mixing offspring types over a wider range of environmental conditions. Therefore variation in slope estimates among populations should be explained by variation in environmental variability and predictability.

1. climate data
Mean winter onset decreased sharply with latitude and altitude (Fig. 1A), while winter variability was highest between approximately 30 and 40°N (Fig 1B). Predictability (Fig 1C,D) was quite homogenous and varied only in  scandinavia and the western USA. Based on the timing of winter onset and on latitude one can calculate the optimal (arithmetic mean) timing of diapause (Fig. 2). The expected day length of diapause increased roughly exponentially with latitude, but was nearly linear between 30 and 60°N. 

2. Empirical data.
We identified 30 eligible studies with PRCs of 174 populations (Fig. 3). We extracted CDL estimates (Fig. 4 A) and slope estimates (Fig. 4B) along with their standard error.

3. Analysis
Critical photoperiod correlated with latittude (Fig. 5). 5 ° latitude changed the photoperiod by 49  minutes (CI 40.05 – 56.97 min ;pseudo-R² = 0.60). Heterogeneity was reasonable given the phylogenetic signal (I² = 58.37; contribution of order, genus and study[species] = 20.33, 18.53, 19.51). Critical photoperiod correlated even better with day length expected by latitude and winter onset (including a 1 month time lag between induction and expression) (pseudo-R² = 0.7). The slope of the PRCs, on the other hand, correlated neither with winter variability (pseudo-R² = -0.02, fig. 6A) nor with winter predictability (pseudo-R² = 0.01, fig. 6B). 

# Discussion (or rather, text blocks that could be included somewhere)
 Moreover, biological time-keeping is frequently not perfectly temperature-compensated (that is, time measuring depends partly on temperature; (Lamb & Pointing, 1972), so organisms can adapt their timing in warmer years.

The arrival of winter is variable and hence difficult to predict, which should favour bet-hedging responses (Halkett et al., 2004). I thus assume that the width of the range with random offspring determination, i.e. the slope of the photoperiodic response curve, can serve as bet-hedging trait to cope with variability in winter onset. Moreover, as the timing is partially adjusted via phenotypic plasticity, organisms in relatively predictable environments should have less need to rely on bet-hedging, and are expected to have a steeper slope regardless of environmental variability.  

Providing empirical evidence for bet-hedging is a challenge, as one would have to demonstrate that variability is not random noise but has long-term fitness consequences. One reasonably good line of evidence would be to demonstrate a covariation of environmental and physiological variability (Simons, 2011) across genotypes. We hence conducted a meta-analysis. First we derived photoperiodic response curves from 350 populations from over 60 published studies. Secondly, we calculated variability and predictability of winter onset, using a network of 30,000 climate stations. Thirdly, we correlated the slope of the PRCs with environmental variability and predictability.

It is therefore not surprising that the ability to track environmental change (called entrainment) is one of the three criteria that classically constitue the definition of a circadian rhythm (citation herexxx).  The ecological/evolutionary equivalent of this concept is phenotypic plasticity, the ability of one genotype to produce several phenotypes. Phenotypic plasticity is one of the strategies to cope with change that is not on the scale of microevolutionary responses (Gienapp et al., 2008), and it has important evolutionary consequences, as it drives long-term genotypic change (Price et al., 2003) and contributes to evolution and speciation (Bradshaw, 1965; Laland et al., 2015)()P . Plasticity may, however, be associated with significant costs and constrains (DeWitt et al., 1998; Murren et al., 2015). In particular, only predictable change that is correlated to a reliable signal can be tackled with phenotypic plasticity (Scheiner, 1993). This important limitation of plasticity has so far not been reckognized in chronobiology , because astronomical cycles are thought to provide reliable information about the change in environmental conditions.   
The relationship among bet-hedging and (partial) predictability can be illustrated by a refined view of a reaction norm (Fig. 1). A phenotypic reaction norm sees the phenotype as function of some environmental state.  In the easiest case of two discrete polyphenisms, the change in phenotypes can be approximated by a logit-curve. Actually, the environment is rarely sampled directly, so the reaction norm should be a (phenotype~cue) function, with a cue that is correlated to the environmental state.
An imperfect correlation of cue and environment is particularly problematic for logit-functions: If the position on the x-axis(environmental state) is not determined correctly, the phenotype is easily mismatched. Centering the logit-curve around the cue that is on average equal to  the environmental switch-point will yield the highest arithmetic mean fitness, but it ignores fitness variance (the phenotype will often be mismatched). In principle, there are two strategies to increase geometric mean fitness. First, one could rely on other cues to increase the correlation of the (compound) cue and the environment. This option may, however, not always be available. A second strategy to increase geometric mean fitness is to make the phenotype-cue curve less steep: Only a fraction of each phenotype is expressed along a larger range of environments, so at least some phenotypes will match with the environment. This increases the number of mismatched phenotypes and hence reduces arithmetic mean fitness, but also reduces fitness correlations among the offspring and thus may increase geometric mean fitness – We call this diversified bet-hedging. If the two environments are unequal (1 harsh, 1 good), it may also be an alternative to shift along the x-axis, so that the harsh-environment phenotype (e.g. diapausing stages or seed dormancy) occurs more often than it should on average. This reduces mean fitness but also fitness variance (conservative bet-hedging). Phrased like this, bet-hedging can be defined as the shape of the reaction norm.

B) fitness of organism with steep (black) and flat (red) slope in stable and fluctuating environments. All ofspring of the non-hedging (black) population have the same fitness, because they switch synchronously when environments change. This causes the line to go extinct when facing a “bad” year. The offspring of the bet-hedging lines differ in fitness, depending on the amount of mismatch with the environment. This causes lower fitness in stable environments, but also lower fitness variance in fluctuating conditions.

# alternative introduction

Organisms need to cope with heterogeneous and fluctuating environments. Being able to adapt flexibly to a range of environmental conditions is thus crucial for survival. Phenotypic plasticity, the ability of one genotype to produce several phenotypes, is the most prevalent mode of dealing with fluctuating conditions (Gienapp et al., 2008). 

Phenotypic plasticity drives long-term genotypic change (Price et al., 2003), contributes to evolution and speciation (Bradshaw, 1965; Laland et al., 2015) and buffers organisms against environmental change (Charmantier et al., 2008). An optimal organism would obviously be perfectly plastic, and respond directly to any change in conditions with the most appropriate phenotype. Plasticity may, however, be associated with significant costs and constrains (DeWitt et al., 1998; Murren et al., 2015). In particular, only predictable change that is correlated to a reliable signal can be tackled with phenotypic plasticity (Scheiner, 1993). Phenotypic plasticity is therefore ill-suited to deal with quickly fluctuating conditions (Tufto, 2015), bso unpredictable conditions call for other strategies.

A fixed response in unpredictably changing conditions is potentially detrimental, because the otherwise high-performing lineage may fail in a single year and thus achieve an overall fitness of zero. More generally, a genotype that is only adapted to the mean condition of a variable environment experiences fitness variance between years (Starrfelt & Kokko, 2012). This fitness variance entails costs, because reproduction as a multiplicative process needs to be calculated based on the geometric mean, and the geometric mean decreases with variance (Cohen, 1966). Therefore the best strategy in an unpredictable environment may not be the one that yields the highest arithmetic mean fitness, but one that minimizes the between-years variance. Strategies that reduce fitness variance at the cost of arithmetic mean fitness are called bet-hedging. Bet-hedgers may reduce between-years variance by either avoiding any risk (conservative bet-hedging), or by spreading the risk among the offspring and investing in a range of phenotypes (diversified bet-hedging). 

Bet-hedging strategies are beneficial in entirely unpredictable environments, whereas phenotypic plasticity is best-suited for perfectly predictable environments. Both scenarios are unrealistic, however, because conditions in natural environments are associated with partially predictive cues, and an optimal strategy should strike a balance between plasticity and bet-hedging (e.g. Donaldson-Matasci et al., 2013; Grantham et al., 2016). Indeed, a mixed strategy of plasticity and bet-hedging can exist (Furness et al., 2015), and the two strategies trade off against each other (Simons, 2014). The relationship among bet-hedging and (partial) predictability can be illustrated by a refined view of a reaction norm (Fig. 1). A phenotypic reaction norm sees the phenotype as function of some environmental state.  In the case of two discrete polyphenisms, the change in phenotypes can be approximated by a logit-curve (the environment should be discrete as well). Actually, the environment is rarely sampled directly, so the reaction norm should be a (phenotype~cue) function, with a cue that is correlated to the environmental state.

An imperfect correlation of cue and environment is particularly problematic for logit-functions: If the position on the x-axis(environmental state) is not determined correctly, the phenotype is easily mismatched. Centering the logit-curve around the cue that is on average equal to  the environmental switch-point will yield the highest arithmetic mean fitness, but  it ignores fitness variance (the phenotype will often be mismatched). A better strategy to increase geometric mean is to make the phenotype-cue curve less steep: Only a fraction of each phenotype is expressed along a larger range of environments, so at least some phenotypes will match with the environment. This increases the number of mismatched phenotypes and hence reduces arithmetic mean fitness, but also reduces fitness correlations among the offspring and thus may increase geometric mean fitness – We call this diversified bet-hedging. If the two environments are unequal (1 harsh, 1 good), it may also be an alternative to shift along the x-axis, so that the harsh-environment phenotype (e.g. diapausing stages or seed dormancy) occurs more often than it should on average. This reduces mean fitness but also fitness variance (conservative bet-hedging). Phrased like this, bet-hedging can be defined as the shape of the reaction norm. 

Fig 1: illustration of bet-hedging as attribute of phenotypic reaction norms. A) logistic phenotypic reaction norm, as is common for two-state polyphenisms. An organisms relies on a cue to switch between two states. Red: organism with a flat slope in reaction norm. Need to work on visualisation.
B) fitness of organism with steep (black) and flat (red) slope in stable and fluctuating environments. All ofspring of the non-hedging (black) population have the same fitness, because they switch synchronously when environments change. This causes the line to go extinct when facing a “bad” year. The offspring of the bet-hedging lines differ in fitness, depending on the amount of mismatch with the environment. This causes lower fitness in stable environments, but also lower fitness variance in fluctuating conditions. 


The canonical and best-studied example of diversified bet-hedging is that of annual desert plants: Rainfall in deserts is entirely unpredictable, so the environment fluctuates between drought years and wet years. Variability in seed germination ensures that not all seeds enter the vulnerable seedling stage at once. Some dormant seeds can thus survive to the next year in drought years (Cohen, 1966).  Expressed as reaction norm slopes: The germination probability is not a steep logit-curve, but a nearly flat curve that spreads germination over several years. 
One potential alternative model is a multivoltine insect that grows exponentially over summer, but needs to time diapause so that an early onset of winter does not drive all offspring to extinction. Such a system shares the key characteristics with the classical case of desert annuals: Insects that diapause already early in the year trade safe overwintering against a loss in exponential growth and are insofar comparable to seeds that remain dormant for several years. In contrast to the desert annual case, however, the onset of harsh conditions is partially predictable, as insects may rely on the autumnal drop in temperature as partially reliable cue. 

It has been shown experimentally that the response to short days frequently follows a logit-curve (photoperiodic response curve, Dixon & Glen, 1971; Lamb & Pointing, 1972; Fig. 1),urbanski and bradshaw instead) and there is a range of day lengths at which diapause is probabilistic among one mother’s offspring (c.f. Fig. 1A). The arrival of winter is variable and hence difficult to predict, which should favour bet-hedging responses (Halkett et al., 2004). I thus assume that the width of the range with random sex determination, i.e. the slope of the photoperiodic response curve, can serve as bet-hedging trait to cope with variability in winter onset. Moreover, the timing is partially adjusted via phenotypic plasticity, as warm temperature can delay the photoperiodic response (Lamb & Pointing, 1972). In relatively predictable environments the organisms hence need to rely less on bet-hedging, and are expected to have a steeper slope regardless of environmental variability.  The photoperiodic response of insects hence includes both a potential bet-hedging response and partial predictability.

Providing empirical evidence for bet-hedging is a challenge, as one would have to demonstrate that variability is not random noise but has long-term fitness consequences. One reasonably good line of evidence would be to demonstrate a covariation of environmental and physiological variability (Simons 2011) across genotypes. We hence conducted a meta-analysis. First we derived photoperiodic response curves from 350 populations from over 60 published studies. Secondly, we calculated variability and predictability of winter onset, using a network of 30,000 climate stations. Thirdly, we correlated the slope of the PRCs with environmental variability and predictability.
