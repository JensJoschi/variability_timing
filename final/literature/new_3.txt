J	Scriber, JM; Sonke, B				Scriber, J. Mark; Sonke, Brittany			Effects of diurnal temperature range on adult size and emergence times from diapausing pupae in Papilio glaucus and P. canadensis (Papilionidae)	INSECT SCIENCE												With recent climate warming trends, both the increase in thermal variance (i.e., diurnal temperature range; DTR) as well as increased mean temperature may impact many different organisms, especially poikilothermic invertebrates. Predictions of insect developmental rates using degree-days (thermal unit accumulations above the developmental base threshold of the insect) are based on daily mean temperatures, regardless of DTR. However, non-linearity and variance in the means and extremes are often ignored. The role of thermal variance (e. g., daily temperature extremes and DTR) was evaluated experimentally for two swallowtail butterfly sister species using a common day/night photoperiod of 18 : 6 h photo : scoto-phase and corresponding daytime thermophase and nighttime cryophase periods of 22 : 22 degrees C (constant 22 degrees C), 24 : 16 degrees C, and 26 : 10 degrees C (all three treatments had the same daily mean and the same degree-day accumulations). Although developmental rates of post-diapause pupae were largely unaffected for both species, our results show that sizes in P. canadensis females (but not males) were smaller in the treatments with more variance (26 degrees C : 10 degrees C) compared to constant 22 degrees C. Such potentially significant impacts of size reduction in P. canadensis females were not observed in P. glaucus males or females under the same series of thermo-period treatments.																	1672-9609	1744-7917				AUG	2011	18	4					435	442		10.1111/j.1744-7917.2011.01432.x								WOS:000293455800007						
J	Dalin, P				Dalin, Peter			Diapause induction and termination in a commonly univoltine leaf beetle (Phratora vulgatissima)	INSECT SCIENCE												The leaf beetle Phratora vulgatissima (Linnaeus 1758) is commonly univoltine in south-central Sweden but may sometimes initiate a partial second generation. The current study was set out to investigate under what abiotic conditions the beetles initiate a second generation. Using climate chamber experiments, the beetles were shown to have a facultative reproductive diapause induced by declining day-length. The critical day-length (CDL) for diapause induction was estimated to be 18 h and 10 min. In the field, first-generation beetles developing to adulthood before August in 2009 became reproductively active and produced a second generation, but most individuals emerged later and were in reproductive diapause. P. vulgatissima overwinter as adults and diapause was shown to be maintained until mid-winter in 2008/2009. The cumulative temperature requirement for oviposition after diapause termination was estimated to be 222 day-degrees with a 5.5 degrees C temperature threshold. Three different day-degree models that were developed to predict the phenology of female oviposition in the spring were validated by comparing model results with field data on the timing of oviposition in previous years. The study suggests that P. vulgatissima may initiate a second generation in Sweden if development of the first generation is completed before August. Warmer spring and summer temperatures due to ongoing climate change may cause advanced insect phenology and faster completion of insect life-cycles at northern latitudes, which will affect the proportion of insects that initiate a second generation.																	1672-9609	1744-7917				AUG	2011	18	4					443	450		10.1111/j.1744-7917.2011.01417.x								WOS:000293455800008

Here, we look for evidence of range-wide and local adaptation at candidate genes for adaptive phenology in balsam poplar, Populus balsamifera, a widespread forest tree whose range extends across environmental gradients of photoperiod and growing season length. We examined nucleotide diversity of 27 poplar homologs of the flowering-time network-a group of genes that control plant developmental phenology through interactions with environmental cues such as photoperiod and temperature. Only one gene, ZTL2, showed evidence of reduced diversity and an excess of fixed replacement sites, consistent with a species-wide selective sweep. Two other genes, LFY and FRI, harbored high levels of nucleotide diversity and exhibited elevated differentiation between northern and southern accessions, suggesting local adaptation along a latitudinal gradient. Interestingly, FRI has also been identified as a target of local selection between northern and southern accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana, indicating that this gene may be commonly involved in ecological adaptation in distantly related species. Our findings suggest an important role for local selection shaping molecular diversity and reveal limitations of inferring molecular adaptation from analyses designed only to detect species-wide selective sweeps.

J	Prendergast, BJ				Prendergast, Brian J.			Can Photoperiod Predict Mortality in the 1918-1920 Influenza Pandemic?	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL RHYTHMS												Amplitude of the seasonal change in day length increases with distance from the equator, and changes in day length markedly alter immune function in diverse nonhuman animal models of infection. Historical records of mortality data, ambient temperature, population density, geography, and economic indicators from 42 countries during 1918-1920 were analyzed to determine relative contributions toward human mortality during the "Spanish" influenza pandemic of 1918-1920. The data identify a strong negative relation between distance from the equator and mortality during the 1918-1920 influenza pandemic, which, in a multiple regression model, manifested independent of major economic, demographic, and temperature variables. Enhanced survival was evident in populations that experienced a winter nadir day length <= 10 h light/day, relative to those that experienced lower amplitude changes in photoperiod. Numerous reports indicate that exposure to short day lengths, typical of those occurring outside the tropics during winter, yields robust and enduring reductions in the magnitude of cytokine, febrile, and behavioral responses to infection. The present results are preliminary but prompt the conjecture that, if similar mechanisms are operant in humans, then they would be predicted to mitigate symptoms of infection in proportion to an individual's distance from the equator. Although limitations and uncertainties accompany regression-based analyses of historical epidemiological data, latitude, per se, may be an underrecognized factor in mortality during the 1918-1920 influenza pandemic. The author proposes that some proportion of the global variance in morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases may be explained by effects of day length on the innate immune response to infection.																	0748-7304					AUG	2011	26	4					345	352		10.1177/0748730411409708								WOS:000292877500007	21775293

Recent findings hint at the potential importance of mammals affecting the spatial dynamics of aquatic organisms in areas where mammals live in close association with water. Perhaps the most iconic example of such an environment is the African savannah. 2. We investigated dispersal patterns of freshwater organisms among a set of temporary ponds in SE Zimbabwe to test the hypothesis that large mammals, and particularly African elephants (Loxodonta africana), can be important vectors of aquatic organisms. Dispersal kernels were reconstructed by hatching mud collected from 'rubbing' trees located at increasing distances from a set of isolated ponds. To assess the relative importance of other mammalian vectors, the vertical distribution of mud on rubbing trees was mapped and related to the body size of candidate vector species. 3. Laboratory hatching of mud samples revealed large numbers of propagules of 22 invertebrate taxa as well as some aquatic macrophytes. Dispersing communities reflected source communities and diverged with increasing distance from the source. Both dispersal rates and richness of transported taxa decreased significantly with dispersal distance. No indications for differences in dispersal capacity among propagule types were detected. Instead, common propagules were more likely to travel greater distances. Most mud was attached to trees at heights > 1.5 m, implicating elephants as the dominant vector. Vertical distributions of tree mud, however, also revealed clustering at heights up to 50 cm and 90-120 cm corresponding to the height of warthog, rhinoceros and buffalo, respectively. Finally, variation in the vertical distribution of mud on trees in combination with differences in vector vagility suggests that local differences in vector species composition may affect passive dispersal dynamics of aquatic organisms. 4. Based on vagility and vector load, mud-wallowing mammals emerge as highly effective vectors that, in some areas, may be more important in transporting aquatic organisms than traditionally recognised vectors such as waterbirds. Since most large-and medium-sized mammals currently have restricted geographic distributions, it is likely that mammal-mediated dispersal was more important in the past.

Douglas			Light increases the rate of embryonic development: implications for latitudinal trends in incubation period	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												1. In wild birds, incubation period shortens and the general pace of life quickens with distance from the equator. Temperature and various biotic factors, including adult behaviours, cannot fully account for longer incubation periods of equatorial birds and only explain some of the variation between tropical and temperate life histories. Here we consider the role of differences in light in driving variation in incubation period. In poultry, incubation periods can be experimentally shortened by exposing eggs to light. The positive influence of light on embryonic growth, called photoacceleration, can begin within hours after an egg is laid. 2. We artificially incubated house sparrow (Passer domesticus) eggs under photoperiods similar to those found at temperate (18Light : 6Dark) and tropical (12L : 12D) latitudes. We also measured embryonic metabolic rate during light and dark phases. 3. Eggs of house sparrows collected from the wild developed more rapidly under 'temperate' than 'tropical' photoperiods and had higher metabolic rates during phases of light exposure than during phases of darkness. Metabolic rates during light phases were high enough to account for a 1 day difference in incubation periods between temperate and tropical birds. 4. Based on a synthesis of photoacceleration studies on domesticated galliformes and our experimental results on a wild passerine, we provide the first support for the testable hypothesis that differences in photoperiod may influence variation in the rate of embryonic development across latitudes in birds.

J	Hut, RA; Beersma, DGM				Hut, R. A.; Beersma, D. G. M.			Evolution of time-keeping mechanisms: early emergence and adaptation to photoperiod	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Virtually all species have developed cellular oscillations and mechanisms that synchronize these cellular oscillations to environmental cycles. Such environmental cycles in biotic (e. g. food availability and predation risk) or abiotic (e. g. temperature and light) factors may occur on a daily, annual or tidal time scale. Internal timing mechanisms may facilitate behavioural or physiological adaptation to such changes in environmental conditions. These timing mechanisms commonly involve an internal molecular oscillator (a 'clock') that is synchronized ('entrained') to the environmental cycle by receptor mechanisms responding to relevant environmental signals ('Zeitgeber', i.e. German for time-giver). To understand the evolution of such timing mechanisms, we have to understand the mechanisms leading to selective advantage. Although major advances have been made in our understanding of the physiological and molecular mechanisms driving internal cycles (proximate questions), studies identifying mechanisms of natural selection on clock systems (ultimate questions) are rather limited. Here, we discuss the selective advantage of a circadian system and how its adaptation to day length variation may have a functional role in optimizing seasonal timing. We discuss various cases where selective advantages of circadian timing mechanisms have been shown and cases where temporarily loss of circadian timing may cause selective advantage. We suggest an explanation for why a circadian timing system has emerged in primitive life forms like cyanobacteria and we evaluate a possible molecular mechanism that enabled these bacteria to adapt to seasonal variation in day length. We further discuss how the role of the circadian system in photoperiodic time measurement may explain differential selection pressures on circadian period when species are exposed to changing climatic conditions (e. g. global warming) or when they expand their geographical range to different latitudes or altitudes.

ALTERATION OF CIRCADIAN RHYTHMICITY OF CD3+CD4+LYMPHOCYTE SUBPOPULATION IN HEALTHY AGING	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL REGULATORS AND HOMEOSTATIC AGENTS												The CD4+ T helper/inducer and the CD8+ T suppressor/cytotoxic are major lymphocyte subsets that play a key role in cell-mediated immunity. Aging-related changes of immune function have been demonstrated. The purpose of this study is to analyze the dynamics of variation of these specific lymphocyte subsets in the elderly. In our study cortisol and melatonin serum levels were measured and lymphocyte subpopulation analyses were performed on blood samples collected every four hours for 24 hours from fifteen healthy young middle-aged subjects (age range 36-55 years) and fifteen healthy elderly male subjects (age range 67-79 years). A clear circadian rhythm was validated for the time-qualified changes of CD3+ and CD4+ cells with acrophase at night and for the time-qualified changes of CD8+ cells with acrophase at noon in young middle-aged subjects and for the time-qualified changes of CD3+ cells with acrophase at night and for the time-qualified changes of CD8+ cells with acrophase at noon in elderly subjects. No clear circadian rhythm was validated for the time-qualified changes of CD4+ cells in elderly subjects. No statistically significant correlation among lymphocyte subsets was found in elderly subjects. In elderly subjects CD3+ lymphocyte percentage was higher in the photoperiod and in the scotoperiod and cortisol serum level were higher in the scotoperiod in respect to young-middle-aged subjects. In the elderly there is an alteration of circadian rhythmicity of T helper/inducer lymphocytes and this phenomenon might contribute to the aging-related changes of immune responses.

Vagabond males and sedentary females: spatial ecology and mating system of the speckled rattlesnake (Crotalus mitchellii)	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY												We used radiotelemetric data and behavioural observations to characterize seasonal (mating versus post-mating seasons) and sexual variation in movement patterns, as well as to examine some of the ecological factors contributing to the evolution of the mating system in a venomous predator from the Mojave Desert of North America, the speckled rattlesnake, Crotalus mitchellii. Mating occurs in spring from late April to early June, shortly after emergence from hibernation, when snakes are predictably aggregated around the dens. Males and females travelled further per unit time in the mating season compared to the post-mating season. Males also travelled longer distances per unit time than females in the mating and post-mating seasons, and males with larger home ranges during the mating season had more potential mating partners. The results obtained suggest that males actively locate females during the mating season, and that the drastic increase in distance travelled by males during the mating season may be caused by strong male male competition for access to females, probably because of the limited availability of sexually receptive females. Furthermore, males fight for access to females, and males of larger size are more likely to acquire females. Therefore, sexual selection apparently acts on two different male phenotypic traits: investment in mate-searching activities and male body size. The present study demonstrates that combining quantitative spatial analyses and behavioural observations in an explicit temporal context can significantly advance our understanding of the ecology and evolution of organismal mating systems.

J	Sadakiyo, S; Ishihara, M				Sadakiyo, Shou; Ishihara, Michihiro			Rapid seasonal adaptation of an alien bruchid after introduction: geographic variation in life cycle synchronization and critical photoperiod for diapause induction	ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA												Whether alien insects that are introduced into temperate regions adapt to seasonally changing environmental conditions is an important question in evolutionary biology. If rapid evolution has occurred in a non-native environment, a latitudinal cline in critical photoperiod for diapause induction (i.e., the photoperiod at which half of the individuals enter diapause) and in life cycle synchronization with host plant phenology should be evident among locations. The alien bruchid Acanthoscelides pallidipennis (Motschulsky) (Coleoptera: Bruchidae) is native to North America and introduced into Japan with the host plant Amorpha fruticosa L. (Fabaceae) in the late 1940s. To examine whether seasonal adaptation has occurred in A. pallidipennis, we conducted a laboratory experiment and phenological observations using three latitudinally different populations. We bred F1 eggs at 22 degrees C and five photoperiodic regimens - L: D = 10: 14, 13: 11, 14: 10, 15: 9, or 16: 8 hours - and examined whether diapause was induced. The estimated critical photoperiod for diapause induction was longest in the most northern population and shortest in themost southern population. Life cycle was found to be synchronized with host phenology in each location. Also voltinism varied geographically, from univoltine in the northern population to bivoltine in the southern populations. These results showed that A. pallidipennis rapidly adapted to seasonal environmental conditions in Japan after its introduction.																	0013-8703					JUL	2011	140	1					69	76		10.1111/j.1570-7458.2011.01136.x								WOS:000292745300008

In contrast, in the satyrine butterfly Ypthima multistriata Butler, local populations with different voltinism patterns are geographically intermingled, suggesting that life-history traits related to diapause may differ even between geographically and phylogenetically close populations. In this study, we experimentally examined the critical photoperiod for diapause induction and the larval developmental period in two univoltine and two bivoltine populations of Y. multistriata, all of which inhabit virtually the same latitude ( 34.652-34.750 degrees N). We found that the critical photoperiod for diapause induction was longer in the univoltine populations than in the bivoltine populations. Moreover, the larval period under the long day length treatment was different among populations in both sexes, although significant differences were also detected between populations with the same voltinism. These results indicate that in Y. multistriata, life-history traits related to diapause can not be attributed merely to climatic conditions such as temperature or day length, which depend largely on latitude. Therefore, we suggest that biotic elements, such as leaf toughness, as well as abiotic elements should be taken into account in attempts to explain the enigmatic pattern of geographic variation in the diapause strategies of Y. multistriata.

Polymorphism in the couch potato gene clines in eastern Australia but is not associated with ovarian dormancy in Drosophila melanogaster	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Natural selection can generate parallel latitudinal clines in traits and gene frequencies across continents, but these have rarely been linked. An amino acid (isoleucine to lysine, or I462K) polymorphism of the couch potato (cpo) gene in Drosophila melanogaster is thought to control female reproductive diapause cline in North America (Schmidt et al. 2008, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 105, 16207-16211). Here, we show that under standard diapause-inducing conditions (12 degrees C and short photoperiod) (Saunders et al. 1989, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 86, 3748-3752), egg maturation in Australian flies is delayed, but not arrested at previtellogenic stages. At 12 degrees C, the phenotypic distribution in egg development was bimodal at stages 8 and 14 and showed a strong nonlinear pattern on the east coast of Australia, with incidence of egg maturation delay (ovarian dormancy) increasing both toward tropical and temperate climates. Furthermore, we found no evidence for an association between the cpo I462K polymorphism and ovarian dormancy at either 12 or 10 degrees C (when egg maturation was often delayed at stage 7). Owing to strong linkage disequilibrium, the latitudinal cline in cpo allele frequencies was no longer evident once variation in the In(3R) P inversion polymorphism was taken into account. Our results suggest that the standard diapause-inducing conditions (12 degrees C and short photoperiod) were not sufficient to cause the typical previtellogenic developmental arrest in Australian flies and that the cpo I462K polymorphism does not explain the observed delay in egg development. In conclusion, ovarian dormancy does not show a simple latitudinal cline, and the lack of cpo-dormancy association suggests a different genetic basis to reproductive dormancy in North America and Australia.

Two opposite phylogeographical scenarios have already been demonstrated in rotifers, which consist of high levels of genetic differentiation among populations even on small geographical scales on the one hand and the traditionally known cosmopolitanism that is associated with high levels of gene flow and long-distance dispersal via diapausing stages on the other hand. Here, we analysed the population genetic structure and the phylogeography of the Brachionus calyciflorus species complex in eastern China. By screening a total of 318 individuals from ten locations along a 2320-km gradient and analysing samples from two growing seasons, we aimed at focusing on both small-and large-scale patterns. We identified eight cryptic species and verified species status of two of these by sexual reproduction tests. Samples in summer and winter yielded different cryptic species. The distribution patterns of these genetically distinct cryptic species were diverse across eastern China, from full cosmopolitanism to local endemism. The two most abundant cryptic species BcWIII and BcSW showed a pattern of strong genetic differentiation among populations and no significant isolation by distance. Long-distance colonization, secondary contact and recent range expansion are probably responsible for the indistinct pattern of isolation by distance. Our results suggest that geographical distance is more important than temporal segregation across seasons in explaining population differentiation and the occurrence of cryptic species. We explain the current phylogeographical structure in the B. calyciflorus species complex by a combination of recent population expansion, restricted gene flow, priority effects and long-distance colonization.																	0962-1083					JUL	2011	20	14					3027	3044		10.1111/j.1365-294X.2011.05147.x								WOS:000292445700014	21672065

In all other regions investigated, P. brassicae pupae only hibernate. The transitional zone from non-aestivating to aestivating populations is a geographically stable region south of the Pyrenees. The restriction of this response to this region cannot be accounted for in terms of genetics as aestivation is intermediately inherited, with the heritability (h(2)) of aestivation in inbreeding lines between 0.35 and 0.77. Two hypotheses are presented to explain why this species does not aestivate in more northern regions. First, aestivation is a behaviour that serves to synchronize generations in areas where this species produces a high number of generations per year. Second, aestivation reduces the incidence of parasitism suffered by the butterfly by desynchronizing its life cycle from that of its main parasitoid, Cotesia glomerata. The two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive and both seem to be adaptive where the species is multivoltine.																	1210-5759					JUL 1	2011	108	3					377	384		10.14411/eje.2011.047								WOS:000291955100006						
J	Erfmeier, A; Bohnke, M; Bruelheide, H				Erfmeier, Alexandra; Boehnke, Martin; Bruelheide, Helge			Secondary invasion of Acer negundo: the role of phenotypic responses versus local adaptation	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												During plant species invasions, the role of adaptive processes is particularly of interest in later stages of range expansion when populations start invading habitats that initially have not been disposed to invasions. The dioecious tree Acer negundo, primarily invasive in Europe in wet habitats along riversides and in floodplains, has increased its abundance in dry habitats of industrial wasteland and ruderal sites during the last decades in Eastern Germany. We chose 21 invasive populations from wet and from dry habitats in the region of Halle, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany, to test whether Acer negundo exhibits a shift in life-history strategy during expansion into more stressful habitats. We analyzed variables of habitat quality (pH, soil moisture, exchangeable cations, total C and N content) and determined density, sex ratio and regeneration of the populations. In addition, we conducted germination experiments and greenhouse studies with seedlings in four different soil moisture environments. Local adaptation was studied in a reciprocal transplant experiment. We found habitat type differentiation with lower nutrient and water supply at the dry sites than at the moist sites and significant differences in the number of seedlings in the field. In accordance, seeds from moist habitats responded significantly faster to germination treatments. In the transplant experiment, leaf life span was significantly larger for populations originating from dry habitat types than from moist habitats. This observed shift in life history strategy during secondary invasion of A. negundo from traits of establishment and rapid growth towards traits connected with persistence might be counteracted by high gene flow among populations of the different habitat types. However, prolonged leaf life span at dry sites contributed remarkably to the invasion of less favourable habitats, and, thus, is a first indication of ongoing adaptation.

Th			Effect of Several Different Pollens on the Bio-Ecological Parameters of the Predatory Mite Typhlodromus athenas Swirski and Ragusa (Acari: Phytoseiidae)	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												The development, survivorship, and reproduction of the predacious mite Typhlodromus athenas Swirski and Ragusa were studied in the laboratory by rearing the predator on nine different plant pollens [almond(Prunus amygdalis Batsch), apple (Malus domestica Borkh.), apricot (Prunus armeniaca L.), cherry (Prunus avium L.), pear (Pyrus communis L.), plum (Prunus domestica L.), walnut (Juglans regia L.), olive (Olea europaea L.), Typha sp.], and pollen collected from bee hives. All experiments were conducted in environmental chambers at 20 +/- 1 degrees C, 65% RH, and a photoperiod of 16: 8 (L: D) h. Survival during immature development ranged from 81.1 to 96.0%. The shortest mean developmental time from egg to adult with respect to the range of pollen species was recorded for females and males fed on almond pollen (10.76 +/- 0.18 and 10.45 +/- 0.21 d, respectively), while the longest was on beehive pollen (26.97 +/- 0.23 and 24.00 +/- 0.25 d for females and males, respectively). Female longevity varied from 51.63 +/- 5.52 d (olive pollen) to 102.81 +/- 6.60 d (pear pollen), while fecundity ranged from 5.33 +/- 2.35 eggs per female (beehive pollen) to 26.43 +/- 1.73 eggs per female (almond pollen). The diet consisting of almond pollen resulted in the highest intrinsic rate of natural increase (r(m)) (1.00 d(-1)) and pollen collected from bee hives resulted in the lowest (0.013 d(-1)). These results showed that various pollen could favor the development of T. athenas, and also support the view that alternative food resources may play an important role in the field for sustaining and increasing the predator's population.																	0046-225X	1938-2936				JUN	2011	40	3					597	604		10.1603/EN10276								WOS:000294111700012	22251637

E.; Yant, Levi; Mott, Richard; Weigel, Detlef			Genetic Architecture of Flowering-Time Variation in Arabidopsis thaliana	GENETICS												The onset of flowering is an important adaptive trait in plants. The small ephemeral species Arabidopsis thaliana grows under a wide range of temperature and day-length conditions across much of the Northern hemisphere, and a number of flowering-time loci that vary between different accessions have been identified before. However, only few studies have addressed the species-wide genetic architecture of flowering-time control. We have taken advantage of a set of 18 distinct accessions that present much of the common genetic diversity of A. thaliana and mapped quantitative trait loci (QTL) for flowering time in 17 F-2 populations derived from these parents. We found that the majority of flowering-time QTL cluster in as few as five genomic regions, which include the locations of the entire FLC/MAF clade of transcription factor genes. By comparing effects across shared parents, we conclude that in several cases there might be an allelic series caused by rare alleles. While this finding parallels results obtained for maize, in contrast to maize much of the variation in flowering time in A. thaliana appears to be due to large-effect alleles.

Although the hemlock looper causes extensive damages, no information on the mechanisms related to its cold tolerance is known. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of temperature and exposure duration on hemlock looper winter survival but also to identify seasonal supercooling capacity and cryoprotectant levels of three populations along a latitudinal gradient. As host plant may contribute to offspring overwintering success, cold tolerance of hemlock looper eggs from parents whose larvae were fed on three different tree species was also measured. Mean supercooling point (SCP) of hemlock looper eggs was lower than -30 degrees C from October through the following spring with values being as low as -47 degrees C in February. Trehalose was the most abundant sugar found in hemlock looper eggs with a peak concentration of 0.3 mu g mg(-1) DW(-1). Glycerol, a polyol, was more often absent in eggs of the different populations and tree species tested in the study. When exposed to different temperature regimes for various periods of time, significant mortality of hemlock looper eggs occurred at higher temperatures than the mean SCP. Thus, hemlock looper could be considered as a chill tolerant species. No clear pattern of population and host plant effects on SCP and cryoprotectants was detected in this study. However, when exposed to different winter temperatures and exposure duration, hemlock looper from higher latitudes survived better (survival rates ranging between 0 and 89% at -20 degrees C) than those from lower latitudes (survival rates ranging between 0 and 56% at -20 degrees C). Our results may contribute to a better understanding of hemlock looper winter biology and thus facilitate predictions of outbreaks and range expansion. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Use of DNA barcoding to detect invertebrate invasive species from diapausing eggs	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												The global transhipment of ballast water and associated flora and fauna by cargo vessels has increased dramatically in recent decades. Invertebrate species are frequently carried in ballast water and sediment, although identification of diapausing eggs can be extremely problematic. Here we test the application of DNA barcoding using mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and 16S rDNA to identify species from diapausing eggs collected in ballast sediment of ships. The accuracy of DNA barcoding identification was tested by comparing results from the molecular markers against each other, and by comparing barcoding results to traditional morphological identification of individuals hatched from diapausing eggs. Further, we explored two public genetic databases to determine the broader applicability of DNA barcodes. Of 289 diapausing eggs surveyed, sufficient DNA for barcoding was obtained from 96 individuals (33%). Unsuccessful DNA extractions from 67% of eggs in our study were most likely due to degraded condition of eggs. Of 96 eggs with successful DNA extraction, 61 (64%) were identified to species level, while 36% were identified to possible family/order level. Species level identifications were always consistent between methodologies. DNA barcoding was suitable for a wide range of taxa, including Branchiopoda, Copepoda, Rotifera, Bryozoa and Ascidia. Branchiopoda and Copepoda were respectively the best and worst represented groups in genetic databases. Though genetic databases remain incomplete, DNA barcoding resolved nearly double the number of species identified by traditional taxonomy (19 vs. 10). Notorious invaders are well represented in existing databases, rendering these NIS detectable using molecular methods. DNA barcoding provides a rapid and accurate approach to identification of invertebrate diapausing eggs that otherwise would be very difficult to identify.

As organisms expand their range towards northern latitudes they will encounter selective factors like harsh winter conditions. The ability to cope with and adapt to harsh winters may depend on the variability and evolutionary potential of relevant traits. 2. One adaptation in insects is winter diapause. It is characterized by changes in physiology, behaviour or in both. Physiological changes include lowered metabolic rate that enhances survival by saving limited energy reserves during overwintering. Active behavioural changes like burrowing into the soil allow individuals to escape harsh conditions. 3. We examined variation in overwintering body mass, resting metabolic rate (CO(2) production) and diapause behaviour (burrowing into the soil), and their effects on overwintering success in the adult Colorado potato beetles (Leptinotarsa decemlineata). We conducted a full-sib/half-sib rearing experiment to estimate the evolutionary potential (heritability) of these traits. 4. High overwintering body mass and low metabolic rate were phenotypically associated with high diapause propensity (i.e. burrowing), which was linked to high overwintering survival. We found that once beetles had entered the soil, only large body mass of males was associated with high overwintering survival. However, the heritability estimates in all traits examined were low. 5. Our results show that winter conditions impose selection on diapause behaviour, which was linked to lower metabolic rate and larger body mass. If range expansion to higher latitudes requires adaptive genetic changes in diapause behaviour, metabolism, or body mass, the insufficient genetic variation in these traits suggest that the Colorado potato beetle's future potential to respond to selection due to harsher winters could be limited and thus, its range expansion could be hindered. Both physiological and behavioural adaptations are important to consider when assessing range expansion potential.

J	Signer, C; Ruf, T; Arnold, W				Signer, Claudio; Ruf, Thomas; Arnold, Walter			Hypometabolism and basking: the strategies of Alpine ibex to endure harsh over-wintering conditions	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												P>1. The extent to which free-ranging large north-temperate mammals seasonally adjust thermoregulation and their energy expenditure under fully natural conditions are unknown. 2. Therefore, using telemetry we measured the heart rate (as a proxy for metabolic rate), rumen temperature (T-r) and locomotor activity (LA) over 2 years for 20 free-ranging Alpine ibex (Capra ibex ibex) living at high altitudes in the Alps. 3. Ibex showed strong seasonal changes in mean daily heart rate with a winter nadir of about 60% below the summer peak. Only 40% of this variation could be attributed to the changes in daily mean T-r, LA, wind chill, body size and snowfall. The unexplained residual variation in heart rate still showed a strong seasonal pattern. 4. The amplitude of daily rhythms in T-r was twice as high during the winter when compared with summer. This was predominantly due to lower daily minimum T-r. Thus, the substantial down-regulation of endogenous heat production during winter - as indicated by heart rate - had surprisingly small effects on T-r, indicating decreased thermal conductance. 5. Rewarming from the daily T-r minimum during the morning hours was independent of heart rate throughout the year, and occurred phase-delayed to the increase in black bulb temperature (BBT). The effects of BBT and LA on the rate of rewarming were maximized within a small range of BBT around 0 degrees C. This suggests that the ibex moved at sunrise to the closest sunny spot to facilitate extensive basking. 6. The energetic benefits of basking can explain the strong residual seasonality of heart rate in Alpine ibex. This partially ectothermic strategy - together with metabolic depression - apparently enables a thrifty use of body fat reserves, the major metabolic fuel during winter, and thus survival of extremely harsh winter conditions despite the virtual absence of food. Therefore, hypometabolism and passive rewarming by basking may be of general importance as a strategy for non-hibernating mammals to survive winter in strongly seasonal habitats.

J	Hagen, M; Wikelski, M; Kissling, WD				Hagen, Melanie; Wikelski, Martin; Kissling, W. Daniel			Space Use of Bumblebees (Bombus spp.) Revealed by Radio-Tracking	PLOS ONE												Background: Accurate estimates of movement behavior and distances travelled by animals are difficult to obtain, especially for small-bodied insects where transmitter weights have prevented the use of radio-tracking. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we report the first successful use of micro radio telemetry to track flight distances and space use of bumblebees. Using ground surveys and Cessna overflights in a Central European rural landscape mosaic we obtained maximum flight distances of 2.5 km, 1.9 km and 1.3 km for Bombus terrestris (workers), Bombus ruderatus (worker), and Bombus hortorum (young queens), respectively. Bumblebee individuals used large areas (0.25-43.53 ha) within one or a few days. Habitat analyses of one B. hortorum queen at the landscape scale indicated that gardens within villages were used more often than expected from habitat availability. Detailed movement trajectories of this individual revealed that prominent landscape structures (e. g. trees) and flower patches were repeatedly visited. However, we also observed long (i.e. >45 min) resting periods between flights (B. hortorum) and differences in flower-handling between bumblebees with and without transmitters (B. terrestris) suggesting that the current weight of transmitters (200 mg) may still impose significant energetic costs on the insects. Conclusions/Significance: Spatio-temporal movements of bumblebees can now be tracked with telemetry methods. Our measured flight distances exceed many previous estimates of bumblebee foraging ranges and suggest that travelling long distances to food resources may be common. However, even the smallest currently available transmitters still appear to compromise flower handling performance and cause an increase in resting behavior of bees. Future reductions of transmitter mass and size could open up new avenues for quantifying landscape-scale space use of insect pollinators and could provide novel insights into the behavior and requirements of bumblebees during critical life stages, e. g. when searching for mates, nest locations or hibernation sites.

Genetic Variation and Inheritance of Diapause Induction in Two Distinct Voltine Ecotypes of Ostrinia nubilalis (Lepidoptera: Crambidae)	ANNALS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), displays a larval diapause in response to short photoperiods and is adapted to a variety of local conditions throughout North America. Hence, the effective photoperiod inducing larval diapause will differ among geographic ecotypes. This study considers the inheritance of photoperiodic larval diapause induction by hybridization and backcrossing two latitudinally distinct ecotypes of the European corn borer collected between 41 degrees N, 96 degrees W and 48 degrees N, 96 degrees W and under a range of photoperiods representative of their respective locations: from 14:10 to 16:8 (L:D) h. The ecotype adapted to a bivoltine habitat (southeastern Nebraska) exhibited a shorter critical photoperiod (1480 h) than the ecotype (1533 h), originating from a univoltine habitat (northwestern Minnesota). Reciprocal F(1) crosses exhibited intermediate values with indication of sex-linked inheritance. In addition, the male parent had significantly more influence on diapause incidence of subsequent progeny than the female. The F(2) and backcross progeny further supported the supposition that diapause response is a sex-linked inheritance. The minimum number of genes estimates, and the response from backcross progeny, suggest that diapause response of European corn borer larva may be controlled by only a few loci. The overall results indicated that both ecotypes had adopted unique diapause responses, which ultimately lead to seasonal synchrony in their ecosystems.

J	Shiroto, A; Satoh, T; Hirota, T				Shiroto, Akiyoshi; Satoh, Toshiyuki; Hirota, Tadao			The Importance of Workers for Queen Hibernation Survival in Camponotus Ants	ZOOLOGICAL SCIENCE												The higher proportion of polygynous ant species in northern areas indicates that cold climates influence queen number per colony. It is unclear, however, what ecological and physiological factors facilitate the dominance of polygynous species in cold climates. This is the case in two common arboreal ants in Japan-Camponotus yamaokai and C. nawai-which are quite similar in morphology, but different in social structure and geographical distribution. Polygynous C. yamaokai inhabits colder areas, whereas monogynyous C. nawai inhabits warmer climates. We compared queen survival in both ants at low temperature to evaluate whether interspecific difference in cold tolerance can explain the geographical distribution. We examined the influence of cohabitation with other individuals, as well as individual cold tolerance. Experimental groups with different caste compositions were prepared and maintained under conditions simulating in the laboratory climates of the northern limit of C. nawai. Wintering experiments revealed that C. yamaokai queens survived longer than C. nawai queens under solitary conditions, although half of the queens died in less than a month, even in C. yamaokai. Queens hibernating with workers survived longer than solitary queens, but queen number did not affect queen survival. Cohabitation with workers allowed 80% of C. yamaokai queens to survive more than two months. Under field conditions, monogynous C. nawai foundresses overwinter without workers, whereas new queens of polygynous C. yamaokai always overwinter with many workers. Thus, the geographical distribution of these ants appears to depend on the overwintering behavior of new queens.

The winter growth habit of barley requires the presence of a recessive VrnH1 allele, together with an active VrnH2 allele. The candidate for VrnH3 (HvFT1) has been recently identified, with evidences pointing at a central role in the integration of the vernalization and photoperiod pathways. Functional polymorphisms have been proposed, but experimental evidence of their role on agronomic performance and adaptation is needed. We examined allelic variation at the promoter and intron 1 of the HvFT1 gene in a landrace collection of barley, finding a high diversity level, with its geographic distribution correlated with latitude. Focusing on genotypes with winter alleles in VrnH1 and VrnH2, an association analysis of the four main HvFT1 haplotypes found in the landrace collection detected differences in time to flowering. Landraces with the intron 1 TC allele, prevalent in the south, flowered 6-7 days earlier than those with the AG allele, under natural conditions. These results were validated in an independent F(2) population. In both data sets, the effect found was similar, but in opposite direction to that described in literature. The polymorphism reported at intron 1 contributes to variation in flowering time under field conditions. We have found that polymorphisms at the promoter also contribute to the effect of the gene on flowering time under field and controlled conditions. The variety of HvFT1 alleles described constitutes an allelic series that may have been a factor in agro-ecological adaptation of barley.

Colony founding and social parasitism in Lasius (Acanthomyops)	INSECTES SOCIAUX												We investigated colony foundation behavior of three species of the Lasius claviger group, L. latipes, L. interjectus and L. claviger, using field observations and laboratory experiments. Laboratory studies included observing gyne behavior prior to interaction with host colonies (e.g. grouping, overwintering, feeding) and experiments in which gynes were introduced to putative host colonies. Observations of gyne parasitic behavior immediately after mating flights in the field and the discovery of mixed colonies both confirm the parasitic behavior of these species and point toward a wide host species range including two cases of hyperparasitism. L. interjectus and L. latipes enter the host colony immediately after the nuptial flight, while L. claviger may hibernate and enter in the spring. Laboratory experiments showed that L. interjectus gynes prefer to group and suffer lower mortality when in a group, which is consistent with field observations of L. interjectus gynes entering host colonies in large numbers. Details on behavior of L. latipes alpha and beta form gynes are also given.																	0020-1812					MAY	2011	58	2					237	244		10.1007/s00040-010-0141-y								WOS:000288515700013

Chronic Phase Shifts of the Photoperiod throughout Pregnancy Programs Glucose Intolerance and Insulin Resistance in the Rat	PLOS ONE												Shift work during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk for preterm birth and low birth weight. However, the impact upon the long term health of the children is currently unknown. In this study, we used an animal model to determine the consequences of maternal shift work exposure on the health of the adult offspring. Pregnant rats were exposed to chronic phase shifts (CPS) in their photoperiod every 3-4 days throughout gestation and the first week after birth. Adult offspring were assessed for a range of metabolic, endocrine, circadian and neurobehavioural parameters. At 3 months of age, male pups exposed to the CPS schedule in utero had increased adiposity (+29%) and hyperleptinaemia (+99% at 0700h). By 12 months of age, both male and female rats displayed hyperleptinaemia (+26% and +41% respectively) and hyperinsulinaemia (+110% and +83% respectively). 12 month old female CPS rats displayed poor glucose tolerance (+18%) and increased insulin secretion (+29%) in response to an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test. In CPS males the glucose response was unaltered, but the insulin response was reduced by 35%. The glucose response to an insulin tolerance test was decreased by 21% in CPS females but unaltered in males. Disruption of circadian rhythmicity during gestation resulted in gender dependent metabolic consequences for the adult offspring. These results highlight the need for a thorough analysis of shift work exposure in utero on the health of the adult offspring in humans.

In China both spring and winter wheat regions are affected by PHS. Sichuan lies in southwest China, where the most of rainfall occurs during April to September when wheat is harvested. The present investigation was conducted to identify the allelic variability of Vp1, a gene that plays a role in maintenance and induction of dormancy, among Sichuan landraces and recent cultivars with different dormancy levels and to find potential sources of PHS resistance for breeding. Sichuan landrace and cultivar wheat accessions had a wide range of dormancy levels. The average germination index (GI) of Sichuan landrace accessions was 0.232, whereas at 0.674 it was much higher for cultivars. The different dormancy levels between landraces and cultivars indicated that pre-harvest sprouting resistance might have been neglected in recent Sichuan wheat breeding programs. The average GI of white grained accessions was higher than for red grained accessions. Particular Vp-1B gene fragments were specific in landraces or cultivars and in white or red grained accessions. The results indicated that Vp-1B markers could be used to distinguish cultivars and landraces. Significant relationships between certain Vp-1B allelesand GI of Sichuan wheat accessions were shown by Spearman's rank correlation analysis.

VARIATION IN LAYING DATE AND CLUTCH SIZE: THE EVERGLADES ENVIRONMENT AND THE ENDANGERED CAPE SABLE SEASIDE SPARROW (AMMODRAMUS MARITIMUS MIRABILIS)	AUK												When to commence breeding is a fundamental decision made by individuals that inhabit seasonal environments. Although photoperiod determines the timing of breeding in most temperate zones, other abiotic conditions can also play a significant role by influencing food availability and, consequently, reproductive performance throughout a breeding cycle. This study used the multibrooded endangered Cape Sable Seaside Sparrow (Ammodramus maritimus mirabilis) to test whether water conditions (rainfall and groundwater levels) influenced breeding variables in a subtropical environment, the Florida Everglades. Timing of breeding was related to rainfall preceding the breeding season, with females initiating nesting up to 1 month earlier in years with greater rainfall. Clutch size averaged 3.4 eggs, and females showed an increase in clutch size as the breeding season progressed and in response to higher groundwater levels during the laying period. This effect was more apparent for first nesting attempts, with drier conditions limiting clutch size. Although wetter conditions favored earlier breeding and larger clutch sizes, annual nest survival (range: 12-36%) was negatively associated with high average rainfall late in the breeding season. Clutch-size variation and high nest survival in Cape Sable Seaside Sparrows' first nesting attempts suggests that food-mediated processes affect their reproductive decisions early in the breeding season, whereas predator-mediated processes drove overall reproductive output, possibly through increased activity of major nest predators during wetter conditions.

J	Seki, Y; Koganezawa, M				Seki, Yoshikazu; Koganezawa, Masaaki			Factors influencing winter home ranges and activity patterns of raccoon dogs Nyctereutes procyonoides in a high-altitude area of Japan	ACTA THERIOLOGICA												Between October 2006 and June 2007, we radio-tracked six adult raccoon dogs Nyctereutes procyonoides (Gray, 1834) in a high-altitude area of Japan to determine which factors influenced home ranges, daily movements, and activity patterns of Japanese raccoon dogs, with an emphasis on the winter season. The home-range sizes for the six individuals were smaller in winter than in autumn. In winter, the daily movement distances significantly decreased in response to decreasing temperature and increasing snow depth, suggesting these environmental factors contributed to a decrease in the home-range sizes during this period. Moreover, during daytime, raccoon dogs were more active in winter than in the snow-free periods (autumn and spring), and the proportion of the daytime movement distances to the total daily movement distances significantly increased as the mean daily air temperatures decreased. Therefore, it appears that the raccoon dogs in our study area passed the winter by minimizing their energy expenditure by restricting their movements when temperatures were at their lowest and snow depth was highest, and by moving more during the daytime when temperatures were higher.																	0001-7051					APR	2011	56	2					171	177		10.1007/s13364-010-0020-y								WOS:000290689600008						
J	Hrasovec, B; Kasumovic, L; Franjevic, M				Hrasovec, Boris; Kasumovic, Luka; Franjevic, Milivoj			Overwintering of Eight Toothed Spruce Bark Beetle (Ips typographus) in Spruce Forests of North Velebit	CROATIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST ENGINEERING												The eight toothed spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus) plays an important role in spruce forests of Croatia, in the same way as it does in the rest of Europe wherever spruce grows. The size and intensity of its outbreaks is considerably lower though, and compared with the majority of countries scoring huge timber losses, Croatian forestry in general is much less affected, both economically and ecologically, by this bark beetle. Mixed tree species composition, natural origin and uneven age structure of spruce stands surely adds to the less pronounced and sporadic outbreaks in the Croatian territory. The recent rise of bark beetle populations in general, and above than average attacks of this bark beetle in the central parts of Dinaric mountain chain, initiated some new, targeted research projects. In the northern part of the Velebit Mountain, in the spring of 2008, afield trial was set up aimed at investigating the overwintering strategy of the eight toothed spruce bark beetle on two experimental plots in different elevation zones. The core idea was to test the already described phenomenon of different hibernation niche choice within the northern dwelling populations (predominantly choosing forest litter) and southern populations (staying within their growing niche, under the spruce bark). The general objective of the research and the expected outcomes fall within the area of sanitation felling and mechanical procedures in a wider concept of integrated bark beetle suppression tactics that could be used by Croatian foresters. Each experimental plot was characterized by the freshly attacked group of spruce trees (last summer second generation of spruce bark beetle). The aerial distance between the lower "Stirovaca" plot (1080 meters a.s.l.) and the higher "Zavizan" plot (1404 meters a.s.l.) was 17.5 kilometers ensuring that the two were well separated in space. The altitudinal difference of 324 meters might not seem striking but climatic conditions in the area of experimental plots are quite different, notably in terms of temperature profile and height and duration of snow cover. On each experimental plot a set of forest floor eclectors was set up within the vicinity of standing spruces hit by the last summer bark beetle attack. Also, on each of the plots, one tree mounted cylindrical eclector was wrapped around the lower tree trunk of a standing spruce, collecting beetles emerging from the bark (details in Table 1, Fig. 2). In the close vicinity of the plots a pheromone trap was installed (commonly used Theysohn (R) type trap baited with Pheroprax (R) aggregation lure). The total area under the eclectors varied on the plots and the results of the collected beetles were interpreted accordingly, per unit of covered area. Beetles emerging in the eclectors and those trapped in the pheromone traps were collected on a weekly basis and counted in the laboratory. The trial started on April 19 and ended on June 9 covering fully the flight of the first, spring generation of spruce bark beetle. This statement is backed up by the parallel pheromone monitoring network data, which clearly confirm the onset and decline of the beetles spring swarm. The obtained results confirmed that the eight toothed spruce bark beetle does overwinter in the forest litter. The ratio between adults staying in their developmental sites (spruce bark) and those that entered forest litter varied in the two plots. In the higher plot the ratio was 50:50. The lower plot revealed a ratio of 60:40 in favor of beetles using bark instead of litter as an overwintering niche (Fig. 4). Assuming the altitudinal to zonal conversion concept, at least on a trend level, the obtained results correspond with the described tendency of south-north preference shift towards the forest litter as an overwintering niche. More importantly, the mere fact that after their full development in late summer/early fall, tenure adults of eight toothed spruce bark beetle enter litter, as confirmed by this research in a typical Croatian forest where spruce grows naturally, sheds new light on the efficiency of sanitation felling. The guidance tactics derived by this research dictate early logging operations, before the end of summer and in the period when beetles are still under the bark. This is especially important when stands are at higher elevations or grow in very harsh winter conditions in terms of temperature. Lower elevations, on the other hand, leave more time to sanitation logging, provided that the operations (removal of attacked trees) are finished before the onset of the beetle spring swarming. The efficiency of sanitation logging, as a part of the integrated bark beetle management, therefore, strongly depends on the proportion of the beetles overwintering in the forest litter. This might help to better understand the various efficiency and uneven impact of sanitation felling on bark beetle outbreak foci in the past in the Croatian spruce forests. Phenological data derived from the temporal analysis of bark beetle appearances in eclectors and pheromone lures (Fig. 3) also give some interesting and useful biological and forestry data. The recorded time lag of roughly two weeks between the start of emergence and peak pheromone trapped beetles on the two plots fits within the concept of the known zonal/altitudinal phenological shift. The practical value lies in the fact that it has been firstly recorded in more detail in one of the Croatian most important spruce growing region. Also, the documented time lag between the first emergers (both bark and forest litter) and first pheromone trapped beetles illustrates the known phenomenon of the first flight phase of the spruce bark beetle the dispersal flight. The reason why this time lag was longer in the lower plot and shorter in the higher plot is explained by the possible immigration of earlier emerged beetles in the lower elevations lured to the pheromone trap in the higher elevated plot. Also, the duration and dynamics of beetle emergence on both plots varies significantly and is related to climatic regime in the plot area, which was measured (temperature, dew point, absolute and relative humidity) but not presented in this paper. What is evident from the pheromone trap catches (Fig. 3) is the narrower curve of the flying period of the first generation beetles in the higher plot versus lengthier swarming period in the lower plot (two weeks versus two weeks). In our opinion the most important outcome of this research for the Croatian forestry practice is the confirmation that forest litter is an overwintering niche of the eight toothed spruce bark beetle. In spite of the geographical position, i.e. the south part of the common spruce and spruce bark beetle distribution, the Croatian forestry must take into account that a significant part of beetle population can be missed by early fall or spring during sanitation operations, consequently enabling the beetle outbreaks to continue at an unacceptable pace. From the entomological point of view, it would be interesting to continue the research deeper in terms of within the species variability of Croatian spruce bark beetle populations. Assuming the fact that these populations are genetically old and wide in ecological plasticity, it is reasonable to expect that they can easily adapt to changing climatic conditions, escaping the winter mortal subzero temperatures by shift in ratio of cohorts of beetles choosing bark or litter as their overwintering niche.

Justin			The Spatial Ecology of Chacma Baboons (Papio ursinus) in a Human-modified Environment	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY					23rd Congress of the International-Primatological-Society	SEP 12-17, 2010	Kyoto Univ, Kyoto, JAPAN	Int Primatol Soc	Kyoto Univ			Anthropogenic habitat alteration can have a dramatic effect on the spatial distribution and ranging patterns of primates. We characterized the spatial ecology of a free-living troop of chacma baboons (Papio ursinus) in a human-modified environment in the Cape Peninsula, South Africa. We used GPS and behavioral observations collected over 1 yr to quantify the troop's home range size, habitat selection, choice of sleeping site, and foraging patterns. The troop comprised 115 individuals living in a home range of 9.50 km(2), giving a density of 12.1 baboons/km(2). Area use correlates positively with exotic vegetation and negatively with indigenous vegetation and altitude. The troop spent significantly more time in low-lying human-modified environments, i.e., plantations, vineyards, and urban habitat, than in indigenous vegetation that was largely restricted to steeper slopes at higher elevations. The troop slept exclusively in exotic trees, 94% of which were located in the plantation, 3% in urban habitat, and 3% in vineyards. The most consumed food items were exotic grasses, subterranean food items, and exotic pine nuts. The survival and persistence of the focal troop in close proximity to the urban edge while >= 3 neighboring troops were previously extirpated suggests that access to low-lying land in conjunction with a land-use practice that does not preclude baboon presence has been fundamental to both their survival and persistence at such a high density. The almost exclusive use of exotic vegetation both as a food source and as a safe refuge for sleeping highlights the ecological flexibility of baboons, but the systematic loss of low-lying productive land poses the single greatest threat to their continued persistence on the Cape Peninsula.																	0164-0291	1573-8604				APR	2011	32	2					308	328		10.1007/s10764-010-9467-6								WOS:000289989100002						
J	Gibbs, M; Wiklund, C; Van Dyck, H				Gibbs, Melanie; Wiklund, Christer; Van Dyck, Hans			Temperature, rainfall and butterfly morphology: does life history theory match the observed pattern?	ECOGRAPHY												Butterfly distribution and abundance is known to be influenced by temperature and rainfall. What is not clear, however, is how life history and flight morphological traits are affected by changes in local weather conditions. During the period 1989-1999, we explored the effects of ambient temperature and rainfall during larval development on adult phenotypic traits (body mass, forewing loading, forewing surface area and forewing length) in a Swedish population of the speckled wood butterfly Pararge aegeria. As different seasonal cohorts correspond to different developmental pathways (larval hibernating, pupal hibernating and directly developing), we analysed these morphological time series relative to developmental pathway. Phenotypic variation in response to the temperature and rainfall levels experienced during larval development differed in both magnitude and direction depending on the developmental pathway, and hence seasonal cohort, examined (i.e. there was a pathway-specific response). We suggest that through its developmental flexibility P. aegeria may be able to adjust to variation in weather conditions over time. Other less flexible species, however, may not be so fortunately buffered. To truly estimate the impact of climate change on biodiversity more fine-scale, local studies are required that examine the mechanisms underlying the response of species to climate change.																	0906-7590	1600-0587				APR	2011	34	2					336	344		10.1111/j.1600-0587.2010.06573.x								WOS:000289150000016						
J	Hwang, WB; Shiao, SF				Hwang, Wenbe; Shiao, Shiuh-Feng			Dormancy and the influence of photoperiod and temperature on sexual maturity in Nicrophorus nepalensis (Coleoptera: Silphidae)	INSECT SCIENCE												Carrion beetles (Nicrophorus spp.) use small vertebrate carcasses for food and reproduction. Their ecology and behaviors are highly affected by the availability of carcasses and the surrounding environmental conditions. Our results revealed that in subtropical Fushan, northern Taiwan, N. nepalensis was mainly active in spring (February to May), and could also be found in autumn (October and November); but there was no capture record in summer (June to September) and winter (December and January). A laboratory temperature tolerance study indicated that N. nepalensis adults become inactive at temperatures above 26 degrees C, and had the highest mortality when the temperature was raised from 27 degrees C to 28 degrees C. Furthermore, N. nepalensis became sexually mature at 20 degrees C, depending on the photoperiod: the longer the day, the lower the percentage of sexually mature 2-week-old females after emergence. In another experiment, N. nepalensis virgins were paired under three possible conditions at Fushan. At 15 degrees C and 20 degrees C, if carcasses were presented to the pairs within 3 days after emergence, all laid eggs in the second week after emergence. If carcasses were presented 1 week after emergence, most began to reproduce at 20 degrees C with 12.5 h of daylight. However, at 15 degrees C with 11 h of daylight, the carrion beetles hibernated first, and reproduced in the ninth week after emergence. At 25 degrees C with 14 h of daylight, carrion beetles did not bury the mouse carcasses, the females did not lay eggs, and the adult lifespan was only one-third of that at 20 degrees C. This study revealed that both photoperiod and temperature influence the time needed to reach the sexual maturity of N. nepalensis; and also implied that the narrow temperature tolerance range and dormancy behavior of carrion beetles are highly regulated by those environmental factors.

Here, we show that an externally applied electrochemical potential can reversibly activate the copper catalyst for this process by a one-electron reduction of an initially added air-stable cupric species (Cu-II/Ligand). Modulation of polymerization kinetics is thereby tunable in real time by varying the magnitude of applied potential. Application of multistep intermittent potentials successfully triggers initiation of polymerization and subsequently toggles the polymerization between dormant and active states in a living manner. Catalyst concentrations down to 50 parts per million are demonstrated to maintain polymerization control manifested in linear first-order kinetics, a linear increase in polymer molecular weight with monomer conversion, and narrow polymer molecular weight distributions over a range of applied potentials.

We measured metabolic enzyme activity in terrapin muscle tissue to assess thermal dependence and the role of temperature in seasonal metabolic downregulation in this species. Activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), pyruvate kinase (PK), citrate synthase (CS), and cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) was assayed at 10, 20, 30, and 40 degrees C for tissue collected during summer and winter. The Q(10) for enzyme activity varied between 1.31 and 2.11 within the temperature range at which terrapins were active (20-40 degrees C). The Q(10) for LDH, CS, and CCO varied between 1.39 and 1.76 and between 10 and 20 degrees C, but PK exhibited heightened thermal sensitivity within this lower temperature range, with a Q(10) of 2.90 for summer-collected tissue and 5.55 for winter-collected tissue. There was no significant effect of season on activity of LDH or PK, but activity of CS and CCO was significantly lower in winter-collected tissue compared with summer-collected tissue. Results indicate that temperature effects contribute to seasonal metabolic downregulation and dormancy in terrapins, but other environmental factors (i.e. oxygen availability), as well as seasonal shifts in blood biochemistry and circulating hormones may also play an important role.

Adaptive evolution of the Populus tremula photoperiod pathway	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Perennial plants monitor seasonal changes through changes in environmental conditions such as the quantity and quality of light and genes in the photoperiodic pathway are known to be involved in controlling these processes. Here, we examine 25 of genes from the photoperiod pathway in Populus tremula (Salicaceae) for signatures of adaptive evolution. Overall, levels of synonymous polymorphism in the 25 genes are lower than at control loci selected randomly from the genome. This appears primarily to be caused by lower levels of synonymous polymorphism in genes associated with the circadian clock. Natural selection appears to play an important role in shaping protein evolution at several of the genes in the photoperiod pathways, which is highlighted by the fact that approximately 40% of the genes from the photoperiod pathway have estimates of selection on nonsynonymous polymorphisms that are significantly different from zero. A surprising observation we make is that circadian clock-associated genes appear to be over-represented among the genes showing elevated rates of protein evolution; seven genes are evolving under positive selection and all but one of these genes are involved in the circadian clock of Populus.

J	Idaszkin, YL; Bortolus, A				Idaszkin, Yanina L.; Bortolus, Alejandro			Does low temperature prevent Spartina alterniflora from expanding toward the austral-most salt marshes?	PLANT ECOLOGY												Along the Atlantic coast of South America, the northern salt marshes (lower than 43A degrees S) are dominated by Spartina species while the southern salt marshes (greater than 43A degrees S) are dominated by Sarcocornia perennis. The most abundant Spartina species are Spartina densiflora which is present in most coastal marshes, and Spartina alterniflora that was never recorded above the similar to 42A degrees 25'S. It is not clear why S. alterniflora has not succeeded in the southern marshes, in which the low marsh zone remains as an extensive bared mud flat. We address the hypothesis that the absence of S. alterniflora in the south is driven by the cold temperatures inversely related with increasing latitudes along the East coast of Patagonia. To evaluate this hypothesis, we carried out an experiment in which we manipulated the temperature in combination with frost formation and photoperiod. We found that cold temperature produced a negative effect on S. alterniflora, and this effect seems accentuated by the frost but not by the reduction in the photoperiod. Our results support the hypothesis that the absence of S. alterniflora in the southernmost salt marshes of Patagonia is a consequence of the frost as an outcome of the co-occurrence of low temperature and high humidity. The importance of our results are discussed in the context of the global warming and how Spartina species enlarge their distributional range toward higher latitudes.																	1385-0237	1573-5052				APR	2011	212	4					553	561		10.1007/s11258-010-9844-4								WOS:000288557700003

Only few freshwater snail species transmit the rat lungworm Angiostrongylus cantonensis, which is partially explained by the low likelihood of contact between snails and infected rat faeces. The snail Pomacea canaliculata was introduced into China in 1981 and has become the key intermediate host for A. cantonensis. Thus far, the snail has been recorded in 13 provinces of southern China. 2. We developed a biological model and assessed potential impacts of climate change on the distribution of P. canaliculata and hence the transmission of A. cantonensis. Mean January temperature and snail generation intensity (generation number) were identified as the key factors determining P. canaliculata distribution. Our models predict an increase of 56.9% for the 'spread' and a decrease of 40.9% for the 'establishment' regions ('spread' and 'establishment' defined according to a national sampling survey) by the 2030s relative to the present day. 3. Key determinants of A. cantonensis transmission were identified as the generation intensity in the intermediate host, the longevity of A. cantonensis-infected rats and the dormant period of P. canaliculata. Transmission of A. cantonensis occurs only in areas where the snail's dormant period is < 173.2 days. The potential endemic area of A. cantonensis is predicted to double by the 2030s relative to the present day. 4. The tight fit of our model predictions with data derived from a national sampling survey suggests that biological models hold promise for assessing potential impacts of climate change on infectious diseases once key determinants have been established. Geographical variation analysis may offer an approach to identify areas prone to the spread of vectors, intermediate hosts and parasites in a future warmer China and elsewhere.																	0046-5070					APR	2011	56	4					717	734		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2011.02579.x								WOS:000288019200007

Spatial Ecology and Factors Influencing Movement Patterns of Desert Massasauga Rattlesnakes (Sistrurus catenatus edwardsii) in Southeastern Colorado	COPEIA												The Massasauga Rattlesnake (Sistrurus catenatus) occurs from extreme southeastern Canada to northern Mexico, and most populations are highly threatened due to habitat loss and fragmentation. Although their range is reduced from historical levels, they may be locally abundant in appropriate habitat. We studied movement patterns, home range and core activity centers, habitat use, and prey abundance in a robust population of Desert Massasauga Rattlesnakes (S. c. edwardsii) in southeastern Colorado by radiotracking 36 snakes over four active seasons (May-October). In the spring, snakes made long-distance directed movements (mean = 1.89 km) from the hibernacula (shortgrass, compacted clay soils) to summer foraging areas (mixed-grass/Sand Sagebrush, sandhills). Summer activity was characterized by short distance non-directional movements, and snakes were most often observed at the base of Sand Sagebrush (Artemisia filifolia). Home ranges and core activity centers were significantly larger for males than for females, but daily movements, total distance moved, and range length did not differ significantly between sexes. Prey base surveys indicated a significantly higher abundance of both rodents and lizards in summer foraging grounds than at hibernation sites. Snakes returned to the hibernaculum area in October and appeared to hibernate individually in rodent burrows. Migration patterns exhibited by S. c. edwardsii are likely resource driven, with the migratory movements observed in the spring resulting in utilization of summer foraging habitat with more abundant prey. Conversely, hibernacula with greater thermal and structural stability in the shortgrass habitat (perhaps due to the compacted clay soils versus loose sandy soils) favor migratory return for torpor in the fall. At present, the main populations in Colorado occur far from developing regions in the state, but due to habitat loss and fragmentation resulting from projected agricultural expansion and urbanization, these populations may be threatened in the future.																	0045-8511	1938-5110				MAR 14	2011		1					29	37		10.1643/CE-09-122								WOS:000288889400004

A Synthetic Peptide Shows Retro- and Anterograde Neuronal Transport before Disrupting the Chemosensation of Plant-Pathogenic Nematodes	PLOS ONE												Cyst nematodes are a group of plant pathogens each with a defined host range that cause major losses to crops including potato, soybean and sugar beet. The infective mobile stage hatches from dormant eggs and moves a short distance through the soil to plant roots, which it then invades. A novel strategy for control has recently been proposed in which the plant is able to secrete a peptide which disorientates the infective stage and prevents invasion of the pathogen. This study provides indirect evidence to support the mechanism by which one such peptide disrupts chemosensory function in nematodes. The peptide is a disulphide-constrained 7-mer with the amino acid sequence CTTMHPRLC that binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. A fluorescently tagged version of this peptide with both epifluorescent and confocal microscopy was used to demonstrate that retrograde transport occurs from an aqueous environment along bare-ending primary cilia of chemoreceptive sensilla. The peptide is transported to the cell bodies of these neurons and on to a limited number of other neurons to which they connect. It appears to be localised in both neuronal processes and organelles adjacent to nuclei of some neurons suggesting it could be transported through the Golgi apparatus. The peptide takes 2.5 h to reach the neuronal cell bodies. Comparative studies established that similar but less abundant uptake occurs for Caenorhabditis elegans along its well studied dye-filling chemoreceptive neurons. Incubation in peptide solution or root-exudate from transgenic plants that secrete the peptide disrupted normal orientation of infective cyst nematodes to host root diffusate. The peptide probably undergoes transport along the dye-filling non-cholinergic chemoreceptive neurons to their synapses where it is taken up by the interneurons to which they connect. Coordinated responses to chemoreception are disrupted when the sub-set of cholinergic interneurons secrete the peptide at synapses that have post-synaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.																	1932-6203					MAR 7	2011	6	3							e17475	10.1371/journal.pone.0017475								WOS:000288099800016	21408216

Actual and potential distribution of Acrolepiopsis assectella (Lepidoptera: Acrolepiidae), an invasive alien pest of Allium spp. in Canada	CANADIAN ENTOMOLOGIST												Acrolepiopsis assectella (Zeller), leek moth, is a widespread and common pest of species of Allium L. (Liliaceae) in the western Palaearctic subregion. The establishment of A. assectella in eastern North America has resulted in economic losses to garlic (Allium sativum L.), leek (Allium porrum L.), and onion (A ilium cepa L.) growers, especially to organic producers in eastern Ontario and southern Quebec. Acrolepiopsis assectella was first recorded in the Ottawa area in 1993. By 2010, A. assectella had expanded its range into eastern Ontario, southwestern Quebec, Prince Edward Island, and New York. A bioclimate model, using CLIM EX simulation software, was developed to produce mapped results that closely approximated known distributions for A. assectella in central Europe. This model was then validated with recorded distribution records in eastern Europe, Asia, and North America. Model output predicted that A. assectella will readily survive in southeastern Canada and the eastern United States of America. Other areas potentially suitable for A. assectella include coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest, the interior of southern British Columbia, and north-central Mexico. The continued range expansion of A. assectella into other Allium-growing areas of eastern North America appears to be inevitable. Establishment in these areas presents the risk of substantial production losses to Allium spp. producers.																	0008-347X					MAR-APR	2011	143	2					185	196		10.4039/n10-058								WOS:000297389900007

Circumventing the requirement of PRC2 in endosperm allowed us to generate viable homozygous null mutants for FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT ENDOSPERM (FIE), which is the single Arabidopsis homolog of Extra Sex Combs, an indispensable component of Drosophila and mammalian PRC2. Here we show that H3K27me3 deposition is abolished genome-wide in fie mutants demonstrating the essential function of PRC2 in placing this mark in plants as in animals. In contrast to animals, we find that PRC2 function is not required for initial body plan formation in Arabidopsis. Rather, our results show that fie mutant seeds exhibit enhanced dormancy and germination defects, indicating a deficiency in terminating the embryonic phase. After germination, fie mutant seedlings switch to generative development that is not sustained, giving rise to neoplastic, callus-like structures. Further genome-wide studies showed that only a fraction of PRC2 targets are transcriptionally activated in fie seedlings and that this activation is accompanied in only a few cases with deposition of H3K4me3, a mark associated with gene activity and considered to act antagonistically to H3K27me3. Up-regulated PRC2 target genes were found to act at different hierarchical levels from transcriptional master regulators to a wide range of downstream targets. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that PRC2-mediated regulation represents a robust system controlling developmental phase transitions, not only from vegetative phase to flowering but also especially from embryonic phase to the seedling stage.

Climate-induced increase of moth multivoltinism in boreal regions	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim An increase in multivoltinism in ectothermic animals has been proposed by several authors as a possible outcome of climate warming, especially in high latitudes. We tested this prediction with large-scale empirical monitoring data for boreal moth communities. Location Finland, northern Europe. Methods Our data set comprised observations of multivoltine species made in the Finnish moth monitoring scheme 'Nocturna' trap sites during the period 1993-2006 along an exceptionally long latitudinal gradient of 1000 km. To compare recent changes in moth multivoltinism with a longer time period, we gathered older time series of moth observations from five locations. We used generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) to detect possible temporal and geographical trends in the annual occurrence of multivoltinism. We also identified areas where the recent changes in multivoltinism have been greatest. Monthly average temperatures of spring and summer periods and annual sum of growing degree days above 5 degrees C (GDD5) were used as explanatory variables to distinguish the main climatic correlates of moth multivoltinism. Results We observed a clear increase in the occurrence of moth multivoltinism during the period 1993-2006. The incidence as well as the recent increase in multivoltinism were highest in southernmost Finland and decreased towards the north. We also detected a weaker, although significantly positive, trend of moth multivoltinism in southern Finland during the period 1963-92, suggesting that this increasing trend might already have begun earlier. The most important climatic correlates for the annual occurrence of moth multivoltinism were the mean summer temperature (periods May-July and June-August) and GDD5, but all the tested climatic variables showed a significant univariate relationship with the occurrence of moth multivoltinism. All climatic variables showed an increasing trend during the period 1993-2006. Main conclusions The occurrence of multivoltinism has increased in northern European moth communities during recent decades, apparently as a response to increasing temperatures during the spring and summer seasons. The increase in multivoltinism was greatest in the southernmost parts of Finland, whereas in the northern landscapes recent warming has triggered multivoltinism in only relatively few moth species.

Fatigue of steel in air at low cyclic loading frequency	SCRIPTA MATERIALIA												This investigation was aimed at studying crack growth behaviour at extremely low loading frequencies of steels exhibiting low temperature creep. It was found that crack dormancy at low loading frequency is an intrinsic characteristic of the steels. Frequency can be an independent driving force, like the stress intensity factor range (Delta K) and the maximum stress intensity factor (K(max)), in low cyclic loading frequency regimes. A dormant state or threshold condition can be achieved by reducing loading frequency. (C) 2010 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Although we know a great deal about the genetic basis of flowering phenology in model species under controlled conditions, the genetic architecture of this ecologically important trait is poorly understood in nonmodel organisms. Here, we evaluated the transition from vegetative growth to flowering in Boechera stricta, a perennial relative of Arabidopsis thaliana. We examined flowering time QTLs using 7920 recombinant inbred individuals, across seven laboratory and field environments differing in vernalization, temperature, and photoperiod. Genetic and environmental factors strongly influenced the transition to reproduction. We found directional selection for earlier flowering in the field. In the growth chamber experiment, longer winters accelerated flowering, whereas elevated ambient temperatures delayed flowering. Our analyses identified one large effect QTL (nFT), which influenced flowering time in the laboratory and the probability of flowering in the field. In Montana, homozygotes for the native allele at nFT showed a selective advantage of 6.6%. Nevertheless, we found relatively low correlations between flowering times in the field and the growth chambers. Additionally, we detected flowering-related QTLs in the field that were absent across the full range of laboratory conditions, thus emphasizing the need to conduct experiments in natural environments.

Activity-dormancy transition in the cambial meristem involves stage-specific modulation of auxin response in hybrid aspen	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												The molecular basis of short-day-induced growth cessation and dormancy in the meristems of perennial plants (e.g., forest trees growing in temperate and high-latitude regions) is poorly understood. Using global transcript profiling, we show distinct stage-specific alterations in auxin responsiveness of the transcriptome in the stem tissues during short-day-induced growth cessation and both the transition to and establishment of dormancy in the cambial meristem of hybrid aspen trees. This stage-specific modulation of auxin signaling appears to be controlled via distinct mechanisms. Whereas the induction of growth cessation in the cambium could involve induction of repressor auxin response factors (ARFs) and down-regulation of activator ARFs, dormancy is associated with perturbation of the activity of the SKP-Cullin-F-box(TIR) (SCF(TIR)) complex, leading to potential stabilization of repressor auxin (AUX)/indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) proteins. Although the role of hormones, such as abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellic acid (GA), in growth cessation and dormancy is well established, our data now implicate auxin in this process. Importantly, in contrast to most developmental processes in which regulation by auxin involves changes in cellular auxin contents, day-length-regulated induction of cambial growth cessation and dormancy involves changes in auxin responses rather than auxin content.

Spatial ecology of a ubiquitous Australian anteater, the short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus)	JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY												The only specialized ant-eating mammal in Australia and New Guinea is the egg-laying short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus), and this single species occurs throughout Australia in a wide range of habitats. Despite the diversity of habitats and density and distribution of prey species, home-range sizes throughout Australia seem remarkably similar. We radiotracked echidnas in a population in Tasmania over a 13-year period and calculated home-range sizes using the fixed kernel method and the minimum convex polygon method. No relationship was found between body mass and home-range size, and mean annual home-range size of males (90% kernels) was 107 ha +/- 48 SD, twice that of females (48 +/- 28 ha). Male home ranges overlapped considerably and also overlapped with those of several females. The echidna follows the pattern seen in many solitary eutherian mammals: both sexes are promiscuous, and males have larger home ranges than females. Echidnas show a high degree of home-range fidelity but can make rare excursions out of their normal area. Hibernating echidnas move between shelters during their periodic arousals, resulting in home-range sizes similar to those of the active period. Consistent with their very low metabolic rate, echidnas have home-range sizes considerably smaller than predicted for carnivorous or omnivorous mammals. Examination of data from other ant-eating mammals shows that as a group anteaters not only have smaller than predicted home ranges but they depart significantly from the normal relationship between home-range size and body mass.

J	Nakao, S				Nakao, Shiro			Geographical variation of photoperiodic wing form determination and genetic background of reproductive diapause in arrhenotokous populations of Thrips nigropilosus Uzel (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) in Japan	APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY												To determine the level of inter-population variation in wing form and the induction of reproductive diapause as affected by photoperiod, females of five populations of arrhenotokous Thrips nigropilosus Uzel were reared under four different photoperiodic conditions at 18 degrees C. The experimental populations originated from Nakijin-son, Motobu-cho, and Uruma-shi in Okinawa Island, Amami-shi in Amami-Oshima Island, and Wakayama-shi on Honshu Island. In all five populations, only macropterae were observed when the photoperiod was 13 h light/11 h dark. Brachypterae were observed as the light period was reduced to 11.5 or 12 h in the Wakayama population, and to 10 or 11.5 h in the Nakijin, Motobu, and Uruma populations. Brachypterous females were observed in the Amami population only when the light period was 10 h. With the same photoperiod, only brachypterae were observed in the Wakayama and Uruma populations. Short-day conditions also induced reproductive diapause in the Wakayama population but not in the Amami and Okinawa Island populations. Under 10 h light/14 h dark, almost all hybrids obtained from crossing Wakayama with Amami populations entered reproductive diapause. Some populations in Okinawa Island may have been originated in northern localities.																	0003-6862					FEB	2011	46	1					111	116		10.1007/s13355-010-0016-8								WOS:000289895700016

Thermal biology and establishment potential in temperate climates of the aphid parasitoid, Lysiphlebus testaceipes	BIOCONTROL												Lysiphlebus testaceipes (Cresson) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae, Aphidiinae) is a parasitic wasp which plays an important role in the biological control of a number of aphid species. Through assessment of its thermal biology and low temperature tolerance, this study ascertains the establishment potential of L. testaceipes in cool temperate climates typical of northern Europe. The developmental threshold of L. testaceipes was 5.8A degrees C. Rearing of parasitoids at shorter day lengths and lower temperatures indicated no ability to enter a diapause state. The supercooling points (SCP) of non-acclimated and acclimated parasitoid life stages were between -24.6A degrees C and -17.7A degrees C, with LTemp(50) temperatures approaching these values, indicating a high level of cold tolerance in short exposures. At 5A degrees C the LTime(50) of acclimated larvae within parasitized aphids was 42.8 days. Acclimated pupae continued to develop with 54% adult emergence from mummies within 60 days. Acclimated parasitoid larvae and pupae, within living and mummified aphids, continued to develop during 70 days of winter field exposure and emerging adult parasitoids were reproductively viable under field conditions. These data indicate that where suitable host species are available throughout the year, L. testaceipes would be able to establish in northern Europe.																	1386-6141					FEB	2011	56	1					19	33		10.1007/s10526-010-9314-x								WOS:000285874000003

Photosynthesis of Lolium perenne L. at low temperatures under low irradiances	ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY												To develop mechanistic models for winter survival of grasses under climate change, more knowledge is needed of photosynthetic activity at low irradiance and temperature. Photosynthetic activity of small stands of Lolium perenne was continuously studied for up to two weeks under low photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) in the air temperature range from -3 degrees C to +9 degrees C. The photosynthetic rate of plants growing at 2, 6 and 9 degrees C was similar at 120 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) PPFD but the rate increased with increasing PPFD at all temperatures, particularly 9 degrees C. Light saturation of photosynthesis was reached at approx. 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) at 2 and 6 degrees C, and at approx. 600 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) at 9 degrees C. At 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), the CO2 exchange rate (CER) at 2 degrees C was approx. 60% of that at 9 degrees C. When the temperature increased gradually from 0 degrees C at start to +5 degrees C at the end of the 8-h photoperiod, CER decreased by about 20% compared with that at constant 5 degrees C. Changing the temperature from constant +5 degrees C to a diurnal variation between -2 and +2 degrees C gradually decreased daytime CER to approx. 10% after five days, partly due to leaf area losses (similar to 50% loss) when the poorly acclimatised plants were exposed to frost. At start of the photoperiod at -2 degrees C CER was negative, but became slightly positive when temperature exceeded -1 degrees C after two hours. Total daily photosynthesis was negative due to night-time respiration in this treatment. Soil heating to avoid freezing when the diurnal air temperature fluctuated between -3 and +3 degrees C had no effect on CER at this low PPFD level (150 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). In contrast to the -2/+2 degrees C treatment, total daily photosynthesis was slightly positive in the -3/+3 degrees C treatment, where the plants were better acclimatised to frost. Increasing the CO2 concentration from 350 to 600 mu mol mol(-1) had no effect on CER at 2 and 6 degrees C, but increased it by 20% at 9 degrees C. The data indicate that the minimum temperature for photosynthesis in the cultivar studied is about -4 degrees C. The results can be applied in different photosynthesis models. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Live fast, die young: flexibility of life history traits in the fat-tailed dwarf lemur (Cheirogaleus medius)	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY												The fat-tailed dwarf lemur, Cheirogaleus medius, occurs in ecologically very different habitat types (rainforest and dry forest) across Madagascar. Its extraordinary biological characteristics, such as monogamy and long-term hibernation, allow us to investigate behavioral, ecological, and physiological flexibility of this species in populations across different ecological environments. This study aims to determine whether different life history and physiological traits show variation in adaptation to the differing ambient conditions or are conservative and influenced more by the organism's evolutionary history. We compared body masses, life history traits, social organization, and hibernation duration of two populations of C. medius, one from a littoral rainforest and one from the dry deciduous forest. We revealed clear geographical differences in the length of hibernation duration as well as, more surprisingly, in life history traits. We found that this species' reproductive strategies seem to be highly flexible. Animals in the rainforest can spend more time in the active state due to a shorter hibernation period, but have, in general, a shorter life expectancy due to higher mortality rates. Hence, they seem to maximize their total reproductive output with higher reproductive rates (larger litter sizes, greater number of litters). Home ranges and social organization, on the other hand, did not vary between habitats, suggesting that the general requirements of this species are independent of environmental conditions. In conclusion, some life history traits, formerly assumed to be genetically fixed parameters of primate species, prove in fact to be highly flexible. Different populations of the same species show distinct adaptations according to the prevailing conditions in order to maximize individual reproductive output.

Rapid Cold Hardening and Expression of Heat Shock Protein Genes in the B-Biotype Bemisia tabaci	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												This paper describes the rapid cold hardening processes of the sweetpotato whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius). It was found that all developmental stages of B. tabaci have the capacity of rapid cold hardening and the length of time required to induce maximal cold hardiness at 0 degrees C varies with stage. There was only 18.3% survival when adult whiteflies were transferred directly from 26 degrees C to -8.5 degrees C for 2 h. However, exposure to 0 degrees C for 1 h before transfer to -8.5 degrees C increased the survival to 81.2%. The whiteflies show "prefreeze" mortality when they were exposed to temperatures above the supercooling point (SCP), although the range of SCP of whiteflies is -26 degrees C to -29 degrees C. The rapid cold hardening had no effect on SCP and reduced the lower lethal temperature of adults from -9 degrees C to -11 degrees C. Rapid cold-hardened adults had a similar lifespan as the control group but deposited fewer eggs than nonhardened individuals. The expression profiles during cold hardening and recovery from this process revealed that HSP90 did not respond to cold stress. However, HSP70 and HSP20 were significantly induced by cold with different temporal expression patterns. These results suggest that the rapid cold hardening response is possibly advantageous to whiteflies that are often exposed to drastic temperature fluctuations in spring or autumn in northern China, and the expression of HSP70 and HSP20 may be associated with the cold tolerance of B. tabaci.																	0046-225X	1938-2936				FEB	2011	40	1					132	139		10.1603/EN09357								WOS:000287541700019	22182622

Divergent Egg Physiologies in Two Closely Related Grasshopper Species: Taeniopoda eques versus Romalea microptera (Orthoptera: Romaleidae)	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												We compared egg survivorship and egg development time at different soil moistures for two closely related grasshopper species from divergent habitats: marsh-inhabiting Roma lea microptera (Beauvois) versus desert-inhabiting Taeniopoda eques (Burmeister). These two species can interbreed and produce viable offspring. In nature, both species have a similar 8-9 mo subterranean egg stage, but their soil environments differ dramatically in water content. We predicted that the eggs of the two species would exhibit differential survivorship and development times under different moisture levels. Our laboratory results show that the eggs of both species survived a wide range of soil moistures (approximate to 0.5 to 90%), maintained for 3 mo. However, the eggs of the marsh grasshopper, R. microptera, better tolerated the highest soil moistures (95 and 100%), whereas the eggs of the desert species, T. eques, better tolerated the lowest soil moistures (0.0 and 0.1%). Sixty-five percent of marsh-inhabiting R. microptera eggs, but no desert T. eques eggs, survived 3 mo submersion under water. In contrast, 49% of desert T. eques eggs, but only 3.5% of R. microptera eggs, survived after being laid into oven-dried sand and then maintained with no additional water until hatch. In the laboratory at 26 degrees C, the two species differed significantly in the mean length of the oviposition-to-hatch interval: 176 d for R. microptera versus 237 d for T. eques. These divergent traits presumably benefit these insects in their divergent habitats. Our results suggest the evolution of physiological divergence that is consistent with adaptations to local environments.																	0046-225X					FEB	2011	40	1					157	166		10.1603/EN10200								WOS:000287541700022	22182625					
J	Augustine, DJ				Augustine, David J.			Habitat Selection by Mountain Plovers in Shortgrass Steppe	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Much of the breeding range for the mountain plover (Charadrius montanus) occurs in shortgrass steppe and mixed-grass prairie in the western Great Plains of North America. Studies of mountain plovers in shortgrass steppe during the 1970s and 1990s were focused in Weld County, Colorado, which was considered a key breeding area for the species. These studies, however, did not include habitats influenced by black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) or prescribed fire. The role of these 2 rangeland disturbance processes has increased substantially over the past 15 years. During 2008-2009, I used radial distance point count surveys to estimate mountain plover densities early in the nesting season in 4 habitats on public lands in Weld County, Colorado. All 4 habitats were grazed by cattle during the growing season at moderate stocking rates but had different additional disturbances consisting of 1) dormant-season prescribed burns, 2) active black-tailed prairie dog colonies, 3) black-tailed prairie dog colonies affected by epizootic plague in the past 1-2 years, and 4) rangeland with no recent history of fire or prairie dogs. Mountain plover densities were similar on active black-tailed prairie dog colonies ((X) over bar = 6.8 birds/km(2), 95% CI = 4.3-10.6) and prescribed burns ((X) over bar = 5.6 birds/km(2), 95% CI = 3.5-9.1). In contrast, no plovers were detected at randomly selected rangeland sites grazed by cattle but lacking recent disturbance by prairie dogs or fire, even though survey effort was highest for this rangeland habitat. Mountain plover densities were intermediate (2.0 birds/km(2), 95% CI = 0.8-5.0) on sites where black-tailed prairie dogs had recently been extirpated by plague. These findings suggest that prescribed burns and active black-tailed prairie dog colonies may enhance breeding habitat for mountain plovers in shortgrass steppe and illustrate the potential for suppressed or altered disturbance processes to influence habitat availability for declining wildlife species.

Photoperiod as a proximate factor in control of seasonality in the subtropical male Tree Sparrow, Passer montanus	FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY												Background: Most species of birds exhibit well-defined seasonality in their various physiological and behavioral functions like reproduction, molt, bill color etc. such that they occur at the most appropriate time of the year. Day length has been shown to be a major source of temporal information regulating seasonal reproduction and associated events in a number of avian species. The present study aims to investigate the role of photoperiod in control of seasonal cycles in the subtropical male tree sparrow (Passer montanus) and to compare its responses at Shillong (Latitude 25 degrees 34'N, Longitude 91 degrees 53'E) with those exhibited by its conspecifics and related species at other latitudes. Results: Initial experiment involving study of seasonal cycles revealed that the wild tree sparrows posses definite seasonal cycles of testicular volume, molt and bill color. These cycles were found remarkably linked to annual solar cycle suggesting the possibility of their photoperiodic control. To confirm this possibility in the next experiment, the photosensitive birds were exposed to three different light-dark regimes that were close to what they experience at this latitude: 9L/15D (close to shortest day length), 12L/12D (equinox day length) and 14L/10D (close to longest day length) for 18 months. Tree sparrows showed testicular growth followed by regression and development of photorefractoriness, molting and bill color changes only under long daily photoperiods (12 L and 14 L) but not under short daily photoperiod (9 L). Birds, under stimulatory photoperiods, did not show reinitiation of the above responses after the completion of initiation regression cycle even after their exposure to these photoperiods for 18 months. This precludes the possibility of circannual rhythm generation and suggests the involvement of photoperiodic mechanism in control of their seasonal cycles. Further, replacement of body and primary feathers progressed with gonadal regression only under long days suggesting that the two high energy demanding events of reproduction and molt are phased at two different times in the annual cycle of the bird and are photoperiodically regulated. Results of the final experiment involving exposure of photosensitive birds to a variety of photoperiodic treatments (9L/15D, 10L/14D, 11L/13D, 12L/12D, 14L/10D and 16L/8D) for 30 days suggested that the light falling for 11 h or more is important in inducing testicular growth and function in this species. Conclusion: These results clearly indicate that despite of small photofluctuation, subtropical tree sparrows are capable of fine discrimination of photoperiodic information and use day length as a proximate environmental factor to time their seasonal responses similar to their conspecifics and related species at other latitudes suggesting the conservation of photoperiodic control mechanism in them.																	1742-9994					JAN 11	2011	8								1	10.1186/1742-9994-8-1								WOS:000286524300001	21223557

Phenotypic plasticity of flying-fox reproduction aligns the genome-encoded rhythm to environmental conditions	BIOLOGY AND CONSERVATION OF AUSTRALASIAN BATS					Symposium on the Biology and Conservation of Australasian Bats	APR 12-14, 2007	Sydney, AUSTRALIA	Royal Zool Soc New S Wales, Australasian Bat Soc				Timing of seasonal reproduction by flying-foxes is apparently dependent on an endogenous circannual rhythm, coded in their genome. Ultimately, evolution of an endogenous rhythm aligns an important reproductive stage, such as lactation, with resource availability such as the occurrence of maximum plant productivity; animals then do not have to rely on proximate factors to predict conditions nine months in advance. External influences that re-align reproduction to match a phase-shift in environmental conditions have to either adjust the period of the biological clock, or else induce a phase-shift, to bring breeding back into line with prevailing conditions. These are non-genomic factors: they influence the expression of genes, and therefore phenotype, without altering the DNA. Stages of reproduction relate temporally with the endogenous rhythm, but individual flying-foxes may need to make fine adjustments in their own timing. To do this they probably monitor a suite of environmental conditions. It has been proposed that if a signal changed in isolation from other factors it would be ignored. For example, it is important that a nomadic species be not directly responsive to photoperiod since this differs when they move between latitudes. A reproductive stage would, however, be inhibited if several cues warned against proceeding, e.g. inadequate forage combined with long commuting distances at a time of unfavourable temperatures. What non-genomic factors regulate flying-fox reproduction? It is likely that rainfall is part of the regulation for the overall rhythm, while current energy balance is probably important for individual animals during many stages of their reproduction.																			978-0-98-3272-4-3				2011							146	154										WOS:000306448900015

Despite this, a limited number of studies have examined mature beech tree growth outside their natural distribution range in relation to meteorological parameters and air pollution. The present study aimed to detect sensitivity of beech tree growth not only to meteorological conditions but also one of the most phytotoxic pollutants - surface ozone in Lithuania by using dendrochronological method. Data set since 1980 of surface ozone was available from Preila EMEP station, and enables to analyze integrated effect meteorology and surface ozone on beech growth variation over the last 30 year period. The obtained results revealed that hot summers, dry and cold dormant and first half of vegetation periods resulted in beech tree growth reduction. However, due to climate changes warmer dormant periods and rather stable temperatures of summers should increase the tolerance of beech trees to unfavorable lack of humidity in the first half of vegetation. Surface ozone having negative effect on beech tree growth due to stabilization in its concentration should not decrease beech tree stem increment. If changes in the considered parameters continue following the last 10 year period scenarios, the intensity of Beech tree growth in Lithuania should increase.																	1822-3230						2011	5	2					21	25										WOS:000304698500003

Prussian foresters promoted European beech in western and south-western parts of Lithuania in the nineteenth century by planting these trees in Scots pine stands. This forest management practice ensured beech migration towards north-east, what resulted in arising of the new issues concerning sensitivity of European beech to current environmental changes, in areas outside their natural distribution range. Dendrochronological analysis of these trees revealed that wormer dormant period and precipitation amount over the entire year positively affected beech tree growth in Lithuania. Only the effect of summer air temperature on beech tree ring formation demonstrated different significance, i.e. on the seaside summer air temperature positively resulted in tree ring width, meanwhile in the central part of Lithuania - negatively. Further investigation in this field will allow explain this difference in beech growth formation and sensitivity to summer heat in Lithuania. Despite this we can conclude that seaside and south-western parts of Lithuania are rather favourable for beech growth under the changing climate conditions in Lithuania.																	1822-3230						2011	5	2					106	110										WOS:000304698500019

Technologically important extremophile 16S rRNA sequence Shannon entropy and fractal property comparison with long term dormant microbes	INSTRUMENTS, METHODS, AND MISSIONS FOR ASTROBIOLOGY XIV	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Instruments, Methods, and Missions for Astrobiology XIV	AUG 23-25, 2011	San Diego, CA	SPIE				Technologically important extremophiles including oil eating microbes, uranium and rocket fuel perchlorate reduction microbes, electron producing microbes and electrode electrons feeding microbes were compared in terms of their 16S rRNA sequences, a standard targeted sequence in comparative phylogeny studies. Microbes that were reported to have survived a prolonged dormant duration were also studied. Examples included the recently discovered microbe that survives after 34,000 years in a salty environment while feeding off organic compounds from other trapped dead microbes. Shannon entropy of the 16S rRNA nucleotide composition and fractal dimension of the nucleotide sequence in terms of its atomic number fluctuation analyses suggest a selected range for these extremophiles as compared to other microbes; consistent with the experience of relatively mild evolutionary pressure. However, most of the microbes that have been reported to survive in prolonged dormant duration carry sequences with fractal dimension between 1.995 and 2.005 (N = 10 out of 13). Similar results are observed for halophiles, red-shifted chlorophyll and radiation resistant microbes. The results suggest that prolonged dormant duration, in analogous to high salty or radiation environment, would select high fractal 16S rRNA sequences. Path analysis in structural equation modeling supports a causal relation between entropy and fractal dimension for the studied 16S rRNA sequences (N = 7). Candidate choices for high fractal 16S rRNA microbes could offer protection for prolonged spaceflights. BioBrick gene network manipulation could include extremophile 16S rRNA sequences in synthetic biology and shed more light on exobiology and future colonization in shielded spaceflights. Whether the high fractal 16S rRNA sequences contain an asteroid-like extra-terrestrial source could be speculative but interesting.																	0277-786X		978-0-81948-762-9				2011	8152								81520T	10.1117/12.893450								WOS:000296107200021

EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY: CONCEPTS, BIODIVERSITY, MACROEVOLUTION AND GENOME EVOLUTION					14th Evolutionary Biology Meeting	SEP 21-24, 2010	Marseilles, FRANCE					In regulating their seasonal flowering, plants have adapted to many environmental inputs including daylength, temperature, and light intensity. Adaptation to temperature alone explains flowering of Pimelea ferruginea (King et al. 1992), a Western Australian perennial shrub. In the laboratory, plants from the 650 km of its north south coastal distribution show clinal adaptation for thermoregulated flowering: those from higher latitudes require cooler temperatures (15 degrees C) than the more equatorial ones (21 degrees C). This adaptation confers evolutionary advantage because, in reciprocal field transplant nurseries, all lines flowered after a cool field winter (13-15 degrees C), but those originating from cooler sites failed to flower at the warmest (17-19 degrees C) extreme of its latitudinal distribution. Thus, thermoregulated flowering of P. ferruginea provides an adaptive advantage. A less extreme response is evident in Crowea exalata, another Australian shrub. Increased temperature linearly reduces its flower numbers (16% loss per 3 degrees C) and causes earlier flowering. Clearly, a 3-4 degrees C global warming will restrict flowering and sometimes cause species extinction.																			978-3-642-20762-4				2011							139	149		10.1007/978-3-642-20763-1_9								WOS:000293822500009

Changes in phytohormones and oxidative stress markers in buried seeds of Vellozia alata	FLORA												Little information is still available on the mechanisms underlying seed persistence in the soil in several species, and most particularly in vegetation of the rupestrian fields of the Espinhaco Range in Brazil, where ca. 90% of their species are endemic and are of interest for conservation biology. Here we aimed at examining the putative physiological and biochemical changes seeds of one of this species (Vellozia alata L.B.Sm., Velloziaceae) may experience after burial under natural conditions. Endogenous concentrations of phytohormones and oxidative stress markers were measured in seeds buried in the soil for 12 months. Buried seeds experienced a significant loss of germination capacity, which decreased from 58 to 29% during the first 6 months. This was associated with a decline in gibberellins (by 65%), abscisic acid (by 98%), cytokinins (up to 75%) and jasmonic acid (by 97%) during the first 3 months, while salicylic acid increased at 6 months of burial. Malondialdehyde and tocopherol levels also decreased dramatically to non-detectable values during this period, while all tocotrienol homologues decreased by 30%. By contrast, germination capacity remained constant around 30% between 6 and 12 months of burial. During this period, concentrations of all phytohormones examined remained unaltered, except for salicylic acid, whose levels returned to initial values. Tocotrienols decreased significantly, particularly between 9 and 12 months of burial, while the extent of lipid peroxidation remained constant. It is concluded that in V. alata, (i) seed burial causes dramatic changes in phytohormones and in the extent of lipid peroxidation, while the potential for germination decreases; (ii) after 6 months of burial, seed germination capacity remains constant, at least until one year, which is associated with absence of oxidative damage.

RANGE EXTENSION OF THE NORTHERN CRAYFISH, ORCONECTES VIRILIS (DECAPODA, CAMBARIDAE), IN THE WESTERN PRAIRIE PROVINCES OF CANADA	CRUSTACEANA												The northern crayfish, Orconectes virilis (Hagen, 1870), is the northernmost-ranging crayfish species in North America. However, little is known of the distribution of O. virilis in the western Prairie Provinces of Canada, which comprise the northwestern portion of the species' contiguous range. We combined extensive sampling data with confirmed reports of crayfish to describe a recent westward range expansion and the current distribution of O. virilis in Saskatchewan and Alberta. The reports suggest that the vast majority of colonization of the western Prairie Provinces may have resulted from natural movement, although anthropogenic introduction may be, in part, responsible for the described expansion of O. virilis. The description of potential movement patterns and current range has implications for the continued monitoring and management of the species across the region.

J	Michaelsen, TC; Jensen, KH; Hogstedt, G				Michaelsen, Tore Christian; Jensen, Knut Helge; Hogstedt, Goran			Topography is a limiting distributional factor in the soprano pipistrelle at its latitudinal extreme	MAMMALIAN BIOLOGY												Climatic conditions such as temperature and seasonality are becoming increasingly harsh towards the latitudinal extreme of the distribution and may limit the occurrence of mammals through decreased food availability or accessibility. For nocturnal bats increasing day length in summer may also limit the range latitudinally. We investigated the effect of long term mean temperature, precipitation, altitude, water affinity, terrestrial habitat, and topography on the summer distribution of the soprano pipistrelle Pipistrellus pygmaeus at its northern limit in western Norway (62 degrees N, 06'E) in a fiord landscape. We recorded presence/absence of the species in 138 sites by means of ultrasound detectors (and an acoustic lure). A binary logistic regression analysis showed that temperature is significant in predicting occurrence of soprano pipistrelles, with no animals in areas of less than 13 degrees C (long term mean July temperature). Further, the model suggests that the species prefers areas where steep mountains to the north shade out the sun before sunset and after sunrise. Here soprano pipistrelles can start hunting up to 2 h earlier than in a flat landscape, thus spending more time on energy consumption. (C) 2010 Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Saugetierkunde.

J	Dlugos, MJ; Wilcox, RS				Dlugos, Michael J.; Wilcox, R. Stimson			Altitudinal differentiation of reproductive tactic plasticity despite the close proximity of two Aquarius remigis populations	BEHAVIOUR												In the water strider (Aquarius remigis), direct and delayed reproductive tactics are largely canalized in southern and northern areas of North America, respectively. A transition zone occurs in upstate New York, defined as the area where lowland striders plastically express either tactic based on photoperiod and food abundance cues. We tested whether these cues similarly influence tactics among higher altitude transition zone populations. We compared the proportion of direct reproducers from a high altitude stream (HAS) and a low altitude stream (LAS) reared under low and high food abundance, as well as a normal and late-solstice photoperiod. With sexes combined, higher proportions of direct reproducers were found among LAS striders, and among striders reared in the late solstice photoperiod and high food abundance treatments. Among males, a food abundance x stream interaction was significant, suggesting greater canalization of reproductive tactics among HAS males. Among females, photoperiod was a significant factor, but did not interact with stream of origin. Field measurements showed that water surface temperatures and food abundance were lower in HAS compared to LAS. These conditions, as well as shorter season lengths, likely select against direct reproduction among HAS striders, possibly resulting in the observed canalization of reproductive tactics.																	0005-7959						2011	148	2					265	282		10.1163/000579511X555269								WOS:000288105500006

Summer variability, winter dormancy: lichen activity over 3 years at Botany Bay, 77 degrees S latitude, continental Antarctica	POLAR BIOLOGY												Lichens make up a major component of Antarctic vegetation; they are also poikilohydric and are metabolically active only when hydrated. Logistic constraints have meant that we have little idea of the length, timing or environmental conditions of activity periods of lichens. We present the results of a three-year monitoring of the activity of the lichen Umbilicaria aprina at Botany Bay (77A degrees S latitude) in the Ross Sea region, continental Antarctica. Chlorophyll fluorescence parameters that allowed hydrated metabolic activity to be detected were recorded with a special fluorometer at 2- or 3-h intervals. Air and thallus temperatures and incident PPFD (photosynthetic photon flux density, mu mol photon m(-2) s(-1)) were also recorded at hourly intervals. Activity was extremely variable between months and years and, overall, lichen was active for 7% of the 28-month period. Spring snow cover often delayed the onset of activity. Whereas the period immediately after snow melt was often very productive, the later months, January to March, often showed low or no activity. Mean thallus temperature when active was just above zero degrees and much higher than the annual mean air temperature of -15 to -19A degrees C. Because major snow melts occurred when incident radiation was high, the lichen was also subjected to very high PPFD when active, often more than 2,500 mu mol photon m(-2) s(-1). The major environmental stress appeared to be high light rather than low temperatures, and the variability of early season snow fall means that prediction of activity will be very difficult.

Existing production facilities may be re-used for injection. Uncertainties in storage capacity, injection rates and time of availability require an analysis of the feasibility of storing CO2 at the rates currently projected for the period 2015 - 2050. This paper investigates the availability of storage capacity and the feasibility of injecting CO2 at the rate that current capture scenarios foresee. The cost of storage in depleted gas fields is estimated, assuming either re-use of existing installations or the construction of new platforms and wells. Unit cost of storage, non-discounted, in the range of 10 (sic)/tCO(2) is feasible for larger fields; costs for small fields are estimated to range up to 40 (sic)/tCO(2). Constructing new, dedicated facilities is not always the more expensive option, due to sometimes long hibernation times and higher operational cost of existing facilities. Two capture scenarios are used for the Rotterdam and Amsterdam areas, with captured volumes increasing to 25 Mt/yr or 40 Mt/yr. In both cases, injection rate limitations become apparent when 70 - 75% of the storage capacity is used, which is around 2055 and 2045, respectively. To ensure continuity of storage, alternatives for storage in offshore gas fields need to be in place by then.

D. reticulatus host-seeking activity was observed between the end of March at 5 degrees C temperature and 89% humidity, and the beginning of December at 6 degrees C temperature and 92% humidity. The peak autumn activity found between September - November was more than 2-fold higher than the spring peak, which occurred between April - May. The activity of females, males, and the total number of adult ticks was correlated with the temperature (p<0.01) and photoperiod (p<0.01); additionally, no dependency was found between adult tick activity and humidity of the environment (p>0.05). Females predominated throughout almost the entire activity period, but the ratios between females and males varied in the particular seasons. Males predominated only after the activity of adult ticks ceased between June - second decade of August, which was related to the reproductive processes. The investigations demonstrated that the activity dynamics in D. reticulatus from eastern Poland is similar to that in the southern European population, but different from that in the north-eastern Polish, Russian and West European populations. This indicates a need to monitor the threats of diseases transmitted by D. reticulatus within different regions of its range of geographic distribution.																	1232-1966						2011	18	2					340	344										WOS:000298829200031	22216810					
J	Harel, D; Holzapfel, C; Sternberg, M				Harel, Danny; Holzapfel, Claus; Sternberg, Marcelo			Seed mass and dormancy of annual plant populations and communities decreases with aridity and rainfall predictability	BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY												Several theoretical and empirical studies have examined the influence of environmental conditions on seed traits and germination strategies of annual species. A positive relationship between seed mass and dormancy has been described for annuals occupying climatically unpredictable ecosystems. Larger-seeded species tend to have higher seedling survival rates, while dormancy allows a bet-hedging strategy in unpredictable environments. Until now, these ideas have been addressed primarily for only one or a few focal species, without considering differences among populations and communities. The novelty of the present study lies in the population and community-level approach, where a comprehensive seed trait database including 158 annual species occurring along a gradient of rainfall variability and aridity in Israel was used to ask the following question: Does average seed mass and dormancy of annual populations and communities decrease with increasing aridity and rainfall unpredictability? Soil seed bank samples were collected at the end of the summer drought, before the onset of the rains, from four plant communities. Germination was tested under irrigated conditions during three consecutive germination seasons to determine the overall seed germinability in each soil sample. Seed mass was obtained from newly produced seeds collected at the study sites in late spring. The community level results showed that, in contrast to common theoretical knowledge, seed mass and dormancy of the dominant annual species decreased with increasing aridity and rainfall variability. Accordingly, a negative correlation was found between seed mass and seed germination fractions. The present study demonstrates that an analysis of seed traits along climatic gradients is significantly improved by approaches that target both population and community levels simultaneously. A critical evaluation sheds new light upon the selective pressures that act on seed ecology of annuals along a climatic gradient and facilitates formulation of more mechanistic hypotheses about factors governing critical seed traits.																	1439-1791						2011	12	8					674	684		10.1016/j.baae.2011.09.003								WOS:000299187500004

Those living at relatively high latitude, such as Canada, Spain, and Italy (44 degrees N-45 degrees N), and born in the fall tended to be "morning-type" persons in comparison to those born in other seasons. There are relatively little data on the affect of season of birth on people residing at low latitude. Here the authors show that at low latitude, Kochi, Japan (33 degrees N), the effect of season of birth on the morningness chronotype is confined to young children aged 1-12 yrs, disappearing in elderly persons. Only female participants aged 2-12 yrs born in the fall, especially in November, were significantly morning-typed (p < .001) in comparison to those born in the other seasons, whereas there were no such significant season-of-birth differences in morningness-eveningness preference among male participants. Moreover, both female and male participants aged 13-25 yrs showed no significant seasonal differences in morningness-eveningness preference. The small effects detected in this study might be due to smaller seasonal change in day length at the relatively lower latitude of Kochi.

J	Kauhala, K; Kowalczyk, R				Kauhala, Kaarina; Kowalczyk, Rafal			Invasion of the raccoon dog Nyctereutes procyonoides in Europe: History of colonization, features behind its success, and threats to native fauna	CURRENT ZOOLOGY												We aimed to review the history of the introduction and colonization of the raccoon dog Nyctereutes procyonoides in Europe, the features behind its successful expansion and its impact on native fauna. The raccoon dog quickly colonized new areas after being introduced to the European part of the former Soviet Union. Today it is widespread in Northern and Eastern Europe and is still spreading in Central Europe. Features behind its success include its adaptability, high reproductive potential, omnivory, hibernation in northern areas, multiple introductions with > 9000 individuals from different localities, and tendency to wander enabling gene flow between populations. Firm evidence of the raccoon dog's negative impact on native fauna, such as a reduction in bird populations, is still scarce. Raccoon dogs may destroy waterfowl nests, although a nest predation study in Latvia did not confirm this. Predator removal studies in Finland suggested that the raccoon dog's impact on game birds is smaller than expected. However, raccoon dogs may have caused local extinction of frog populations, especially on islands. Raccoon dogs may compete with other carnivores for food, for example for carrion in winter, or for the best habitat patches. In northern Europe potential competitors include the red fox Vulpes vulpes and the badger Meles meles, but studies of their diets or habitat preferences do not indicate severe competition. The raccoon dog is an important vector of diseases and parasites, such as rabies, Echinococcus multilocularis and Trichinella spp. and this is no doubt the most severe consequence arising from the spread of this alien species in Europe [Current Zoology 57 (5): 584-598, 2011].																	1674-5507						2011	57	5					584	598		10.1093/czoolo/57.5.584								WOS:000293343700004

Diapause is an important life history trait that should be taken into account when planning biological control in temperate regions. Diapause in N. californicus is highly variable across the global range. However, little is known to the Korean population of N. californicus. We studied the diapause induction of the N. californicus population originated from the southern island of Jeju, which is the only part of the country where N. californicus naturally occurs. Diapause induction was tested under the combination conditions of four constant temperatures (15, 18, 21, and 24 degrees C) and five photoperiods (6:18, 8:16, 10:14, 12:12, and 14:10 (L:D) h) with one or two generation exposures. Results showed that adult females in every treatment oviposited, indicating that diapause was not induced under these conditions. The preoviposition period was longer at lower temperatures (5.7 +/- 0.23 d at 15 degrees C) and gradually shortened as temperature increased (1.1 d +/- 0.04 at 24 degrees C). Reproduction and prey egg consumption were higher as temperature increased.

Individual Eurasian siskins Carduelis spinus can breed and winter in widely separated areas in different years. Birds at different latitudes will experience different changes in photoperiod. So how does latitude affect photoperiodic control? Our aim in this study was to find whether Siskins caught from the wild in Britain and exposed to different photoperiodic regimes, typical of widely separated latitudes, would differ in the subsequent timing and duration of their moults and associated processes. Siskins were caught in late February and early March, and initially kept outside on natural photoperiods. From the spring equinox (21 March), they were divided into three groups kept under photoperiodic regimes that simulated latitudes 40 degrees, 55 degrees and 70 degrees N respectively. All three groups showed highly significant subsequent changes in body mass, fat scores and cloacal protuberance size. Moult of the primary feathers started during June - August (mean 9 July), and lasted 61-99 days (mean 75 days). Birds that started to moult late in the season had shorter moult durations. All individuals showed lower mass and fat levels during moult than before or after moult. Crucially, there were no significant differences in the timing of these events between the three photoperiodic groups. Apparently these birds did not use prevailing absolute photoperiod or the prevailing rate of change in photoperiod to time moult-related seasonal events, but used instead some other feature of the annual photoperiod cycle or some form of interval timer linked to photoperiod.

J	Vesala, L; Hoikkala, A				Vesala, Laura; Hoikkala, Anneli			Effects of photoperiodically induced reproductive diapause and cold hardening on the cold tolerance of Drosophila montana	JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY												Coping with seasonal and daily variation in environmental conditions requires that organisms are able to adjust their reproduction and stress tolerance according to environmental conditions. Females of Drosophila montana populations have adapted to survive over the dark and cold winters at high latitudes and altitudes by spending this season in photoperiodically controlled reproductive diapause and reproducing only in spring/summer. The present study showed that flies of a northern population of this species are quite tolerant of low temperatures and show high seasonal and short-term plasticity in this trait. Culturing the flies in short day length (nearly all females in reproductive diapause), as well as allowing the flies to get cold hardened before the cold treatment, increased the cold tolerance of both sexes both in chill coma recovery time test and in mortality assay. Chill coma recovery time test performed for the females of two additional D. montana populations cultured in a day length where about half of the females enter diapause, also showed that diapause can increase female cold tolerance even without a change in day length. Direct linkage between diapause and cold tolerance was found in only two strains representing a high-altitude population of the species, but the phenomenon will certainly be worth of studying in northern and southern populations of the species with larger data sets.

Physiological and biological patterns of a highland and a coastal population of the European cherry fruit fly during diapause	JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY												Adult emergence of univoltine temperate insect species and its synchronization with specific host phenological stages is mainly regulated by obligatory pupal diapause. Although a few studies have investigated the factors affecting diapause intensity, little attention has been paid to the physiological alterations and metabolic regulation that take place during diapause. Here, we describe differences in diapause between a highland and a coastal Greek population of the European cherry fruit fly Rhagoletis cerasi, a major pest of sweet and sour cherries in many European countries. Pupae of both populations were exposed to the environmental conditions prevailing in the two areas and diapause termination was observed under laboratory conditions. The regulation of energetic metabolites during the long pupae stage was examined under both field and laboratory conditions. Differences in diapause intensity revealed that the two populations have adapted to the local geographical and climatic conditions and have different requirements for low temperatures to terminate diapause. The coastal population undergoes a shorter diapause and adults emerge more rapidly, especially in the highland area. The highland population failed to terminate diapause (<40% adult emergence) in the coastal area. Both populations draw on their major energetic reserves (lipids and protein) similarly during diapause. Nevertheless, regulation of carbohydrate and glycogen reserves seems to vary between the populations: major peaks of these stored nutrients occur on different dates in the two populations, suggesting a differential regulation. Differences in diapause intensity imply a genetic differentiation between the two populations. The importance of our findings in understanding the physiological patterns during obligatory diapause of a univoltine insect species, as well as the practical implications for the development of specific phenological models for the European cherry fruit fly are discussed.

J	Ji, RB				Ji, Rubao			Calanus finmarchicus diapause initiation: new view from traditional life history-based model	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Organisms have evolved to optimally align the timing of diapause with the seasonality of environmental conditions in order to maximize their fitness. Observations from the Northwest Atlantic suggest that Calanus finmarchicus diapause initiation date varies significantly by geographic location, inconsistent with patterns of seasonal changes of any single environmental factor such as photoperiod, sea surface temperature, or food availability. In the present study, a life history-based model was used to reconcile the apparent inconsistency. The model results suggest that (1) the induction of diapause involves multiple environmental factors as a result of fitness maximization, and (2) in addition to temperature and food condition, predation pressure is another key factor that could affect diapause initiation process. It is further suggested that phenotypic plasticity is likely to be the major source of variation in the timing of diapause initiation for C. finmarchicus.

Addition of inorganic or organic phosphorus enhances nitrogen and carbon fixation in the oligotrophic North Pacific	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												We present a spatially extensive record of dinitrogen (N-2) fixation rates and distributions of N-2 fixing microorganisms along with the results of exogenous phosphorus (P) addition experiments conducted during a series of cruises in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG). We measured the N-2 and carbon (C) fixation rates of natural plankton assemblages in response to the addition of methylphosphonate (MPn), a dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) compound, and dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP). Results are compared to parallel unamended controls. These experiments produced 3 major findings: (1) MPn and DIP were utilized with equal metabolic efficiency over a single photoperiod, (2) the bulk of the enhanced N-2 fixation rates were within the range of those previously reported in the NPSG, suggesting that P levels in this region can be saturating but were not at the time of sampling and (3) MPn and DIP additions stimulated C fixation rates beyond estimated contributions by diazotrophs, and hence both DIP and bioavailable DOP additions could lead to enhancement of net primary productivity on short time-scales. Our results suggest that the rate of N-2 fixation in our study region may have been restricted by the availability and/or the composition of the total P pool (inorganic and organic P) during our field season.

The effect of temperature on hatch and activity of second-stage juveniles of the root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne minor, an emerging pest in north-west Europe	NEMATOLOGY												Meloidogyne minor is a serious threat to turfgrass in north-west Europe, and has a broad host range that includes other economically important plants. The species was described only recently and little is known about its biology. This study examines the effect of temperature on hatch and motility of second-stage juveniles (J2), and records hatching from egg masses collected from golf greens in different seasons. Eggs were present throughout the year and a high percentage hatch (46-88%) was recorded when they were incubated at 20 degrees C. When egg masses were incubated at constant temperatures, J2 hatched between 15 and 25 degrees C, with limited hatch (<1%) at 10 and 30 degrees C. The percentage hatch was lower at 15 degrees C (43%) than at 20-25 degrees C (63-76%). J2 hatched fastest at 23 degrees C, with an average duration to hatching of 7 days compared to 17 days at 15 degrees C. The range of temperatures at which J2 was active was broader than that at which they hatched. J2 were active from 4-30 degrees C, with greatest activity between 15 and 25 degrees C. The addition of grass root extract temporarily increased J2 activity at 10-20 degrees C, but not at lower temperatures.																	1388-5545						2011	13		8				985	993		10.1163/138855411X571902								WOS:000298162200010

Component species have presumably evolved to maintain appropriate phenologies under historical climates, but cases of inappropriate phenology can be expected with climate change. Understanding controls on phenology permits predictions of ecological responses to climate change. We studied phenological control systems in Lepidoptera by analyzing flight times recorded at a network of sites in Finland. We evaluated the strength and form of controls from temperature and photoperiod, and tested for geographic variation within species. Temperature controls on phenology were evident in 51% of 112 study species and for a third of those thermal controls appear to be modified by photoperiodic cues. For 24% of the total, photoperiod by itself emerged as the most likely control system. Species with thermal control alone should be most immediately responsive in phenology to climate warming, but variably so depending upon the minimum temperature at which appreciable development occurs and the thermal responsiveness of development rate. Photoperiodic modification of thermal controls constrains phenotypic responses in phenologies to climate change, but can evolve to permit local adaptation. Our results suggest that climate change will alter the phenological structure of the Finnish Lepidoptera community in ways that are predictable with knowledge of the proximate physiological controls. Understanding how phenological controls in Lepidoptera compare to that of their host plants and enemies could permit general inferences regarding climatic effects on mid- to high-latitude ecosystems.

PLANT SPECIES BIOLOGY												Wet forest ecosystems in temperate regions have been heavily drained and logged, often with significant negative consequences for biodiversity in these habitats. Our research focused on population maintenance mechanisms of a declining wet forest sedge Carex loliacea L. We studied germination under different light regimes and seedling survival under different vegetation densities using an in situ removal experiment. For successful germination, seeds of C. loliacea need light; germination in reduced light conditions is depressed. The seeds of C. loliacea are able to accumulate a seed bank and exhibit seasonal dormancy cycles. Survival of seedlings strongly depends on competition with other plant species. Our results imply that changes in habitat conditions (draining, forest cutting) affect the successful generative reproduction of C. loliacea primarily via a change in light conditions, which is a strong factor both at the stage of germination and seedling growth. However, adult plants are able to persist over a much broader range of habitat conditions without detectable vitality loss.

Clock polymorphism in Pacific salmon: evidence for variable selection along a latitudinal gradient	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Seasonal timing of life-history events is often under strong natural selection. The Clock gene is a central component of an endogenous circadian clock that senses changes in photoperiod (day length) and mediates seasonal behaviours. Among Pacific salmonids (Oncorhynchus spp.), seasonal timing of migration and breeding is influenced by photoperiod. To expand a study of 42 North American Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) populations, we tested whether duplicated Clock genes contribute to population differences in reproductive timing. Specifically, we examined geographical variation along a similar latitudinal gradient in the polyglutamine domain (PolyQ) of OtsClock1a and OtsClock1b among 53 populations of three species: chum (Oncorhynchus keta), coho (Oncorhynchus kisutch) and pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha). We found evidence for variable selection on OtsClock1b that corresponds to latitudinal variation in reproductive timing among these species. We evaluated the contribution of day length and a freshwater migration index to OtsClock1b PolyQ domain variation using regression trees and found that day length at spawning explains much of the variation in OtsClock1b allele frequency among chum and Chinook, but not coho and pink salmon populations. Our findings suggest that OtsClock1b mediates seasonal adaptation and influences geographical variation in reproductive timing in some of these highly migratory species.

Seventy-two sites distributed around the globe were evaluated following the standardized sampling protocol of the Census of Marine Life NaGISA project (www.nagisa.coml.org). There were no clear patterns of standardized estimators of species richness along latitudinal gradients or among Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs); however, a strong latitudinal gradient in taxonomic composition (i.e., proportion of different taxonomic groups in a given sample) was observed. Environmental variables related to natural influences were strongly related to the distribution patterns of the assemblages on the LME scale, particularly photoperiod, sea surface temperature (SST) and rainfall. In contrast, no environmental variables directly associated with human influences (with the exception of the inorganic pollution index) were related to assemblage patterns among LMEs. Correlations of the natural assemblages with either latitudinal gradients or environmental variables were equally strong suggesting that neither neutral models nor models based solely on environmental variables sufficiently explain spatial variation of these assemblages at a global scale. Despite the data shortcomings in this study (e. g., unbalanced sample distribution), we show the importance of generating biological global databases for the use in large-scale diversity comparisons of rocky intertidal assemblages to stimulate continued sampling and analyses.

The life cycle of V. dahliae includes three vegetative phases: parasitic, saprophytic and dormant. The dormant microsclerotia are the primary infectious propagules, which germinate when they are stimulated by root exudates. In this study, we report the first application of Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT) for construction of insertional mutants from a virulent defoliating isolate of V. dahliae (V592). Changes in morphology, especially a lack of melanized microsclerotia or pigmentation traits, were observed in mutants. Together with the established laboratory unimpaired root dip-inoculation approach, we found insertional mutants to be affected in their pathogenicities in cotton. One of the genes tagged in a pathogenicity mutant encoded a glutamic acid-rich protein (VdGARP1), which shared no significant similarity to any known annotated gene. The vdgarp1 mutant showed vigorous mycelium growth with a significant delay in melanized microsclerotial formation. The expression of VdGARP1 in the wild type V529 was organ-specific and differentially regulated by different stress agencies and conditions, in addition to being stimulated by cotton root extract in liquid culture medium. Under extreme infertile nutrient conditions, VdGARP1 was not necessary for melanized microsclerotial formation. Taken together, our data suggest that VdGARP1 plays an important role in sensing infertile nutrient conditions in infected cells to promote a transfer from saprophytic to dormant microsclerotia for long-term survival. Overall, our findings indicate that insertional mutagenesis by ATMT is a valuable tool for the genome-wide analysis of gene function and identification of pathogenicity genes in this important cotton pathogen.

J	Iverson, JB				Iverson, John B.			Reproduction in the Red-Cheeked Mud Turtle (Kinosternon scorpioides cruentatum) in Southeastern Mexico and Belize, with Comparisons Across the Species Range	CHELONIAN CONSERVATION AND BIOLOGY												Reproduction in the red-cheeked mud turtle (Kinosternon scorpioides cruentatum) was studied in southeastern Mexico and Belize (Yucatan Peninsula) on the basis of museum and field-collected specimens. Adult females (mean carapace length [CL] = 110 mm) were not significantly larger than adult males (mean CL = 108 mm). Females matured at 100-105 mm CL and an estimated age of 9-10 years. Annual reproduction by females was apparently continuous for at least 10 months of the year (August-June), with the production of multiple annual clutches (possibly as many as 5) being typical and the number of clutches per year increasing with female size. Eggs exhibit diapause and embryonic estivation and apparently hatch in nature during the wet season (June-August) after up to 9 months in the nest. Modal clutch size was only 2 eggs (mean 2.2; range 1-4), and clutch size increased with female body size. Egg size averaged 31.5 X 16.6 mm and 5.5 g and did not vary with female body size. Relative egg mass (REM = mean egg mass X 100/[body mass 2 clutch mass]) averaged 2.3, was lower in larger clutches, and decreased with increased body size. Relative clutch mass (RCM = REM X clutch size) averaged 4.85, similar to that for the sympatric K. creaseri (4.5), the 2 lowest values reported for any studied Kinosternon population. RCM did not vary with female body size or clutch size. Females devote a relatively constant proportion of body mass to each clutch, and increases in reproductive output with size and age are apparently accomplished by increases in clutch size (but not egg size) and clutch frequency. This unusual suite of reproductive traits (small body size, small clutch size, production of up to 5 clutches per year, reduced relative clutch mass, and embryonic diapause and estivation) may have been instrumental in the success of this species at colonizing more of South America than any other Mesoamerican turtle genus or species and in less than 4 million years.																	1071-8443	1943-3956				DEC	2010	9	2					250	261		10.2744/CCB-0827.1								WOS:000285966500012

Development, consumption rates and reproductive biology of Orius albidipennis reared on various prey	BIOCONTROL												The predatory bug Orius albidipennis (Reuter) (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae) has tremendous potential as a biological control agent, especially in its native range around the Mediterranean Basin and East Africa. The need to exploit native biological control agents is growing in importance as concerns over the introduction of non-native species continue to increase. However, little is known of the effects of different prey on development and reproduction of O. albidipennis compared with other species of Orius. Therefore, we compared the development, survival, reproductive biology, and prey consumption of O. albidipennis when fed eggs of Ephestia kuehniella Zeller, Tetranychus urticae Koch, and Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Westwood), and larvae of Gynaikothrips ficorum (Marchal), under laboratory of 26 +/- 1 degrees C, 60 +/- 10% RH and 16L:8D photoperiod. Individuals were reared from the neonate stage until death on one of the four prey types. The type of prey had profound effects on all measured performance traits. The highest survival rate was recorded for nymphs that were fed on E. kuehniella eggs, while the lowest survival rate was observed for those fed on T. vaporariorum eggs. The shortest nymphal period was recorded for nymphs fed on E. kuehniella eggs, while the longest was measured for those fed on T. urticae eggs. During the nymphal period, O. albidipennis consumed significantly more eggs of T. urticae than other prey types, whereas the lowest number of consumed prey were eggs of E. kuehniella. Adult females and males consumed significantly more T. urticae eggs than other types of prey. However, Orius albidipennis females showed the highest fecundity when fed on E. kuehniella eggs, and the lowest when fed on T. vaporariorum eggs. Adult females and males that fed on G. ficorum larvae had significantly longer life spans compared with those fed other prey. Because of their relatively rapid development and high fecundity, O. albidipennis fed E. kuehniella eggs had a significantly higher net reproductive rate (R-o) and intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)) than O. albidipennis fed other prey types. Overall, eggs of E. kuehniella were the most suitable diet for nymphs and adults of O. albidipennis. Although less suitable, O. albidipennis could survive and reproduce on the other prey types, which is a favourable attribute in biological control agents. These results on the effect of different prey types on development and reproduction of O. albidipennis will also contribute to the development of mass rearing programs for biological control agents in developing countries, such as Egypt.

Geographic Variation in Diapause Induction: The Grape Berry Moth (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae)	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												Diapause in insects occurs in response to environmental cues, such as changes in photoperiod, and it is a major adaptation by which insects synchronize their activity with biotic resources and environmental constraints. For multivoltine agricultural insect pests, diapause initiation is an important consideration in management decisions, particularly toward the end of the growing season. The grape berry moth, Paralobesia viteana (Clemens), is the main insect pest affecting viticulture, and this insect responds to postsummer solstice photoperiods to initiate diapause. Because the range of grape berry moth extends from southern Canada to the southern United States, different populations are exposed to different photoperiodic regimes. We quantified the diapause response in grape berry moth populations from Arkansas, Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Virginia, and observed latitudinal variation in diapause initiation. Populations from Michigan, New York, and Pennsylvania responded significantly different than those from Arkansas, Texas, and Virginia. We also observed, as a consequence of our experiments, that the timing of our laboratory studies influenced grape berry moth's response to photoperiod, ceteris paribus. Experiments that were conducted when grape berry moth would be naturally in diapause resulted in a significant higher proportion of diapausing pupae at photoperiods (i.e., >15 h) that generally do not induce diapause, suggesting that attention should be paid to the timing of behavioral and physiological experiments on insects. This relationship between photoperiod and diapause induction in grape berry moth across geographic regions will provide applicable knowledge to improve pest management decisions.

Snakes that were surgically implanted with radiotransmitters were tracked during late spring of each year and located most days until the onset of hibernation in mid-November. Data were divided into summer and fall for seasonal analysis. Most home-range estimates and associated measures were significantly smaller during fall. Banded watersnakes used shoreline and littoral zone habitats in excess of their availability and used open water and terrestrial habitats relatively infrequently. Shoreline habitats were used more often during the fall, whereas littoral zone habitats were used more in the summer. Movement frequency was high relative to what has been reported for other Nerodia species.

We show that 55% of the area within seven western states was potential breeding range based on: (1) the occurrence of milkweed host plant species with phenology making them available during late-summer and (2) regional thermal conditions supportive of adult reproductive activity and development of immature stages. We next used a series of spatially explicit "bottom-up" regression models to test this first-approximation natal origins distribution. We tested for associations between variation in moisture availability at putative natal habitat and inter-annual variation in monarch abundance at western wintering sites for a 10 year period (1998-2007). Variation in moisture availability, as measured by Palmer's drought severity index (PDSI), across the western region predicted monarch abundance patterns. In contrast and as expected, PDSI across known eastern breeding grounds did not predict variation in western monarch migrant abundance. The pattern of moisture availability was not uniform between states or within states and permitted similar tests of association at a finer geographical level. PDSI for California, Idaho, Nevada, and Oregon (but not Arizona, Utah, or Washington) were each significantly associated with monarch wintering abundance patterns with California exhibiting the strongest relationship. At a more focused spatial scale we tested the local recruitment hypothesis. This is the notion that western coastal wintering monarch populations derive only from nearby coastal breeding habitat and that monarchs do not migrate from more distant natal grounds. Variation in moisture availability within a block of three contiguous central California climate divisions (Sacramento Drainage, San Joaquin Drainage, and Southeast Desert Basin) significantly predicted inter-annual abundance of migrant generation monarchs. In contrast PDSI patterns of three coastal California climate divisions, i.e., ones local to wintering sites, as well as that of climate divisions in western Nevada and Arizona did not predict variation in monarch abundance at this more focused spatial resolution. Our findings suggest that moisture regimes act as a strong bottom-up driver of monarch abundance pattern via resource availability in western USA.																	1366-638X	1572-9753				DEC	2010	14	6					731	744		10.1007/s10841-010-9303-5								WOS:000284073800014

(Heteroptera: Pentatomidae) close to the species' northern range limit in Japan. Insects are reared from October to June under quasi-natural (i.e. ambient outdoor) conditions and in a transparent incubator, in which climate warming is simulated by adding 2.5 degrees C to the ambient temperatures. Despite the earlier assumption that females of N. viridula overwinter in diapause, whereas males do so in quiescence, regular dissections show that the two sexes overwinter in a state of true diapause. During winter, both sexes are dark-coloured and have undeveloped reproductive organs. Resumption of development does not start until late March. During winter, the effect of simulated warming on the dynamics and timing of physiological processes appears to be limited. However, the warming significantly enhances winter survival (from 27-31% to 47-70%), which is a key factor in range expansion of N. viridula. In spring, the effect of simulated warming is complex. It advances the post-diapause colour change and transition from dormancy to reproduction. The earlier resumption of development is more pronounced in females: in April, significantly more females are already in a reproductive state under the simulated warming than under quasi-natural conditions. In males, the tendency is similar, although the difference is not significant. Warming significantly enhances spring survival and percentage of copulating adults, although not the percentage of ovipositing females and fecundity. The results suggest that, under the expected climate-warming conditions, N. viridula will likely benefit mostly as a result of increased winter and spring survival and advanced post-diapause reproduction. Further warming is likely to allow more adults to survive the critical cold season and contribute (both numerically and by increasing heterogeneity) to the post-overwintering population growth, thus promoting the establishment of this species in newly-colonized areas.

The parental origins were confirmed with a maternally inherited mitochondrial marker that distinguishes trees of the Northern European range from those of the Central European range. The seedlings from the families of Central European mother trees producing seeds in Norway had on average a bud set more similar to the families of local Norwegian origin producing seeds at the same site than the provenance of the same Central European origin. It is argued that the rapid change in this adaptive trait from one generation to the next can be explained by recent research results demonstrating that day length and temperature conditions during embryo formation and maturation can influence the phenotypic performance of seedlings in Norway spruce. This effect may influence the fitness of naturally regenerated plants produced in plantations of Central European trees in Norway.																	1614-2942					DEC	2010	6	1					93	99		10.1007/s11295-009-0231-z								WOS:000272180600009

Micronesian Mangrove Forest Structure and Tree Responses to a Severe Typhoon	WETLANDS												Tropical cyclones are common disturbances that have strong effects on mangrove composition and structure. Because there are numerous ecosystem services provided by mangroves, it is important to understand their adaptations and responses to these climatic events. In April 2004, Typhoon Sudal, a category 3-4 cyclone, passed over the state of Yap, Federated States of Micronesia. For four months following the typhoon we measured forest structure, above-ground biomass, tree mortality and response in six mangroves. The sites were dominated by species common in mangroves throughout the Indo-Pacific-Sonneratia alba, Brugueira gymnorrhiza, and Rhizophora apiculata. Total above-ground biomass (TAGB) of mangrove forests ranged from 211-573 Mg ha(-1). Tree mortality ranged from 6% to 32% among stands. Adaptations and responses to the typhoon varied by species, as well as by geographic location. Sonneratia alba had a higher frequency of mainstems broken (26%), but was the only species that vigorously sprouted from dormant basal or epicormic tissues. Standing live trees accounted for 80-95% of TAGB, suggesting that adaptations of mangrove trees can facilitate the persistence of an intact forest structure following typhoons of this intensity. Climatic changes such as sea level rise and increased severity of cyclonic events could alter this relationship.																	0277-5212					DEC	2010	30	6					1077	1084		10.1007/s13157-010-0114-y								WOS:000285095400007

Although its young larvae usually overwinter in diapause from early autumn to the beginning of spring, winter larval feeding has been reported when this species feeds on the evergreen woody shrub strawberry tree Arbutus unedo. The present study investigated life-history traits of four populations of E. chrysorrhoea feeding on A. unedo, including phenology of the different life stages, larval feeding activity and diapause incidence. By modelling the relationship between larval size and host plant leaf persistence, elevation and mean annual temperature, we also studied larval development in ten populations of this species sampled from a range of geographical locations in Spain, from both A. unedo and deciduous hosts. The results obtained revealed that on A. unedo, E. chrysorrhoea phenology has shifted: from October to March, A. unedo larvae doubled their size, whereas, on deciduous Ulmus minor and Quercus faginea, larval size did not change. General linear models demonstrated that such differences were not related to environmental variables. We also found that on A. unedo larval feeding was arrested for 2 months, with this period representing a true diapause. The results obtained in the present study suggest that E. chrysorrhoea populations are phenologically adapted to their local host plants, and that the presence of foliage is a key element in the phenological shift reported on A. unedo. These results may have implications with respect to the formation of E. chrysorrhoea host races.

Genetic Differentiation, Clinal Variation and Phenotypic Associations With Growth Cessation Across the Populus tremula Photoperiodic Pathway	GENETICS												Perennial plants monitor seasonal changes through changes in environmental conditions such as the quantity and quality of light. To ensure a correct initiation of critical developmental processes, such as the initiation and cessation of growth, plants have adapted to a spatially variable light regime and genes in the photoperiodic pathway have been implicated as likely sources for these adaptations. Here we examine genetic variation in genes from the photoperiodic pathway in Populus tremula (Salicaceae) for signatures diversifying selection in response to varying light regimes across a latitudinal gradient. We fail to identify any loci with unusually high levels of genetic differentiation among populations despite identifying four SNPs that show significant allele frequency clines with latitude. We do, however, observe large covariance in allelic effects across populations for growth cessation, a highly adaptive trait in P. tremula. High covariance in allelic effects is a signature compatible with diversifying selection along an environmental gradient. We also observe significantly higher heterogeneity in genetic differentiation among SNPs from the photoperiod genes than among SNPs from randomly chosen genes. This suggests that spatially variable selection could be affecting genes from the photoperiod pathway even if selection is not strong enough to cause individual loci to be identified as outliers. SNPs from three genes in the photoperiod pathway (PHYB2, LHY1, and LHY2) show significant associations with natural variation in growth cessation. Collectively these SNPs explain 10-15% of the phenotypic variation in growth cessation. Covariances in allelic effects across populations help explain an additional 5-7% of the phenotypic variation in growth cessation.

Cold tolerance of the overwintering larval instars of light brown apple moth Epiphyas postvittana	JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY												The light brown apple moth, Epiphyas postvittana, a leafroller native to southeastern Australia was discovered in California in 2006. The highly polyphagous nature of this pest adds to the importance of being able to predict the potential distribution of this invader across the North American continent. The spread of ectothermic species that lack winter diapause, such as E. postvittana, can be limited by their ability to tolerate cold temperature extremes. In this study we examined the cold hardiness of 4th to 6th instar E. postvittana, the only life stages known to overwinter in California, through a combination of supercooling point (SCP) and mortality at low temperatures. Our results showed that the mean SCP for E. postvittana ranged from -14.1 degrees C for 6th instars to -16.0 degrees C for 4th instars. Lethal time leading to 50% mortality (LT(50)) for the three instars combined were 2.5 h at -10.5 degrees C, 41 h at -6.5 degrees C and 198 h at -0.9 degrees C. At 3 degrees C, the LT(50) of 4th instars was significantly lower at 775 h than that for 5th and 6th instars combined at 1029 h. The cold hardiness characteristics of later-instar E. postvittana larvae were comparable to those of pink bollworm, Pectinophora gossypiella, a diapausing invasive with a geographic distribution restricted to southern California. Slightly greater cold hardiness is shown by the indigenous non-diapausing leafroller Argyrotaenia franciscana, which is restricted to the Pacific Coast of North America. We therefore conclude that the moderate cold hardiness of E. postvittana will substantially limit its spread into northern temperate regions of North America. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The model is able to encapsulate a rich collection of ecological behaviours, including the Allee effect, resource depletion due to consumption, dispersal adaptation due to population pressure, biological control agents, and a range of breeding suppression mechanisms such as embryonic diapause. delayed development and sperm storage. It is shown how many of these phenomena can be characterised as density-dependence in a few fundamental ecological parameters.

J	Kishkinev, D; Chernetsov, N; Mouritsen, H				Kishkinev, Dmitry; Chernetsov, Nikita; Mouritsen, Henrik			A DOUBLE-CLOCK OR JETLAG MECHANISM IS UNLIKELY TO BE INVOLVED IN DETECTION OF EAST-WEST DISPLACEMENTS IN A LONG-DISTANCE AVIAN MIGRANT	AUK												Migratory birds are known to be able to navigate to determine their position on the globe and the direction toward their distant goal-even if they cannot perceive any information emanating from the goal. One hypothesis, that of true bicoordinate navigation, claims that birds should be able to sense and use a grid of two natural parameters as coordinates. Some indirect data support the idea that migratory birds can determine their north south position, and several recent studies have suggested that at least long-distance migrants, including the Eurasian Reed Warbler (Acrocephalus scirpaceus), can determine their east west position. How they do this remains a mystery. Birds could theoretically detect the magnitude of east west displacements if they have two clocks, one synchronizing faster to local time than the other. We tested whether this putative "double-clock" mechanism may serve as a navigational tool for detecting east west position. We captured Eurasian Reed Warblers during spring migration and tested their orientation in Emlen funnels under capture-site photoperiodic conditions. After these northeasterly oriented control tests, we exposed them to a light dark regime that simulated a 1,000-km eastward displacement to the Moscow region from which we have shown that actually displaced Eurasian Reed Warblers on spring migration compensate for their displacement by orienting northwestwardly. Exposure to the Moscow light dark regime did not affect the birds' orientation. Our results suggest that light dark regime effects alone are unlikely to trigger compensation for the longitudinal displacement in long-distance migratory Eurasian Reed Warblers.

Seasonal Adaptations to Day Length in Ecotypes of Diorhabda spp. (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) Inform Selection of Agents Against Saltcedars (Tamarix spp.)	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												Seasonal adaptations to daylength often limit the effective range of insects used in biological control of weeds. The leaf beetle Diorhabda carinulata (Desbrochers) was introduced into North America from Fukang, China (latitude 44 degrees N) to control saltcedars (Tamarix spp.), but failed to establish south of 38 degrees N latitude because of a mismatched critical daylength response for diapause induction. The daylength response caused beetles to enter diapause too early in the season to survive the duration of winter at southern latitudes. Using climate chambers, we characterized the critical daylength response for diapause induction (CDL) in three ecotypes of Diorhabda beetles originating from 36,38, and 43 degrees N latitudes in Eurasia. In a field experiment, the timing of reproductive diapause and voltinism were compared among ecotypes by rearing the insects on plants in the field. CDL declined with latitude of origin among Diorhabda ecotypes. Moreover, CDL in southern (<39 degrees N latitude) ecotypes was shortened by more than an hour when the insects were reared under a fluctuating 35-15 degrees C thermoperiod than at a constant 25 degrees C. In the northern (>42 degrees N latitude) ecotypes, however. CDL was relatively insensitive to temperature. The southern ecotypes produced up to four generations when reared on plants in the field at sites south of 38 degrees N, whereas northern ecotypes produced only one or two generations. The study reveals latitudinal variation in how Diorhabda ecotypes respond to daylength for diapause induction and how these responses affect insect voltinism across the introduced range.																	0046-225X					OCT	2010	39	5					1666	1675		10.1603/EN09270								WOS:000282852600034	22546466

THREE SELECTIONS ARE BETTER THAN ONE: CLINAL VARIATION OF THERMAL QTL FROM INDEPENDENT SELECTION EXPERIMENTS IN DROSOPHILA	EVOLUTION												We report the results of two independent selection experiments that have exposed distinct populations of Drosophila melanogaster to different forms of thermal selection. A recombinant population derived from Arvin California and Zimbabwe isofemale lines was exposed to laboratory natural selection at two temperatures (T(AZ): 18 degrees C and 28 degrees C). Microsatellite mapping identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) on the X-chromosome between the replicate "Hot" and "Cold" populations. In a separate experiment, disruptive selection was imposed on an outbred California population for the "knockdown" temperature (T(KD)) in a thermal column. Microsatellite mapping of the "High" and "Low" populations also uncovered primarily X-linked QTL. Notably, a marker in the shaggy locus at band 3A was significantly differentiated in both experiments. Finer scale mapping of the 3A region has narrowed the QTL to the shaggy gene region, which contains several candidate genes that function in circadian rhythms. The same allele that was increased in frequency in the High T(KD) populations is significantly clinal in North America and is more common at the warm end of the cline (Florida vs. Maine; however, the cline was not apparent in Australia). Together, these studies show that independent selection experiments can uncover the same target of selection and that evolution in the laboratory can recapitulate putatively adaptive clinal variation in nature.																	0014-3820					OCT	2010	64	10					2921	2934		10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.01039.x								WOS:000282573800009	20497214

Potential of Ripe Pawpaw Fruit Extract as an Insecticide and Feeding Deterrent for Striped Cucumber Beetle (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) on Squash	JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGICAL SCIENCE												Laboratory experiments were performed to study the effects of pawpaw, Asimina triloba (L.) Dunal, fruit extract on mortality and feeding deterrence of striped cucumber beetle, Acalymma vittatum (F). Recently, fruit tissues of pawpaw were found to contain phenolic and antioxidant compounds, as well as annonaceous acetogenin compounds having insecticidal activity. Ripe pawpaw fruit pulp from a range of pawpaw varieties was extracted with 100% ethyl alcohol to obtain acetogenin compounds. Pulp extracts of 0, 10, 100, 1,000, 10,000 and 50,000 ppm were then used to assess feeding deterrence and mortality of beetles. Buttercup squash leaf disks 3.5 cm in diameter were treated individually with each concentration and placed on water moistened filter paper in plastic Petri dishes (9 cm diam). Five striped cucumber beetles were placed on each leaf disk. All Petri dishes were then placed in an environmental growth chamber at 27 degrees C and a 16:8 h light:dark photoperiod. Feeding activity was recorded 1, 4 and 24 h after beetle introduction. After 24 h the beetles were removed. Beetles did not feed on treated squash leaves at either 1 or 4 h of exposure. However, significant feeding occurred between 4 and 24 h after beetle introduction. Feeding was lowest and feeding damage least on 50,000 ppm pawpaw-treated leaf disks compared with leaf disks treated with < 10,000 ppm dilutions. Pawpaw fruit extract reduced feeding by 89% and 97% in the 10,000 and 50,000 ppm treatments, respectively. The calculated LC50 value was 50,538 ppm whereas the LCF10 (concentration at which only 10% of the leaves were consumed) was 2,033 ppm. At 10,000 ppm 10% of the beetles were killed; however, only 3% of the leaf tissue was consumed. Thus, pawpaw fruit extract may be an effective insect feeding deterrent. The duration of treatment effectiveness and susceptibility of other pest and beneficial insect species to the extracts also needs to be examined.																	0749-8004					OCT	2010	45	4					378	384		10.18474/0749-8004-45.4.378								WOS:000283475200007

Effect of altitude on thermal responses of Liolaemus pictus argentinus in Argentina	JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY												Reptiles that live in cooler environments hibernate longer and, when active, limit daily activity times, allocate more time and energy toward thermoregulation, and consequently experience life-history constraints such as reduced fecundity and supra-annual reproductive cycles. This pattern becomes more extreme with increasing latitude and altitude. We compared the thermal biology of two populations of Liolaemus pictus argentinus living at two altitudes (771 and similar to 1700 m asl). Environmental, microenvironmental, and operative temperatures were studied in order to describe the capture sites, sources of heat, and availability of microenvironments appropriate for thermoregulation. The body temperatures of L. p. argentinus at capture (T(b)) and the preferred temperatures in the laboratory (T(p)) were recorded and integrated with operative temperatures to calculate the effectiveness of thermoregulation. The high-altitude population was found to have a lower mean T(b) (29 degrees C compared to 33 degrees C), while the T(p) values for both populations were similar (36.7 degrees C). The analysis of operative temperatures and T(b) in relation to T(p) showed that L. p. argentinus behaves as a moderate thermoregulator at high altitude and as a poor thermoregulator at the low-altitude site probably due in part to the avoidance of predation risk.

Population dynamics of goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis) in the core of its historical range	PLANT ECOLOGY												Goldenseal, Hydrastis canadensis L. (Ranunculaceae), is a perennial woodland herb of eastern North America harvested for the medicinal properties of its rhizome. Although listed in Appendix II of the Convention on Trade in Endangered Species, little is known of its population dynamics in the core of its historical range. We investigated the demography of wild populations at three forest interior sites in Ohio, including both sexual and asexual reproduction, in order to model population dynamics in the core of its historical range. We recognized six life history stages, and parameterized stage-structured (Lefkovich) transition matrices for each population. Marked individuals were monitored and field experiments were conducted to characterize and quantify seed dormancy, seedling establishment, and vegetative reproduction. We found seedling recruitment to be more common than suggested by previous studies, but less common than vegetative reproduction, and less important to projected population growth. The finite rate of increase, lambda, was greater than 1 for each population based on transition matrices for 1998-1999, but much less than 1 for two populations (and a parts per thousand 1 for the third) based on 1999-2000 matrices. This reduction in lambda appears due to lower survival and growth of established (non-seedling) plants, which may have been due to drought in spring 1999. In both year-to-year transitions, fertile plants typically regressed to the large sterile stage. This research provides a basis for exploring the effects of different harvest strategies on the population dynamics of H. canadensis, enabling assessment of sustainability.																	1385-0237					OCT	2010	210	2					195	211		10.1007/s11258-010-9749-2								WOS:000281259700001

Robert; Denlinger, David L.; Armbruster, Peter			The molecular physiology of increased egg desiccation resistance during diapause in the invasive mosquito, Aedes albopictus	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Photoperiodic diapause is a crucial adaptation to seasonal environmental variation in a wide range of arthropods, but relatively little is known regarding the molecular basis of this important trait. In temperate populations of the mosquito Aedes albopictus, exposure to short-day (SD) lengths causes the female to produce diapause eggs. Tropical populations do not undergo a photoperiodic diapause. We identified a fatty acyl coA elongase transcript that is more abundant under SD versus long-day (LD) photoperiods in mature oocyte tissue of replicate temperate, but not tropical, A. albopictus populations. Fatty acyl CoA elongases are involved in the synthesis of long chain fatty acids (hydrocarbon precursors). Diapause eggs from a temperate population had one-third more surface hydrocarbons and one-half the water loss rates of non-diapause eggs. Eggs from a tropical population reared under SD and LD photoperiods did not differ in surface hydrocarbon abundance or water loss rates. In both a temperate and tropical population, composition of hydrocarbon chain lengths did not differ between eggs from SD versus LD conditions. These results implicate the expression of fatty acyl coA elongase and changes in quantity, but not composition, of egg surface hydrocarbons as important components of increased desiccation resistance during diapause in A. albopictus.																	0962-8452	1471-2954				SEP 7	2010	277	1694					2683	2692		10.1098/rspb.2010.0362								WOS:000280320900013	20410035

Satyridae) shows enigmatic patterns of voltmism, ranging from one generation a year, with adult emergence in June or midsummer, to two generations, with adults emerging in June and September; to several generations with adults emerging intermittently from spring to autumn. Local populations with different voltimsm patterns are geographically intermingled, suggesting at best a weak relation between voltimsm and climatic factors Y. multistriata populations are highly localized and the species has suffered recent reductions in density, suggesting that the voltimsm differences may be of phylogenetic origin and also leading to the species being classified as endangered. To examine whether the geographic variation in voltimsm is phylogenetically constrained, we constructed genealogical trees and a haplotype network of populations of I multistriata The phylogenetic analyses of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) region revealed that phylogenetically close populations, despite close geographic proximity, often display different voltimsm The haplotype network showed the same trends Similarly, an analysis of molecular variance revealed that the voltimsm types hardly accounted for the variance Thus, we concluded that geographic variation in voltimsm of multistriata is at best only slightly attributable to phylogenetic constraints and instead may be due mainly to adaptation to the unique ecological selective regime of each population				Noriyuki, Suzuki/I-4882-2015	Noriyuki, Suzuki/0000-0002-7483-0758												0013-8746					SEP	2010	103	5					716	722		10.1603/AN09125								WOS:000281655300004

A sophisticated life history strategy in a parasitoid wasp: Producing univoltine and multivoltine phenotypes in a local population	BIOLOGICAL CONTROL												Insects may adopt a range of strategies such as diapause, migration and phenotypic plasticity to achieve maximal survival and reproduction in response to the environment. However, the phenotypic plasticity of voltinism in local populations of biological control agents is still poorly understood, making evaluation of biological control efficiency difficult. Here we report our two years' work on a parasitic wasp, Platygaster demades Walker (Hymenoptera: Platygasteridae), a parasitoid of apple leaf-curling midge, Dasineura mali Kieffer (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae). P. demades produces aestivating and non-aestivating phenotypes at the embryonic stage over the season. It regulates the frequency and duration of aestivating phenotypes from the late spring to mid autumn and adjusts the embryonic developmental rate of non-aestivating phenotypes from the early to late autumn, producing univoltine, bivoltine, trivoltine and quadrivoltine phenotypes over the season. The regulation of aestivation frequency and duration is a temporal risk-spreading strategy for maximal survival, i.e., when the future food source is expected to be short the wasp regulates its population by entering aestivation in a frequency and duration concordant with the expected scale and duration of food shortage to avoid massive mortality. This strategy helps maintain a large overwintering population size for the next season. The adjustment of the embryonic developmental rate for the non-aestivating phenotype from the early to late autumn is an adaptive developmental strategy for maximal synchronization with the host, D. mali, i.e., the later the D. mali larvae become mature, the faster the parasitoid embryos develop. This strategy ensures that both aestivated and non-aestivated individuals reach a complete synchronization with the emergence of their hosts in the next spring. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

MITOCHONDRIAL METABOLITES IN TISSUES AS INDICATORS OF METABOLIC ALTERATIONS DURING HIBERNATION	CRYOLETTERS												The decrease in metabolism is one of mechanisms for hibernating animals to resist hypoxia and oxidative stress. Assuming that the inhibition of mitochondria; respiration in torpor and its activation upon arousal are accompanied by changes in the content of mitochondrial substrates, we estimated the levels of endogenous metabolites of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in the liver, brown adipose tissue, and the brain of the arctic ground squirrels as possible indicators of mitochondrial processes. The level of lactate in the same tissues and serum was determined as marker of hypoxia. It was found that the isocitrate (ISC) concentration in all tissues was one order of magnitude higher than that of alpha-ketoglutarate (KGL), while succinate was not detected in any of tissues, indicating the inhibition at the initial stages of the TCA cycle. During the torpor, the concentrations of ISC, KGL and lactate predominantly decreased in tissues. Serum lactate decreased five-fold in torpor and was restored in a temperature-dependent manner with a long period of persistence of stable concentration in the range of body temperature between 12 and 27 degrees C upon arousal. The data obtained indicate the development of metabolic depression rather than hypoxia in these tissues.																	0143-2044					SEP-OCT	2010	31	5					392	400										WOS:000284194600004	21042654

(Heteroptera: Pentatomidae)	ENTOMOLOGICAL SCIENCE												The bug Andrallus spinidens (F.) (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae) is a polyphagous predator of insect larvae, which is distributed in tropical and warm temperate zones worldwide. Seasonal occurrence and diapause induction of this bug were studied in a population in Miyazaki, southern Kyushu, Japan. The field research showed that A. spinidens produces three or four generations a year and is most abundant from mid-summer to autumn. Reproductive activity of field-collected adults decreased from late summer to autumn, indicating that this bug enters adult diapause in autumn. Only adults were found in early spring and these were reproductive. Laboratory experiments showed that, irrespective of photoperiod, adult diapause is induced at lower temperatures (< 22.5 degrees C), whereas it is avoided at higher temperatures (>= 25 degrees C). Ambient temperature falls across the critical range from late summer to autumn. Thus, the bug clearly overwinters in adult diapause induced by low temperatures and this diapause is terminated during the course of winter.																	1343-8786					SEP	2010	13	3					273	279		10.1111/j.1479-8298.2010.00386.x								WOS:000282222400001

Environmental effects on bet hedging in Aedes mosquito egg hatch	EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY												We used a path analysis procedure to examine the influence of environmental effects on the egg hatching response of the container breeding mosquito, Aedes triseriatus. A. triseriatus eggs were collected from 22 different sites across the eastern US, and exposed to repeated hatch stimuli in the laboratory. The resulting data were used to construct hatch indexes for each site. Structural equation modeling was used to discriminate among hypotheses relating to the functional relationships between population hatch trait and local climatic conditions. The results suggest that the delayed hatch pattern is an adaptive bet-hedging strategy that allows the species to manage desiccation risks. The selected model indicates that environmental variables differentially affect the immediate and the delayed, long term hatch patterns. High temperatures directly reduce the number of egg hatching on the first stimulus, but only indirectly affect the delayed hatch pattern. Low precipitation and high variability in precipitation directly increase the delaying pattern. The hatch trait appears to be a critical adaptation that allows the species to occupy a broad range in east North America.

The effects of host size and temperature on the emergence of Echinoparyphium recurvatum cercariae from Lymnaea peregra under natural light conditions	JOURNAL OF HELMINTHOLOGY												The production of cercariae from their snail host is a fundamental component of transmission success in trematodes. The emergence of Echinoparyphium recurvatum (Trematoda: Echinostomatidae) cercariae from Lymnaea peregra was studied under natural sunlight conditions, using naturally infected snails of different sizes (10-17 mm) within a temperature range of 10-29 degrees C. There was a single photoperiodic circadian cycle of emergence with one peak, which correlated with the maximum diffuse sunlight irradiation. At 21 degrees C the daily number of emerging cercariae increased with increasing host snail size, but variations in cercarial emergence did occur between both individual snails and different days. There was only limited evidence of cyclic emergence patterns over a 3-week period, probably due to extensive snail mortality, particularly those in the larger size classes. Very few cercariae emerged in all snail size classes at the lowest temperature studied (10 degrees C), but at increasingly higher temperatures elevated numbers of cercariae emerged, reaching an optimum between 17 and 25 degrees C. Above this range emergence was reduced. At all temperatures more cercariae emerged from larger snails. Analysis of emergence using the Q(10) value, a measure of physiological processes over temperature ranges, showed that between 10 and 21 degrees C (approximate to 15 degrees C) Q(10) values exceeded 100 for all snail size classes, indicating a substantially greater emergence than would be expected for normal physiological rates. From 14 to 25 degrees C (approximate to 20 degrees C) cercarial emergence in most snail size classes showed little change in Q(10), although in the smallest size class emergence was still substantially greater than the typical Q(10) increase expected over this temperature range. At the highest range of 21-29 degrees C (approximate to 25 degrees C), Q(10) was much reduced. The importance of these results for cercarial emergence under global climate change is discussed.

Allocation from capital and income sources to reproduction shift from first to second clutch in the flesh fly, Sarcophaga crassipalpis	JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY												Understanding how resources are allocated between survival and reproduction is fundamental to the study of the evolution of life histories. Reproductive resources can come from two intrinsic resource pools, stored reserves (capital) acquired before reproduction or income acquired during reproduction. The variety of reproductive strategies in insects is remarkable and reproductive allocation encompasses the complete range of allocation strategies from pure capital breeders to pure income breeders. However, most organisms probably use a blend of capital and income and this blend is likely dynamic, changing between reproductive bouts in response to internal and external conditions. We used stable isotopes to quantify the allocation of capital and income resources to reproduction in the flesh fly, Sarcopha crassipalpis and assessed how allocation patterns change over multiple bouts of reproduction. Sarcophaga crassipalpis shifts from a slight investment of capital in the first clutch to an almost pure income breeder in the second clutch. We discuss the relationship between activity and allocation, and the potential for this system to understand how allocation patterns change in response to environmental stress. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

STUDIES ON HIBERNATING POPULATIONS OF CULEX PIPIENS FROM A WEST NILE VIRUS ENDEMIC FOCUS IN NEW YORK CITY: PARITY RATES AND ISOLATION OF WEST NILE VIRUS	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MOSQUITO CONTROL ASSOCIATION												A 3-year study was undertaken to examine the parity status, survival, and prevalence of West Nile virus (WNV) in overwintering populations of Culex pipiens pipiens collected from a hibernaculum located in a WNV endemic region in New York City. Nearly 6,000 females were collected from December through April. Parity rates were highest among females collected in December and January, ranging from 12.3% to 21.9%, depending on the year. In each year of the study, the proportion of parous females declined significantly during the course of the winter; the percentage of parous females found in April ranged from 0.9% to 10%. Results provide unequivocal evidence that parous Cx. p. pipiens females from this region of the northeastern US enter hibernacula in the fall in comparatively high proportions not previously recognized for this species, and while these females experience significant mortality during the winter, some survived to April to emerge in the spring. The absence of any detectible blood remnants in overwintering females reaffirms that blood feeding does not occur among diapausing females during the winter. The possibility that a portion of the diapausing population may be autogenous as a result of hybridization with sympatric belowground populations of Cx. p. pipiens "form molestus" is discussed. A single isolation of WNV was obtained in Vero cell culture from a pool of 50 females collected on January 11, 2007, representing an infection prevalence of 0.07% in the overwintering population in 2007 (n = 1,370 mosquitoes, 33 pools). No isolations of WNV were made from mosquitoes collected in 2008 (n = 1,870 mosquitoes, 190 pools) or 2009 (n = 1,767 mosquitoes, 184 pools). Findings provide further evidence for local overwintering of WNV in diapausing Cx. p. pipiens, albeit at very low rates, consistent with the paucity of WNV-positive mosquitoes detected in June and early July despite the emergence of females from hibernacula in early May in this region.																	8756-971X					SEP	2010	26	3					257	264		10.2987/10-6004.1								WOS:000208391400004	21033052

The phenomenon may be more frequent than stated so far and discovery of its role in plant life history and performance is still underway. Data from published papers was reviewed and all known species exhibiting dormancy were analysed from the aspect of species ecological values. Adaptation to environmental factors (light, moisture, pH and nitrogen as estimated by Ellenberg indicator values) influences the maximum duration of dormancy. A higher proportion of plants are dormant in species that prefer to grow in good light conditions, dry sites and infertile soil. The duration of dormant period is longer in species that prefer to grow in dry sites and/or calcareous soils. A range of factors, we believe, control plant behaviour, however, it is suggested that environmental stress is the principal factor inducing dormancy.

J	Egli, T				Egli, Thomas			How to live at very low substrate concentration	WATER RESEARCH												Availability of carbon/energy sources and temperature are the two environmental factors that severely restrict heterotrophic growth in most ecosystems. DOC concentrations in ground, drinking and surface waters are typically in the range of 0.5-5 mg/L, but most of this is present in a polymeric, inaccessible form for microbes. Concentrations of microbiologically available carbon compounds (so-called assimilable organic carbon, AOC) are usually in the range of 10-100 mu g/L, those of individual sugars or amino acids are not higher than a few mu g/L. Until recently microbiologists assumed that such nutrient-poor (oligotrophic) environments are "deserts" for life, and that the majority of bacterial cells seen in the microscope are dead, dormant or at least severely starved. Nevertheless, despite the low concentrations of available carbon compounds, bacterial cell numbers recorded in these environments typically are in the range of 10(5)-10(6) per mL. Over the last years, we have learnt that most of these microbes are perfectly alive, metabolizing and ready to grow when given the chance. Hence, microbes have adapted and developed strategies to cope with this situation. Laboratory studies with pure cultures suggest that bacterial cells have developed two strategies to live under such conditions. The first strategy is to perform a "multivorous" way of life by taking up and metabolizing dozens of different carbon substrates simultaneously (i.e., they are NOT specializing on a particular substrate, which they can take up with very high affinity). This "mixed substrate growth" equips the cell with a kinetic advantage and metabolic flexibility. Simultaneous utilization of a multitude of carbon substrates allows fast growth at minute concentrations of individual substrates. The second strategy is to minimize maintenance requirements (unfortunately we still know little about how this is achieved). Recently, flow cytometry has been employed to study microbial growth in very dilute, nutrient-poor environments. The technique allows fast and easy quantification of microbial growth of natural bacterial communities, including "uncultivable" members, under environmental conditions. When combined with strain-specific fluorescent immuno-probes, this technique allows investigation of the growth and competition of pathogens with the indigenous microbial flora. This method is particularly suited for studying questions concerning microbial growth and survival in drinking water systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous studies have revealed that in Osaka, southwestern Japan, L. valentiana reproduces from November to April. In the present study, in order to clarify the climatic adaptations of L. valentiana in Japan, we examined the life cycle of this slug in Sapporo, northern Japan. In the Sapporo population, the ratio of gonad weight to body weight reached a maximum in September. Most slugs had mature sperm from late August to April and large oocytes from September to April. Thus, the Sapporo population of L. valentiana commenced reproduction two months earlier than the Osaka population. We also examined the effect of various photoperiodic conditions on growth and reproductive maturation in both the Osaka and Sapporo populations. The effect of photoperiod on growth was different in the two populations. In both populations, however, reproductive maturation was induced by short days of photophase 14 h or less, and there was no obvious difference between the two populations, even though reproductive maturation in the wild commences in different seasons. This indicates the possibility that L. valentiana adapts to climatically different regions without changes in its critical daylength in photoperiodic response.

Zoological Studies 49(5): 625-631. Variations in the body weight of bluegill Lepomis macrochirus among 10 coastal regions of Lake Biwa and 11 lagoons of the lake were studied in Oct. 2005 and Oct. 2007, respectively. The body weights of fish with a normalized total length were estimated from length-weight relationships determined at each site. Body weights of bluegill from the lake and lagoons increased linearly with latitude. Additionally, there was a negative correlation between the calculated body weight and the number of sampled bluegill per unit time from the lagoons, implying that the population density of bluegill may strongly influence its growth in lagoons. Increasing numbers of submerged plants have covered the lake area in recent years, especially in the shallow southern basin. Moreover, as a predator of bluegill, the largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides appears to flourish at higher densities in the northern basin of the lake than in the southern basin. These biotic factors seem to be somewhat responsible for the significant difference between the northern and southern basins in terms of the body weight of bluegill. However, water temperature and population density of the bluegill appear to be more directly responsible for the latitudinal variation in bluegill growth in Lake Biwa. http://zoolstud.sinica.edu.tw/Journals/49.5/625.pdf				stud, zool/G-4030-2011													1021-5506					SEP	2010	49	5					625	631										WOS:000282297800005

However, according to developmental period, longevity and fecundity, mandarin was the best among the three host plants.																	0785-8760					AUG 25	2010	21	2					84	89										WOS:000281696800003						
J	Ganguly, S; Friedl, MA; Tan, B; Zhang, XY; Verma, M				Ganguly, Sangram; Friedl, Mark A.; Tan, Bin; Zhang, Xiaoyang; Verma, Manish			Land surface phenology from MODIS: Characterization of the Collection 5 global land cover dynamics product	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Information related to land surface phenology is important for a variety of applications. For example, phenology is widely used as a diagnostic of ecosystem response to global change. In addition, phenology influences seasonal scale fluxes of water, energy, and carbon between the land surface and atmosphere. Increasingly, the importance of phenology for studies of habitat and biodiversity is also being recognized. While many data sets related to plant phenology have been collected at specific sites or in networks focused on individual plants or plant species, remote sensing provides the only way to observe and monitor phenology over large scales and at regular intervals. The MODIS Global Land Cover Dynamics Product was developed to support investigations that require regional to global scale information related to spatio-temporal dynamics in land surface phenology. Here we describe the Collection 5 version of this product, which represents a substantial refinement relative to the Collection 4 product. This new version provides information related to land surface phenology at higher spatial resolution than Collection 4 (500-m vs. 1-km), and is based on 8-day instead of 16-day input data. The paper presents a brief overview of the algorithm, followed by an assessment of the product. To this end, we present (1) a comparison of results from Collection 5 versus Collection 4 for selected MODIS tiles that span a range of climate and ecological conditions, (2) a characterization of interannual variation in Collections 4 and 5 data for North America from 2001 to 2006, and (3) a comparison of Collection 5 results against ground observations for two forest sites in the northeastern United States. Results show that the Collection 5 product is qualitatively similar to Collection 4. However, Collection 5 has fewer missing values outside of regions with persistent cloud cover and atmospheric aerosols. Interannual variability in Collection 5 is consistent with expected ranges of variance suggesting that the algorithm is reliable and robust, except in the tropics where some systematic differences are observed. Finally, comparisons with ground data suggest that the algorithm is performing well, but that end of season metrics associated with vegetation senescence and dormancy have higher uncertainties than start of season metrics.

Their phylogenetic position, in the early-diverging eudicots, makes them especially suitable for exploring the evolution of floral traits and the fate of gene paralogs that may have shaped the radiation of the eudicots. A current limitation in evolution of plant development studies is the lack of genetic tools for conducting functional assays in key taxa spanning the angiosperm phylogeny. We first show that virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) of a PHYTOENE DESATURASE ortholog (TdPDS) can be achieved in Thalictrum dioicum with an efficiency of 42% and a survival rate of 97%, using tobacco rattle virus (TRV) vectors. The photobleached leaf phenotype of silenced plants significantly correlates with the down-regulation of endogenous TdPDS (P < 0.05), as compared to controls. Floral silencing of PDS was achieved in the faster flowering spring ephemeral T. thalictroides. In its close relative, T. clavatum, silencing of the floral MADS box gene AGAMOUS (AG) resulted in strong homeotic conversions of floral organs. In conclusion, we set forth our optimized protocol for VIGS by vacuum-infiltration of Thalictrum seedlings or dormant tubers as a reference for the research community. The three species reported here span the range of floral morphologies and pollination syndromes present in Thalictrum. The evidence presented on floral silencing of orthologs of the marker gene PDS and the floral homeotic gene AG will enable a comparative approach to the study of the evolution of flower development in this group.

J	Lampei, C; Tielborger, K				Lampei, Christian; Tielboerger, Katja			Evolvability of between-year seed dormancy in populations along an aridity gradient	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY												Under global climate change, adaptation to new conditions is crucial for plant species persistence. This requires the ability to evolve in traits that are correlated with changing climatic variables. We studied between-year seed dormancy, which correlates with environmental variability, and tested for clinal trends in its evolvability along an aridity gradient in Israel. We conducted a germination experiment under five irrigation levels with two dryland winter annuals (Biscutella didyma, Bromus fasciculatus) from four sites along the gradient. Species differed in means and evolvability of dormancy. Biscutella had high dormancy, which significantly increased with aridity but decreased with higher irrigation. In Bromus, dormancy was low, similar among populations, and only marginally affected by irrigation. Evolvability in Biscutella was high and varied among populations, without a clinal trend along the gradient. Conversely, in Bromus, trait evolvability was low and declined with increasing aridity. We argue that changes in evolvability along climatic gradients depend on the relative intensity of stabilizing selection. This may be high in Bromus and not only depends on environmental stress, but also on variability. Our findings point to the importance of measuring evolvability of climate-related traits across different natural and artificial environments and for many coexisting species.

The issue has large public health consequences but few studies have described the main socio-demographic characteristics of people exposed to traffic. Objectives: To characterise a large cohort of residents in Rome according to different measures of traffic exposure, socioeconomic position (SEP), and baseline health status. Methods: Residents of Rome in October 2001 were selected. Individual and area-based SEP indices were available. GIS was used to obtain traffic indicators at residential addresses: distance from HTR (> = 10,000 vehicles/day), length of HTR, average daily traffic count, and traffic density within 150 meters of home. Hospitalisations in the 5-year period before enrolment were used to characterise health status. Logistic and linear regression analyses estimated the association between traffic exposure and socio-demographic characteristics. Results: We selected 1,898,898 subjects with complete SEP information and GIS traffic indicators. A total of 320,913 individuals (17%) lived within 50 meters of an HTR, and 14% lived between 50 and 100 meters. These proportions were higher among 75+ year-old subjects. Overall, all traffic indicators were directly associated with SEP, with people living in high or medium SEP areas or with a university degree more likely to be exposed to traffic than people living in low SEP areas or with a low level of education. However, an effect modification by area of residence within the city was seen and the association between traffic and SEP was reversed in the city centre. Conclusions: A large section of the population is exposed to traffic in Rome. Elderly people and those living in areas of high and medium SEP tend to be more exposed. These findings are related to the historical stratification of the population within the city according to age and socioeconomic status.

Relative effects of juvenile and adult environmental factors on mate attraction and recognition in the cricket, Allonemobius socius	JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE												Finding a mate is a fundamental aspect of sexual reproduction. To this end, specific-mate recognition systems (SMRS) have evolved that facilitate copulation between producers of the mating signal and their opposite-sex responders. Environmental variation, however, may compromise the efficiency with which SMRS operate. In this study, the degree to which seasonal climate experienced during juvenile and adult life-cycle stages affects the SMRS of a cricket, Allonemobius socius (Scudder) (Orthoptera: Gryllidae) was assessed. Results from two-choice behavioral trials suggest that adult ambient temperature, along with population and family origins, mediate variation in male mating call, and to a lesser extent directional response of females for those calls. Restricted maximum-likelihood estimates of heritability for male mating call components and for female response to mating call appeared statistically nonsignificant. However, appreciable "maternal genetic effects" suggest that maternal egg provisioning and other indirect maternal determinants of the embryonic environment significantly contributed to variation in male mating call and female response to mating calls. Thus, environmental factors can generate substantial variation in A. socius mating call, and, more importantly, their marginal effect on female responses to either fast-chirp or long-chirp mating calls suggest negative fitness consequences to males producing alternative types of calls. Future studies of sexual selection and SMRS evolution, particularly those focused on hybrid zone dynamics, should take explicit account of the loose concordance between signal producers and responders suggested by the current findings.																	1536-2442					JUL 4	2010	10						1	17	90	10.1673/031.010.9001								WOS:000279672500001	20673114

Logistic regression analysis involving 375 neonates born in the same geographical location within a three year period demonstrated that photoperiod (minutes) at conception predicts both genotype (P = 0.0139) and mutant allele carriage (P = 0.0161); the trend clearly showing that the 677T-MTHFR allele frequency increases as photoperiod increases. We propose a number of explanations, including a hypothesis in which a long photoperiod around conception decreases maternal systemic folate because of UVA induced dermal oxidative degradation of 5-methyl-H(4)folate, leading to a lower cellular 5,10-methylene-H(4)folate status. In this scenario, 5,10-methylene-H(4)folate would be more efficiently used for dTMP and DNA synthesis by 677T-MTHFR embryos than wildtype embryos giving the 677T-MTHFR embryos increased viability, and hence increasing mutant T-allele frequency. Alternate hypotheses include: increased seasonal availability of folate rich foods that genetically buffer any negative effect of 677T-MTHFR in embryos; seasonal oxidative stress lowering embryo-toxic homocysteine; an undefined hormonal effect of photoperiod on the neuroendocrine axis, which mediates genotype/embryo selection. The effect of photoperiod on genotype seems clear, but the speculative molecular mechanism underpinning the effect needs careful examination. Am. J. Hum. Biol. 22:484-489, 2010.

Habitat and Host Tree Selection by Wintering Yellow-bellied Sapsuckers in East Texas	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												Yellow-bellied Sapsucker (Sphyrapicus varius) foraging ecology has long been a focus of study, primarily due to their sap-foraging behavior throughout the year and speculation on how sapsuckers subsist by foraging on dormant host trees during winter. Wintering sapsucker habitat use as related to host tree selection is not clearly defined, particularly in the southwestern portion of its range. We studied Yellow-bellied Sapsucker habitat use and host tree selection in two bottomland hardwood forest sites in eastern Texas during winters, 2005-2006 and 2006-2007. Habitat surrounding overcup oak (Quercus lyrata) host trees was generally characterized by fewer trees/ha, lower species diversity and richness, and taller trees than random plots. Overcup oak host trees tended to be healthier than overcup oak non-host trees, but host trees had thinner, less complex bark than non-host trees, irrespective of tree size and health. Also, digestible cell and protein content was similar between host and non-host trees, irrespective of tree size and health. Selection of host trees with thinner, less complex bark suggest sapsuckers use visual cues to focus host selection upon bark morphology and evidence of previous use. Combined, wintering sapsuckers may increase foraging efficiency and maximize caloric intake by increasing energy gained/unit time foraging on already established, and presumably productive host trees. Despite similarities in habitat, health and cell and protein content between host and non-host trees, Yellow-bellied Sapsuckers selected healthy host trees with thin, less complex bark where stable levels of digestible cell content and protein over time provide a reliable, consistent food source throughout winter.																	0003-0031					JUL	2010	164	1					107	118		10.1674/0003-0031-164.1.107								WOS:000279415500011

Previous studies have shown that changes in the over-wintering pupal diapause are critical for differentially adapting R. pomonella flies to a difference in the fruiting times of apples vs. hawthorns, generating ecologically based reproductive isolation. Here, we exposed pupae of the hawthorn race to various combinations of pre- and over-wintering rearing conditions and analyzed their effects on eclosion time and genetics. We report certain unexpected results in regards to a combination of brief pre-winter and over-wintering periods indicative of gene*environment interactions requiring a reassessment of our current understanding of R. pomonella diapause. We present a hypothesis that involves physiological factors related to stored energy reserves in pupae that influences the depth and duration of Rhagoletis diapause. This 'pupal energy reserve' hypothesis can account for our findings and help clarify the role host plant-related life history adaptation plays in phytophage biodiversity.

Aestivation and diapause syndromes reduce the water balance requirements for pupae of the Hessian fly, Mayetiola destructor	ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA												We report the water balance of aestivating (summer), diapausing (winter), and non-diapausing pupae of Hessian fly, Mayetiola destructor (Say) (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae). Maintaining water requirements during pupal dormancy is particularly important because water cannot be replenished actively by drinking. Dehydration tolerance (25% loss before succumbing to dehydration) and water content (63-65%) were not different for the three types of pupae. Differences were noted in the net transpiration rates (NTRs, % body water per hour at 0% r.h.) between dormant (0.24-0.28% per hour) and non-diapausing (0.47% per hour) pupae 10 days after pupariation, but not between aestivating (0.28% per hour) and diapausing (0.24% per hour) pupae. These reduced NTRs result in extended pupal survival, indicated by adult eclosion, during exposure to dehydrating conditions. Net transpiration rates for aestivating and diapausing pupae were further reduced as dormancy progressed (up to 130 days) until individuals were moved to conditions that break dormancy. Pupae could not take up water from the atmosphere below vapor saturation (100% r.h. or 1.00 a(v)), and rely upon contact with liquid water or moist plant tissue to replenish their water stores. The critical transition temperatures (CTT) of the aestivating and diapausing pupae were significantly higher than those of non-diapausing pupae, suggesting that modified cuticular lipids are present on aestivating and diapausing pupae. Thus, aestivation and diapause trigger a dormancy specific water balance profile characterized by reduced NTRs and increased CTTs.

Latitudinal variation in breeding time reaction norms in a passerine bird	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												P>1. The timing of phenological events, as flowering time in plants or migration and breeding time in animals, is related to environmental conditions, e.g. local ambient temperature, and varies considerably between years. The relationship between the relevant environmental condition(s) and phenology can be described by a reaction norm. 2. Apart from variation among years phenology also varies geographically and the timing of phenological events is generally later at higher latitudes. However, whether this latitudinal trend is caused by a single reaction norm (and locally varying conditions) or whether reaction norms differ spatially is largely unknown. 3. Avian breeding time is determined by a variety of internal and external factors, e.g. photoperiod and temperature. The corresponding reaction norms are normally described by a regression of annual mean against temperatures averaged over a certain period. We circumvented problems inherent in this approach by using proportional hazards models to describe the relationship between breeding time and local temperature and day length. 4. The proportional hazards model describes a 'time to event', e.g. survival or in this case time until laying of the first egg, by modelling the probability that the event will occur per unit time as a function of an unspecified baseline hazard and fixed or time-dependent variables. Any variable that changes its value during the 'time to event', e.g. ambient temperature, can be included as time-dependent variable. 5. Applying this approach to a large data set of Finnish great tit (Parus major) egg laying dates from populations spanning about 700 km in latitude, we found that temperature- and day length-reaction norms vary with latitude. 6. Optimal reaction norms likely differ between populations and the observed variation in reaction norms among populations may thus reflect local adaptation. Under environmental change, local reaction norms may become suboptimal, and latitude-specific breeding time reaction norms may represent a source of variation that could benefit a species to adapt to such changes.

Prevalence of a virus inducing behavioural manipulation near species range border	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												The densities of conspecific individuals may vary through space, especially at the edge of species range. This variation in density is predicted to influence the diffusion of species-specific horizontally transmitted symbionts. However, to date there is very little data on how parasite prevalence varies around the border of a host species. Using a molecular epidemiology approach, we studied the prevalence of a vertically and horizontally transmitted virus at the edge of the geographic range of its insect host, the Drosophila parasitoid wasp Leptopilina boulardi. L. boulardi is a Mediterranean parasitoid species showing a recent range expansion to the north (in France). The LbFV virus manipulates the behaviour of females, increasing their tendency to lay additional eggs in already parasitized Drosophila larvae (superparasitism). This is beneficial for the virus because it allows the virus to be horizontally transferred during superparasitism. We show that LbFV prevalence is very high in central populations, intermediate in marginal populations and almost absent from newly established peripheral populations of L. boulardi. We failed to detect any influence of temperature and diapause on viral transmission efficiency but we observed a clear relationship between prevalence and parasitoid density, and between parasitoid density and the occurrence of superparasitism, as predicted by our epidemiological model. Viral strains were all efficient at inducing the behavioural manipulation and viral gene sequencing revealed very low sequence variation. We conclude that the prevalence reached by the virus critically depends on density-dependent factors, i.e. superparasitism, underlying the selective pressures acting on the virus to manipulate the behaviour of the parasitoid.

Fleshy Fruit Removal and Nutritional Composition of Winter-fruiting Plants: a Comparison of Non-native Invasive and Native Species	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL												Invasive, non-native plants threaten forest ecosystems by reducing native plant species richness and potentially altering ecosystem processes. Seed dispersal is critical for successful invasion and range expansion by non-native plants; dispersal is likely to be enhanced if they can successfully compete with native plants for disperser services. Fruit production by non-native plants during winter (or dormant season), when native fruits and arthropods are scarce, might enhance chances of fruit consumption and seed dispersal by vertebrates. We compared the proportion and rate of fruit removal among five invasive, non-native and two native plant species that retain fruit during winter to test whether non-native fruits are readily removed and their seeds dispersed by vertebrates even where native fruit is available. We also assessed whether the nutritional content of fruit pulp affects fruit removal rates, and collected bird droppings from fecal traps to examine species and rates of seed dispersal. Most (83% to 93%) fruit was removed from all species except native Smilax rotundifolia L. (55%). Most (92%) seeds collected from bird droppings were from non-native plants (six species); only 8% were from native plants (four species). Mean fruit survival time (across species) was positively correlated with total sugar and negatively correlated with lipid. Total fruit consumed was not correlated with nutrient content. Our results indicate most fruits of tested winter-fruiting, non-native invasive plants are removed, and their seeds are dispersed. In the southern Appalachian Mountains, only a few native plant species, notably greenbriar (Smilax spp.), American holly (Ilex opaca Aiton), and sumac (Rhus spp.) retain abundant, ripe fruit during winter months, and these species tend to be patchy in their distribution. Therefore, winter fruit availability by non-native invasive plants offers an important opportunity for dispersal and range expansion, and is likely key in their successful invasion of ecosystems.																	0885-8608					JUL	2010	30	3					312	321		10.3375/043.030.0306								WOS:000280575500007

Dale			Protocols for Use of Potamogeton perfoliatus and Ruppia maritima Seeds in Large-Scale Restoration	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Restoration of submerged aquatic vegetation from seed has been hampered by a lack of information on the appropriate conditions for collecting, processing, and storing seeds prior to dispersal. Seeds must be processed and stored under conditions that maintain seed viability, meet dormancy requirements, and prevent premature germination. This study examined the effects of collection date, processing technique, aeration, storage and induction temperature and salinity, and storage period on seed germination of two mesohaline aquatic species, Potamogeton perfoliatus and Ruppia maritima. Collection date and processing technique were significant factors affecting seed yield from donor populations. Seeds of both species remained viable and germinated best when stored at 4 degrees C, and then exposed to freshwater induction conditions. However, their responses to other factors differed. Aeration during storage was necessary in order to maintain viability of P. perfoliatus seeds, whereas it was unnecessary for R. maritima seeds. Storage in freshwater at 4 degrees C prevented germination of P. perfoliatus seeds, while high salinity during cold storage was necessary to minimize premature germination of R. maritima. Mean germination time of P. perfoliatus was dependent on storage salinity; in contrast, mean germination time of R. maritima seeds was dependent on induction salinity. These differences indicate that the methods required to produce large quantities of underwater plant seed amenable to large-scale restoration efforts must be tailored to the specific requirements of individual species and must consider the range of processes from initial harvest through seed testing prior to field establishment.																	1061-2971					JUL	2010	18	4					560	573		10.1111/j.1526-100X.2010.00696.x								WOS:000279670600017

Latitudinal variation in seasonal activity and mortality in ratsnakes (Elaphe obsoleta)	ECOLOGY												The ecology of ectotherms should be particularly affected by latitude because so much of their biology is temperature dependent. Current latitudinal patterns should also be informative about how ectotherms will have to modify their behavior in response to climate change. We used data from a total of 175 adult black ratsnakes (Elaphe obsoleta) radio-tracked in Ontario, Illinois, and Texas, a latitudinal distance of > 1500 km, to test predictions about how seasonal patterns of activity and mortality should vary with latitude. Despite pronounced differences in temperatures among study locations, and despite ratsnakes in Texas not hibernating and switching from diurnal to nocturnal activity in the summer, seasonal patterns of snake activity were remarkably similar during the months that snakes in all populations were active. Rather than being a function of temperature, activity may be driven by the timing of reproduction, which appears similar among populations. Contrary to the prediction that mortality should be highest in the most active population, overall mortality did not follow a clinal pattern. Winter mortality did increase with latitude, however, consistent with temperature limiting the northern distribution of ratsnakes. This result was opposite that found in the only previous study of latitudinal variation in winter mortality in reptiles, which may be a consequence of whether or not the animals exhibit true hibernation. Collectively, these results suggest that, at least in the northern part of their range, ratsnakes should be able to adjust easily to, and may benefit from, a warmer climate, although climate-based changes to the snakes' prey or habitat, for example, could alter that prediction.																	0012-9658					JUN	2010	91	6					1860	1866		10.1890/09-1154.1								WOS:000278859700030	20583726					
J	Malan, A				Malan, Andre			Is the Torpor-Arousal Cycle of Hibernation Controlled by a Non-Temperature-Compensated Circadian Clock?	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL RHYTHMS												During the hibernation season, mammalian hibernators alternate between prolonged bouts of torpor with a reduced body temperature (Tb) and short arousals with a return to euthermy. Evidence is presented here to show that this metabolic-and also physiological and neuroanatomical-rhythm is controlled by a clock, the torpor-arousal (TA) clock. The temperature dependence of torpor bout duration in 3 species of Spermophilus (published data) may be described by assuming that the TA clock is a circadian clock (probably not the suprachiasmatic clock) that has lost its temperature compensation. This loss might result either from a permanent deletion, or more likely from a seasonal epigenetic control at the level of the clock gene machinery. This hypothesis was verified over the full Tb range on published data from 5 other species (a monotreme, a marsupial, and 3 placental mammals). In a hibernation season, instantaneous subjective time of the putative TA clock was summated over each torpor bout. For each animal, torpor bout length (TBL) was accurately predicted as a constant fraction of a subjective day, for actual durations in astronomical time varying between 4 and 13 to 20 days. The resulting temperature dependence of the interval between arousals predicts that energy expenditure over the hibernation season will be minimal when Tb is as low as possible without eliciting cold thermogenesis.

Oxygen-dependence of metabolic rate in the muscles of craniates	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY												We present evidence that oxygen consumption (VO(2)) is oxygen partial pressure (PO(2)) dependent in striated muscles and PO(2)-independent in the vasculature in representatives of three craniate taxa: two teleost fish, a hagfish and a rat. Blood vessel VO(2) displayed varying degrees of independence in a PO(2) range of 15-95 mmHg, while VO(2) by striated muscle tissue slices from all species related linearly to PO(2) between 0 and 125 mmHg, despite VO(2) rates varying greatly between species and muscle type. In salmon red muscle, lactate concentrations fell in slices incubated at a PO(2) of either 30 or 100 mmHg, suggesting aerobic rather than anaerobic metabolism. Consistent with this finding, potential energy, a proxy of ATP turnover, was PO(2)-dependent. Our data suggest that the reduction in VO(2) with falling PO(2) results in a decrease in ATP demand, suggesting that the hypoxic signal is sensed and cellular changes effected. Viability and diffusion limitation of the preparations were investigated using salmon cardiac and skeletal muscles. Following the initial PO(2) depletion, reoxygenation of the Ringer bathing salmon cardiac muscle resulted in VO(2) s that was unchanged from the first run. VO(2) increased in all muscles uncoupled with p-trifluoromethoxylphenyl-hydrazone (FCCP) and 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP). Mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase activity, quantified by reduction of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) to formazan, was constant over the course of the experiment. These three findings indicate that the tissues remained viable over time and ruled out diffusion-limitation as a constraint on VO(2).																	0174-1578					JUN	2010	180	5					715	729		10.1007/s00360-010-0455-0								WOS:000277789000009	20198373

Countergradient vs. cogradient variation in growth and diapause in a lichen-feeding moth, Eilema depressum (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae)	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY												Separating genetic and environmental causes of the latitudinal differences among populations is crucial when evaluating the potential for microevolutionary responses to the changing environment. We studied among-population and environmental components of variation in several life-history traits of a lichen-feeding moth Eilema depressum when offspring of replicate Swiss and Finnish females were reared in a common-garden factorial experiment. A partial second generation was produced only among Swiss larvae, more likely so at higher temperature regime and higher host quality, and more frequently among the offspring of particular females. Growth rates of larvae that chose the diapause development were higher in northern individuals. Our results thus reveal adaptive differences between latitudinal populations in studied life-history traits, allowing to expect rapid adaptation of the species to further environmental changes. In contrast, invariable responses of the growth rates of the larvae to temperature and host quality support the idea that some basic parameters of insect growth show a high degree of evolutionary conservatism.																	1010-061X					JUN	2010	23	6					1278	1285		10.1111/j.1420-9101.2010.01990.x								WOS:000277710100015	20456566

EMERGENCE PATTERNS AND LATITUDINAL ADAPTATIONS IN DEVELOPMENT TIME OF ODONATA IN NORTH SWEDEN AND POLAND	ODONATOLOGICA												Using exuviae, data are presented on emergence dates of dragonflies from northern Sweden and northwestern Poland. The 17 spp. sampled in Sweden showed considerable overlap in emergence periods. In Sweden, Leucorrhinia rubicunda was the first sp. to emerge (May 31)and Sympetrum danae the last (July 19). A comparison of first dates of emergence of spp. in Sweden and Poland showed a difference between 9 and 30 days, with all Polish spp. emerging first. Compared to spring species, summer species and obligate univoltine summer species showed less difference in first date of emergence between Swedish and Polish populations. In a laboratory experiment Leucorrhinia dubia was reared from both regions from the egg to final instar larva under northern Swedish and northwestern Polish photoperiods. Swedish larvae developed faster under a northern Swedish photoperiod compared to a northwestern Polish photoperiod. However, no such difference in development was found for northwestern Polish larvae. This suggests that there are genetic differences between both populations in response to photoperiod. The results are discussed in the context of compensation of larval development of northern populations in relation to photoperiod.

Overwintering Physiology and Hibernacula Microclimates of Blanchard's Cricket Frogs at Their Northwestern Range Boundary	COPEIA												Blanchard's Cricket Frogs (Acris crepitans blanchardi) in the central portion of their range show minimal capacities for freezing tolerance and survive overwinter by using terrestrial hibernacula where they avoid freezing. However, frogs may exhibit greater freeze-tolerance capacity at high latitude range limits, where winter climate is more severe. We studied freezing tolerance, glucose mobilization during freezing, and hibernacula microclimates of cricket frogs in southeastern South Dakota, at the northwestern limit of their range. Cricket frogs from South Dakota generally survived freezing exposure at -1.5 to -2.5 degrees C for 6-h periods (80% survival), but uniformly died when exposed to these same temperatures for 24-h freezing bouts. Hepatic glucose levels and phosphorylase a activities increased significantly during freezing, but hepatic glucose levels during freezing remained low, only reaching levels approximating those prior to freezing in freeze-tolerant species. Moreover, muscle glucose and hepatic glycogen levels did not vary with freezing, suggesting little mobilization of glucose from hepatic glycogen stores during freezing, contrasting with patterns in freeze-tolerant frogs. Temperatures in soil cracks and burrows potentially used for hibernacula were variable, with some sites remaining above the freezing point of the body fluids throughout the winter, some sites dropping below the freezing point for only short periods, and some sites dropping below the freezing point for extended periods. These data suggest that cricket frogs in South Dakota, as in other portions of their range, survive overwinter by locating hibernacula that prevent freezing, although their toleration of short freezing bouts may expand the range of suitable hibernacula. These data also suggest that overwinter mortality may be high at the northern range boundary and might limit cricket frogs from expanding their range northward.																	0045-8511					MAY 20	2010		2					247	253		10.1643/CP-09-121								WOS:000278428900009

Spring emergence of Canadian Delia radicum and synchronization with its natural enemy, Aleochara bilineata	CANADIAN ENTOMOLOGIST												To characterize time of spring emergence following post-diapause development, Delia radicum (L.) (Diptera: Anthomyiidae) from Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and southwestern Ontario were collected in fall, maintained over winter at 1 degrees C, then transferred to higher constant temperatures until adult emergence. At each location there were "early" and "late" phenotypes. Truncated normal models of temperature dependency of development rate were fitted for each phenotype from each location. We provide the first evidence of geographic variation in the criteria separating these phenotypes. Separation criteria and models for early and late phenotypes at the two prairie locations, approximately 700 km apart, were indistinguishable, but differed from those for Ontario. Prairie phenotypes developed more slowly than Ontario phenotypes, and more prairie individuals were of the late phenotype. Poor synchronization of spring emergence could impair predation of D. radicum eggs by adult Aleochara bilineata Gyllenhal (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae). Aleochara bilineata from Manitoba were reared and development rates modelled as for D. radicum. Models of development rates for the two species, when combined with simulated soil temperatures for two prairie locations, suggest that emergence of adult A. bilineata is well synchronized with availability of D. radicum eggs in prairie canola.																	0008-347X					MAY-JUN	2010	142	3					234	249		10.4039/n09-060								WOS:000279130400005

The results showed that the diapause intensity for eggs or T. emma was stronger for the Changsha population at lower latitude than for the Sihong and Jining populations at higher latitudes, whereas no significant difference in the egg diapause intensity was found between the Sihong and Jining populations. A latitudinal increase in egg threshold temperature was observed for the Changsha, Sihong, and Jining populations at 12.2 degrees C, 14.0 degrees C, and 14.7 degrees C, respectively, while an inverse trend in egg effective temperatures was observed in the three populations at 240.1, 215.6, and 196.1 day-degrees, respectively. The results revealed distinct geographical clines among local populations of T. emma in several key life history characteristics for the egg stage, including diapause intensity, threshold temperature and effective temperature, suggesting that the species has evolved different life history strategies in accordance with local climate conditions.																	0013-872X					MAY-JUN	2010	121	3					236	242										WOS:000295426700004

Thermal tolerance and potential distribution of Carvalhotingis visenda (Hemiptera: Tingidae), a biological control agent for cat's claw creeper, Macfadyena unguis-cati (Bignoniaceae)	BULLETIN OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH												The specialist tingid, Carvalhotingis visenda, is a biological control agent for cat's claw creeper, Macfadyena unguis-cati (Bignoniaceae). Cat's claw creeper is an invasive liana with a wide climatic tolerance, and for biological control to be effective the tingid must survive and develop over a range of temperatures. We evaluated the effect of constant temperatures (0-45 degrees C) on the survival and development of C. visetula. Adults showed tolerance for wider temperature ranges (0-45 degrees C), but oviposition, egg hatching and nymphal development were all affected by both high (>30 degrees C) and low (<20 degrees C) temperatures. Temperatures between 20 degrees C and 30 degrees C are the most favourable for adult survival, oviposition, egg hatching and nymphal development. The ability of adults and nymphs to survive for a few days at high (40 degrees C and 45 degrees C) and low (0 degrees C and 5 degrees C) temperatures suggest that extreme temperature events, which usually occur for short durations (hours) in cat's claw creeper infested regions in Queensland and New South Wales states are not likely to affect the tingid population. The potential number of generations (egg to adult) the tingid can complete in a year in Australia ranged from three to eight, with more generations in Queensland than in New South Wales.																	0007-4853	1475-2670				APR	2010	100	2					159	166		10.1017/S0007485309006932								WOS:000276539000005	19419590

Egg development time was shorter under northern photoperiod regimes for both populations. However, the northern latitude population showed a higher phenotypic plasticity response to photoperiod compared with the southern latitude population, suggesting a genetic difference in egg development time in response to photoperiod. 3. Larvae from both latitudes expressed shorter larval development time and faster growth rates under northern photoperiod regimes. There was no difference in phenotypic plastic response between northern and southern latitude populations with regard to development time. 4. Data on field collected adults showed that adult sizes decreased with an increase in latitude. This adult size difference was a genetically fixed trait, as the same size difference between populations was also found when larvae were reared in the laboratory. 5. The results suggest phenotypic plasticity responses in life history traits to photoperiod, but also genetic differences between north and south latitude populations in response to photoperiod, which indicates the presence of a latitudinal compensating mechanism that is triggered by a photoperiod.

Suitability of Different Lepidopteran Host Species for Development of Bracon hebetor (Hymenoptera: Braconidae)	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												Bracon hebetor Say (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) is a gregarious larval ectoparasitoid of several species of Lepidoptera that are associated with stored products. The suitability of 12 potential lepidopteran host species representing four families was studied in this study for the development and reproduction of B. hebetor. The Lepidoptera species used were the Indianmeal moth, Mocha inter-punctella (Hubner), Mediterranean flour moth, Ephestia kuehniella (Zeller), almond moth, E. cautella (Walker), rice moth, Corcyra cephalonica (Walker), navel orangeworm, Amyelois transitella (Stainton), greater wax moth (laboratory reared and commercial), Galleria mellonella (Linnaeus) (all Pyralidae); tobacco budworm, Hetiothis virescens (Fabricus), corn earworm, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie), beet armyworm, Spodoptera exigua (Hubner) (all Noctuidae); webbing clothes moth, Tineola bisselliella (Hummel) (Tineidae); and Angoumois grain moth, Sitotroga cerealella (Olivier) (Gelichiidae). Experiments were conducted using petri dishes (100 by 15 mm) as experimental arenas at 29 +/- 1 degrees C, 65 +/- 5% RH, and a photoperiod of 14:10 (L: D) h. B. hebetor females were introduced singly into arenas and given a full-grown host larva every day for 5 consecutive d. Paralysis of the host larvae and oviposition by B. hebetor females were significantly affected by host species. The cumulative fecundity in the 5-d period was highest on A. transitella (106.42 +/- 5.19) and lowest on T. bisselliella (9.64 +/- 1.28). The egg-to-adult survivorship and progeny sex ratio were also significantly affected by the host species. The highest percentage of parasitoid survival to the adult stage was on A. transitella (84.07 +/- 2.26) and zero on T bisselliella. Egg to adult development time was shortest on E. cautella (9.75 +/- 0.25 d) and longest on G. mellonella (12.63 +/- 0.28 d). Results from these studies suggest that B. hebetor females can use a wide range of lepidopteran hosts for paralysis and oviposition. However, B. hebetor cannot necessarily develop and reproduce on all host species that it can paralyze and oviposit on, and optimum reproduction is with the stored-product pyralid hosts.																	0046-225X	1938-2936				APR	2010	39	2					449	458		10.1603/EN09213								WOS:000276476300023	20388274					
J	Center, TD; Dray, FA				Center, Ted D.; Dray, F. Allen, Jr.			Bottom-up control of water hyacinth weevil populations: do the plants regulate the insects?	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												P>1. Nutrient availability varies widely in aquatic systems and is likely to profoundly affect the outcomes of plant-herbivore interactions in aquatic environments. This has implications in programmes aimed at the biological control of water weeds. We hypothesized that nutrient flux seasonally affects ovarian development of two specialist weevil species, Neochetina eichhorniae and Neochetina bruchi, thereby influencing population growth on the floating plant Eichhornia crassipes. 2. We also hypothesized that the weevils differed in their sensitivities to nutritional quality and interacted differently depending on host quality. 3. To test these hypotheses, we cultured E. crassipes plants under 20 fertilizer regimens then introduced reproductively dormant, over-wintering female weevils as single or mixed species populations. They were later retrieved and dissected to ascertain ovarian status. F-1 progeny was extracted biweekly to compare fecundity with population growth. 4. Ovaries regained functionality and the reproductive proportion of the population increased with fertilizer rate as did the fecundity of reproductive individuals. F-1 progeny increased exponentially from 7 to over 300 weevils tank-1 in the highest fertilizer treatment. 5. Mixed species treatments produced more offspring under high fertilizer rates than single species treatments (236 +/- 32 mixed vs. 155 +/- 25 N. bruchi or 170 +/- 33 N. eichhorniae pure). Neochetina eichhorniae was more productive throughout than N. bruchi, but N. bruchi performed nearly as well in high fertilizer treatments. 6. Ratios of the two species remained consistent whether in single or mixed species populations suggesting a lack of interspecific interference. However, N. eichhorniae seemed more adaptable to a wider range of plant quality and more tolerant of lower nutritional circumstances. 7. Synthesis and applications. The coupling of reproductive status of the parental generation with the population response of the F-1 generation indicates that plant quality drives population growth of both weevil species, demonstrating bottom-up regulation. This largely explains the variable performance of these weevils as biological control agents. These results emphasize the importance of considering bottom-up regulation in evaluating host range trials, predicting efficacy and in post-release evaluations. In addition, they suggest that partial herbicide treatments to accomplish phased removal of infestations could enhance the quality of the remaining plants, thereby better integrating biological control into current E. crassipes management systems.																	0021-8901					APR	2010	47	2					329	337		10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01769.x								WOS:000275334400011

Control of Overwintering Filbertworm (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) Larvae With Steinernema carpocapsae	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY												Filbertworm, Cydia latiferreana (Walsingham) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), is a key insect pest associated with hazelnuts, Corylus avellana L. (Fagales: Betulaceae), in North America. This study investigated the feasibility of entomopathogenic nematodes as an alternative strategy for filbertworm control. Laboratory and field experiments were conducted between October 2007 and May 2008 in Benton County, OR, to evaluate the ability of the nematode Steinernema carpocapsae (Weiser) (Rhabditida: Steinernematidae) to infect filbertworm larvae and pupae. The susceptibility of larvae with and without hibernacula as well as pupae to S. carpocapsae was tested in laboratory bioassays using nematode concentrations between 40 and 200 infective juveniles (IJs) per cm(2). Percentage of nematode infection was not significantly affected by the presence of hibernacula (infection range, 90-92%) compared with larvae without hibernacula (80-95%), or by pupal stage (50-75%) compared with larvae (65-75%). In additional field trials, the effect of nematode rate, water application rate, and orchard floor cover on nematode efficacy was determined in October 2007 and May/June 2008. Sentinel filbertworm larvae in plots with either bare soil or debris (leaves, twigs, husks, and blank nuts) were treated with S. carpocapsae at rates ranging from 40 to 150 Us per cm2 applied in 75 or 190 ml/m(2) water. Average filbertworm mortality ranged from 2 to 11% and from 50 to 78% in October and May, respectively. Larval mortality increased with increasing nematode concentration, but was not significantly affected by water application rate or orchard floor cover. Our experiments suggest that S. carpocapsae can play a role in the control of filbertworm larvae overwintering on the orchard floor.																	0022-0493					APR	2010	103	2					416	422		10.1603/EC09255								WOS:000276169800028	20429457

Such selection is particularly likely to act on traits expressed early in development since early survival is necessary for the expression of adaptive phenotypes later in life. Genetic studies of fitness under field conditions, however, seldom include the earliest developmental stages. Using a new set of recombinant inbred lines, we present a study of the genetic basis of fitness variation in Arabidopsis thaliana in which genotypes, environments, and geographic location were manipulated to study total lifetime fitness, beginning with the seed stage. Large-effect quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for fitness changed allele frequency and closely approached 90% in some treatments within a single generation. These QTLs colocated with QTLs for germination phenology when seeds were dispersed following a schedule of a typical winter annual, and they were detected in two geographic locations at different latitudes. Epistatically interacting loci affected both fitness and germination in many cases. QTLs for field germination phenology colocated with known QTLs for primary dormancy induction as assessed in laboratory tests, including the candidate genes DOG1 and DOG6. Therefore fitness, germination phenology, and primary dormancy are genetically associated at the level of specific chromosomal regions and candidate loci. Genes associated with the ability to arrest development at early life stages and assess environmental conditions are thereby likely targets of intense natural selection early in the colonization process.

Whether admixture constrains or facilitates adaptation from standing variation is largely unknown, especially in ecological keystone or foundation species. We examined patterns of neutral and adaptive population divergence in Populus tremula L., a widespread forest tree, using mapped molecular genetic markers. We detected the genetic signature of postglacial admixture between a Western and an Eastern lineage of P. tremula in Scandinavia, an area suspected to represent a zone of postglacial contact for many species of animals and plants. Stringent divergence-based neutrality tests provided clear indications for locally varying selection at the European scale. Six of 12 polymorphisms under selection were located less than 1 kb away from the nearest gene predicted by the Populus trichocarpa genome sequence. Few of these loci exhibited a signature of 'selective sweeps' in diversity-based tests, which is to be expected if adaptation occurs primarily from standing variation. In Scandinavia, admixture explained genomic patterns of ancestry and the nature of clinal variation and strength of selection for bud set, a phenological trait of great adaptive significance in temperate trees, measured in a common garden trial. Our data provide a hitherto missing direct link between past range shifts because of climatic oscillations, and levels of standing variation currently available for selection and adaptation in a terrestrial foundation species.

J	Bale, JS; Hayward, SAL				Bale, J. S.; Hayward, S. A. L.			Insect overwintering in a changing climate	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY												Insects are highly successful animals inhabiting marine, freshwater and terrestrial habitats from the equator to the poles. As a group, insects have limited ability to regulate their body temperature and have thus required a range of strategies to support life in thermally stressful environments, including behavioural avoidance through migration and seasonal changes in cold tolerance. With respect to overwintering strategies, insects have traditionally been divided into two main groups: freeze tolerant and freeze avoiding, although this simple classification is underpinned by a complex of interacting processes, i.e. synthesis of ice nucleating agents, cryoprotectants, antifreeze proteins and changes in membrane lipid composition. Also, in temperate and colder climates, the overwintering ability of many species is closely linked to the diapause state, which often increases cold tolerance ahead of temperature-induced seasonal acclimatisation. Importantly, even though most species can invoke one or both of these responses, the majority of insects die from the effects of cold rather than freezing. Most studies on the effects of a changing climate on insects have focused on processes that occur predominantly in summer (development, reproduction) and on changes in distributions rather than winter survival per se. For species that routinely experience cold stress, a general hypothesis would be that predicted temperature increases of 1 degrees C to 5 degrees C over the next 50-100 years would increase winter survival in some climatic zones. However, this is unlikely to be a universal effect. Negative impacts may occur if climate warming leads to a reduction or loss of winter snow cover in polar and sub-polar areas, resulting in exposure to more severe air temperatures, increasing frequency of freeze-thaw cycles and risks of ice encasement. Likewise, whilst the dominant diapause-inducing cue (photoperiod) will be unaffected by global climate change, higher temperatures may modify normal rates of development, leading to a de-coupling of synchrony between diapause-sensitive life-cycle stages and critical photoperiods for diapause induction. In terms of climate warming and potential heat stress, the most recent predictions of summer temperatures in Europe of 40 degrees C or higher in 50-75 years, are close to the current upper lethal limit of some insects. Long-term data sets on insect distributions and the timing of annual migrations provide strong evidence for 'positive' responses to higher winter temperatures over timescales of the past 20-50 years in North America, Europe and Asia.

Microarrays Reveal Early Transcriptional Events during the Termination of Larval Diapause in Natural Populations of the Mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii	PLOS ONE												Background: The mosquito Wyeomyia smithii overwinters in a larval diapause that is initiated, maintained and terminated by day length (photoperiod). We use a forward genetic approach to investigate transcriptional events involved in the termination of diapause following exposure to long-days. Methods/Principal Findings: We incorporate a novel approach that compares two populations that differentially respond to a single day length. We identify 30 transcripts associated with differential response to day length. Most genes with a previously annotated function are consistent with their playing a role in the termination of diapause, in downstream developmental events, or in the transition from potentially oxygen-poor to oxygen-rich environments. One gene emerges from three separate forward genetic screens as a leading candidate for a gene contributing to the photoperiodic timing mechanism itself (photoperiodic switch). We name this gene photoperiodic response gene 1 (ppdrg1). WsPpdrg1 is up-regulated under long-day response conditions, is located under a QTL for critical photoperiod and is associated with critical photoperiod after 25 generations of recombination from a cross between extreme phenotypes. Conclusions: Three independent forward genetic approaches identify WsPpdrg1 as a gene either involved in the photoperiodic switch mechanism or very tightly linked to a gene that is. We conclude that continued forward genetic approaches will be central to understanding not only the molecular basis of photoperiodism and diapause, but also the evolutionary potential of temperate and polar animal populations when confronted with rapid climate change.

Genetic Control of Photoperiod Sensitivity in Maize Revealed by Joint Multiple Population Analysis	GENETICS												Variation in maize for response to photoperiod is related to geographical adaptation in the species. Maize possesses homologs of many genes identified as regulators of flowering time in other species, but their relation to the natural variation for photoperiod response in maize is unknown. Candidate gene sequences were mapped in four populations created by crossing two temperate inbred lines to two photoperiod-sensitive tropical inbreds. Whole-genome scans were conducted by high-density genotyping of the populations, which were phenotyped over 3 years in both short- and long-day environments. Joint multiple population analysis identified genomic regions controlling photoperiod responses in flowering time, plant height, and total leaf number. Four key genome regions controlling photoperiod response across populations were identified, referred to as ZmPR1-4. Functional allelic differences within these regions among phenotypically similar founders suggest distinct evolutionary trajectories for photoperiod adaptation in maize. These regions encompass candidate genes CCA/LHY, CONZ1, CRY2, ELF4, GHD7, VGT1, HY1/SE5, TOC1/PRR7/PPD-1, PIF3, ZCN8, and ZCN19.

Among insect species that experience seasonal variation in environmental conditions, such as in temperate latitudes, age may also have indirect effects on the metabolic rate. We examined the effect of age on the resting metabolic rate of Leptinotarsa decemlineata during 11 days after adult emergence by using flow-through respirometry. Age had a significant mass-independent effect on metabolic rate of beetles. A twofold increase in metabolic rate occurred during the first 2 days of adult life after which metabolic rate decreased with age relatively slowly. Ten day-old adult beetles had a metabolic rate similar to newly emerged beetles. The beetles have to be able to complete their development and prepare for overwintering during the relatively short favourable summer periods. Therefore, the observed pattern in metabolic rate may reflect physiological changes in the pre-diapause beetles adapted to temperate latitudes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Identifying alleles of Viviparous-1B associated with pre-harvest sprouting in micro-core collections of Chinese wheat germplasm	MOLECULAR BREEDING												Wheat pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) is an undesired trait, which often reduces yield and downgrades end-use quality of grain. Viviparous-1B (Vp-1B), a regulator gene located on chromosome 3B, has previously been proved to be involved in inducing grain dormancy of wheat. In order to obtain some new or useful alleles associated with PHS tolerance of white-grained wheat, we developed a gene-specific marker (Vp1-b2) to identify allelic variations of Vp-1B using denaturing PAGE in micro-core collections of Chinese wheat and landraces. As a main component observed genetic variation for PHS, seed dormancy evaluated by germination index (GI) was determined at dough-yellow ripening stage in the present study. The results indicated that six alleles of Vp-1B, in our study, were discovered among 276 Chinese wheat varieties. Of these alleles, two variants were validated to be novel alleles and designated as Vp-1Be and Vp-1Bf, respectively. By investigating the association between allelic variations of Vp-1B and seed dormancy, we found allele of Vp-1Ba always inclined to weak seed dormancy and susceptibility to PHS. Up to 62.2% genotypes carrying the allele had high GI value with a range of 0.51-1.00, only 14.4% genotypes had low GI value under 0.30. On the contrary, other variants such as Vp-1Bb, Vp-1Bc, Vp-1Bd, Vp-1Be and Vp-1Bf mostly occurred in varieties with higher PHS tolerance, which average of GI values were 0.204, 0.227, 0.296, 0.256 and 0.186, respectively. In Chinese wheat germplasms, Vp-1Ba and Vp-1Bc showed the most widespread distribution followed by Vp-1Bb; other alleles fell into less used varieties. Our research confirmed rich allelic variation of Vp-1B occurred in micro-core collections of Chinese wheat and landraces, which may be useful for improving PHS tolerance as breeding parents.																	1380-3743					MAR	2010	25	3					481	490		10.1007/s11032-009-9346-z								WOS:000274853300011						
J	Syphard, AD; Franklin, J				Syphard, Alexandra D.; Franklin, Janet			Species traits affect the performance of species distribution models for plants in southern California	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions: To what extent do plant species traits, including life history, life form, and disturbance response characteristics, affect the degree to which species distributions are determined by physical environmental factors? Is the strength of the relationship between species distribution and environment stronger in some disturbance-response types than in others? Location: California southwest ecoregion, USA. Methods: We developed species distribution models (SDMs) for 45 plant species using three primary modeling methods (GLMs, GAMs, and Random Forests). Using AUC as a performance measure of prediction accuracy, and measure of the strength of species-environment correlations, we used regression analyses to compare the effects of fire disturbance response type, longevity, dispersal mechanism, range size, cover, species prevalence, and model type. Results: Fire disturbance response type explained more variation in model performance than any other variable, but other species and range characteristics were also significant. Differences in prediction accuracy reflected variation in species life history, disturbance response, and rarity. AUC was significantly higher for longer-lived species, found at intermediate levels of abundance, and smaller range sizes. Models performed better for shrubs than sub-shrubs and perennial herbs. The disturbance response type with the highest SDM accuracy was obligate-seeding shrubs with ballistic dispersal that regenerate via fire-cued germination from a dormant seed bank. Conclusions: The effect of species characteristics on predictability of species distributions overrides any differences in modeling technique. Prediction accuracy may be related to how a suite of species characteristics co-varies along environmental gradients. Including disturbance response was important because SDMs predict the realized niche. Classification of plant species into disturbance response types may provide a strong framework for evaluating performance of SDMs.																	1100-9233					FEB 10	2010	21	1					177	189		10.1111/j.1654-1103.2009.01133.x								WOS:000273668300017

The Effects of Extreme Seasonality of Climate and Day Length on the Activity Budget and Diet of Semi-Commensal Chacma Baboons (Papio ursinus) in the Cape Peninsula of South Africa	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY												We examined the effects of extreme seasonality on the activity budget and diet of wild chacnia baboons with access to a high-quality, human-derived food source. The Cape Peninsula of South Africa is unusual among nonhuman primate habitats due to its seasonal extremes in day length and climate. Winter days are markedly shorter and colder than summer days but have higher rainfall and higher primary production of annually flowering plants. This combination of fewer daylight hours but higher rainfall is substantially different from the ecological constraints faced by both equatorial baboon populations and those living in temperate climates with summer rainfall. We sought to understand how these seasonal differences affect time budgets of food-enhanced troops in comparison to both other food-enhanced troops and wild foraging troops at similar latitudes. Our results revealed significant seasonal differences in activity budget and diet, a finding that contrasts with other baboon populations with access to high-return anthropogenic foods. Similar to nonprovisioned troops at similar latitudes, troop members spent more time feeding, socializing, and traveling during the long summer days compared to the short winter days, and proportionately more time feeding and less time resting in summer compared to winter. Summer diets consisted mainly of fynbos and nonindigenous foods, whereas winter diets were dominated by annually flowering plants (mainly grasses) and ostrich pellets raided from a nearby ostrich farm. In this case, food enhancement may have effectively exaggerated seasonal differences in activity budgets by providing access to a high-return food (ostrich pellets) that was spatially and temporally coincident with abundant winter fallback foods (grasses). The frequent use of both alien vegetation and high-return, human-derived foods highlights the dietary flexibility of baboons as a key element of their overall success in rapidly transforming environments such as the South African Cape Peninsula.

Reproductive Activity and Survivorship of Liriomyza sativae (Diptera: Agromyzidae) at Different Temperatures and Relative Humidity Levels	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												We studied a population of Liriomyza sativae Blanchard (Diptera: Agromyzidae) identified by morphological and molecular techniques from the semiarid region of the Brazilian northeast. The influence of temperature and relative humidity on the survival and reproductive parameters of L. sativae in cowpeas (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp.) (Fabales: Fabaceae) was evaluated. We used temperatures of 18, 20, 22, 25, 28, 30, and 32 +/- 1 degrees C (50 +/- 10% RH) and relative humidity values of 30,50,70, and 90 +/- 10% (25 +/- 1 degrees C) under a 14 L:10 D photoperiod. Adult longevity decreased as temperature and relative humidity increased and was greater, in general, for females. The preoviposition and oviposition periods also decreased as temperature increased, whereas relative humidity only caused reductions in the oviposition period at higher levels. Fecundity was similar in the range from 18 to 30 degrees C but decreased at 32 degrees C with respect to relative humidity; the best performances of L. sativae occurred at lower levels. The pattern of oviposition rate changed with temperature and relative humidity. Regardless of temperature and relative humidity, L, sativae laid between 75 and 92% of its eggs on the adaxial surface of the cowpea leaves. This information will be highly useful to design a leafminer production system aimed at the multiplication of natural enemies, as well as for pest management in the field.

The ecology of Eurotestudo h. hermanni in a mesic area of southern Italy: first evidence of sperm storage	ETHOLOGY ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION												The daily and annual cycle, the activity pattern, and the spatial behaviour of a population of Eurotestudo h. hermanni were investigated in a mesophilous wooded biotope of southern Italy. A total of eight animals', four males and four females, were fitted with transmitters and monitored for an entire season of activity. Daily activity patterns varied in relation to the season and the daily cycle. Basking activity was dominant in May-June and September, while feeding behaviour peaked in June and October, Mating behaviour was only observed in late summer, while evidence of egg laying was found from late spring, suggesting sperm storage by females. Size of home ranges varied between 1.0 and 3.3 ha for females and from 0.5 and 2.8 ha for males. A wider overlap was observed between home ranges of males and females, Suggesting a higher tolerance toward the other sex. Tortoises monitored for the entire activity period showed homing behaviour towards their hibernation sites, confirming the excellent orientation skills of the species.

J	Flenner, I; Richter, O; Suhling, F				Flenner, Ida; Richter, Otto; Suhling, Frank			Rising temperature and development in dragonfly populations at different latitudes	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. For modelling the future ecological responses to climate change, data on individual species and on variation within and between populations from different latitudes are required. 2. We examined life cycle regulation and growth responses to temperature in Mediterranean and temperate populations of a widespread European odonate, Orthetrum cancellatum. In an experiment, offspring from individual females from different parts of the range were kept separately to elucidate differences between families. 3. The experiment was run outdoors at 52 degrees N at a natural photoperiod for almost a year. We used four temperature regimes, ambient (i.e. following local air temperature) and ambient temperature increased by 2, 4 and 6 degrees C, to mimic future temperature rise. A mathematical model was used to categorise the type of seasonal regulation and estimate parameters of the temperature response curve. 4. Growth rate varied significantly with temperature sum, survival and geographic origin, as well as with family. Offspring of all females from the temperate part of the range had a life cycle with a 12 h day-length threshold necessary to induce diapause (i.e. diapause was induced once day length fell below 12 h). By contrast, Mediterranean families had a 10 h threshold or had an unregulated life cycle allowing winter growth. The temperature response did not significantly differ between populations, but varied between families with a greater variation in the optimum temperature for growth in the Mediterranean population. 5. The variation in seasonal regulation leads to a diversity in voltinism patterns within species, ranging from bivoltine to semivoltine along a latitudinal gradient. Given that the type of seasonal regulation is genetically fixed, rising temperatures will not allow faster than univoltine development in temperate populations. We discuss the consequences of our results in the light of rising temperature in central Europe.

Local adaptation at the range peripheries of Sitka spruce	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY												High-dispersal rates in heterogeneous environments and historical rapid range expansion can hamper local adaptation; however, we often see clinal variation in high-dispersal tree species. To understand the mechanisms of the species' distribution, we investigated local adaptation and adaptive plasticity in a range-wide context in Sitka spruce, a wind-pollinated tree species that has recently expanded its range after glaciations. Phenotypic traits were observed using growth chamber experiments that mimicked temperature and photoperiodic regimes from the limits of the species realized niche. Bud phenology exhibited parallel reaction norms among populations; however, putatively adaptive plasticity and strong divergent selection were seen in bud burst and bud set timing respectively. Natural selection appears to have favoured genotypes that maximize growth rate during available frost-free periods in each environment. We conclude that Sitka spruce has developed local adaptation and adaptive plasticity throughout its range in response to current climatic conditions despite generally high pollen flow and recent range expansion.																	1010-061X					FEB	2010	23	2					249	258		10.1111/j.1420-9101.2009.01910.x								WOS:000273632800002	20021549

These two seed-eating weevils reproduce on Ulex plant species with different fruiting phenologies. E. ulicis lays eggs in spring and overwinters as an adult while E. lemovicinum lays eggs in autumn and overwinters as a larva. Adult weevils were collected in natural populations of Brittany (Western France) and characterized with morphological and molecular tools before experiments. We showed that both weevil species exhibited low supercooling points (SCPs) with mean seasonal values below -17 degrees C. Fresh mass, moisture content and sex were not correlated to supercooling ability. Weevils died upon freezing and the lower lethal temperatures (LLT) were within the range of SCP, indicating that both species are freezing intolerant. Comparison between species for SCP, LLT and survival to exposure at -8 degrees C in winter showed a higher cold resistance for E. ulicis than for E. lemovicinum. In addition, the seasonal evolution of cold hardiness differed depending on the species. These features suggest that response to cold of weevils is linked to their life cycles, and thus to the life history of their host plants. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Identification of a candidate adaptive polymorphism for Drosophila life history by parallel independent clines on two continents	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Life history traits are critical components of fitness and frequently reflect adaptive responses to environmental pressures. However, few genes that contribute to natural life history variation have been identified. Insulin signalling mediates the determination of life history traits in many organisms, and single gene manipulation in Drosophila melanogaster suggests that individual genes in the pathway have the potential to produce major effects on these quantitative traits. We evaluated allelic variation at two insulin signalling genes, the Insulin-like Receptor (InR) and its substrate, chico, in natural populations of D. melanogaster. We found different patterns of variation: InR shows evidence of positive selection and clines in allele frequency across latitude; chico exhibits neutral patterns of evolution. The clinal patterns at InR are replicated between North America and Australia, showing striking similarity in the distribution of specific alleles and the rate at which allele frequencies change across latitude. Moreover, we identified a polymorphism at InR that appears to be functionally significant and consistent with hypothetical patterns of selection across geography. This polymorphism provides new characterization of genic regions of functionality within InR, and is likely a component in a suite of genes and traits that respond adaptively to climatic variation.

A mechanistic model of nutritional control of protein synthesis in animal tissues	JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY												Regulation of mRNA translation has been held responsible for effects of diet, age, alcohol, hormones, hibernation, disease and hypoxia on protein synthesis in animal tissues. Dietary effects are due to concentrations of amino acids and insulin in circulation that affect activities of two key translational regulators, eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (172) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein I (Bp). To construct a platform for prediction of global protein synthesis to nutritional stimuli, a dynamic, mechanistic model of translational control in whole tissues was developed. The model was composed of a set of differential equations which describe the dynamics of I I state variables: tRNA and acyl-tRNA for leucine (Leu), limiting (Laa) and other amino acids (Oaa), inactivated F2 with GDP (F2d), activated F2 with GTP (F2t), F4e, Bp and its complex with F4e (4eBp), available rnRNA start codons (AUG), and active ribosomes (Arib). Material was assumed to flow from one variable to another according to mass-action kinetics or Michaelis-Menten form. Uncharged tRNA inhibit GTP exchange on eIF2, and free amino acids and insulin inhibit reversible sequestration of F4e by Bp. Initial conditions and parameters were set for a skeletal muscle fractional synthesis rate of 10%/d and ribosome transit time of 80 s. Between amino acid concentrations of 500 and 4000 x 10(3) nM, protein synthesis increased from 0.9 to 11.7%/d at 0 mu U/mL insulin, and from 5.0 to 12.8%/d at 30 mu U/mL insulin. Predicted responses to graded levels of a deficient amino acid were asymptotic. A single parameter accomodated differences between tissues in insulin sensitivity. Seven parameters must be changed to simulate initiation and elongation rates in more active tissues such as liver, or in tissues of older mature animals. An increase in uncharged tRNA during insulin stimulation highlighted the physiological importance of coordinated regulation of amino acid supply by insulin. In conclusion, the regulation of F4e release from Bp by Ins and Leu, and of F2d recycling by uncharged tRNA can be tied together to describe a wide range of FSR values across tissues and physiological states.

Embryonic development is stalled during hibernation by delayed implantation of the blastocyst As a result, limb bud stage embryos (CS 13) are first noted in other South African populations in mid-September The timing of these reproductive events for the Dc Hoop population is similar with bats arriving at the maternity roosts in September and embryos at the limb bud stage (CS 13) being noted in this month.

The development and reproductive biology of this economically important insect species were studied under greenhouse and laboratory conditions during the spring-summer and fall-winter and at different rearing densities. The greenhouse wits heated during the cool months to match summer temperatures and photoperiods were enhanced artificially. Longevity wits affected by sex and season, with winter individuals living significantly longer than summer males (6.5-fold) and females (two-fold). Vitellogenesis was delayed in fall female H. vitripennis and a higher variability in lifetime fecundities wits also observed. Longevity and the factors influencing it such as environmental conditions and availability of food sources are key factors determining fecundity in H. vitripennis. Offspring performance (developmental time, survival) wits moderate during the cool months, although development of nymphs to adulthood was approximate to 13% greater. Rearing densities affected developmental time, survival, and egg production. Egg production per capita was higher in winter adults and the largest egg output was obtained at a rearing density of 100 nymphs per cage. Data presented herein Suggest that nymph and adult H. vitripennis have evolved to ensure that only resistant stages are exposed to seasonal hazards. Captive adult females entered reproductive diapause in the fall as wild females Would and despite warm greenhouse temperatures and long photoperiods and nymphal development decreased three- to six-fold during the fall-winter depending on rearing densities. These traits may be critical for the species to perpetuate in its native range.																	0013-8746					JAN	2010	103	1					57	65		10.1603/008.103.0108								WOS:000273619800008

Light, Time, and the Physiology of Biotic Response to Rapid Climate Change in Animals	ANNUAL REVIEW OF PHYSIOLOGY	ANNUAL REVIEW OF PHYSIOLOGY											Examination of temperate and polar regions of Earth shows that the nonbiological world is exquisitely sensitive to the direct effects of temperature, whereas the biological world is largely organized by light. Herein, we discuss the use of day length by animals at physiological and genetic levels, beginning with a comparative experimental study that shows the preeminent role of light in determining fitness in seasonal environments. Typically, at seasonally appropriate times, light initiates a cascade of physiological events mediating the input and interpretation of day length to the output of specific hormones that ultimately determine whether animals prepare to develop, reproduce, hibernate, enter dormancy, or migrate. The mechanisms that form the basis of seasonal time keeping and their adjustment during climate change are reviewed at the physiological and genetic levels. Future avenues for research are proposed that span basic questions from how animals transition from dependency on tropical cues to temperate cues during range expansions, to more applied questions of species survival and conservation biology during periods of climatic stress.																	0066-4278		978-0-8243-0372-3				2010	72						147	166		10.1146/annurev-physiol-021909-135837								WOS:000276085100011	20148671

Temperature, Seasonal Development and Distribution of Insects with Particular Reference to Aphids	APHID BIODIVERSITY UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE: PATTERNS AND PROCESSES					7th International Symposium on Aphids	OCT 02-07, 2005	Freemantle, AUSTRALIA					That several species of aphids can feed and coexist on the leaves of certain trees is puzzling. Of these aphids some only grow and reproduce actively in spring and autumn, and others only in summer. This temporal patterning in reproductive activity is well documented and common. In the past the summer reproductive diapause in the sycamore aphid was attributed to the low quality of the food available during summer to this and other aphids living on the leaves of deciduous trees. However, the fact that another species belonging to the same genus feeds on the same leaves and is reproductively active during summer indicates that it is unlikely that reproductive diapause in the sycamore aphid is mainly a response to poor food quality. The seasonal trend in temperature is the opposite of that in nutrition, low in spring and autumn and high in summer. A study of five species of aphids coexisting on the leaves of birch indicates that the temporal patterns in their reproductive activity are associated with differences in their thermal tolerances. The thermal tolerance range of each species, their thermal window, is approximately 20 degrees C, with some species better adapted to and therefore reproductively active when temperatures are low in spring and autumn and other species when temperatures are high in summer. Thermal windows of 20 degrees C are not specific to aphids as an analysis of similar data for 66 species from eight orders of insects indicates it is a general phenomenon. In addition, temperate species of aphid, like other poikilotherms, do better at low temperatures than subtropical and tropical species and vice versa. This indicates that it is more likely that a physiological constraint, their thermal windows, determines the seasonal dynamics and distribution of aphids, and also enables several species to coexist.																			978-90-481-8600-6				2010							129	147		10.1007/978-90-481-8601-3_8								WOS:000395360600008

Effects of maternal and offspring environmental conditions on growth, development and diapause in latitudinal yellow dung fly populations	CLIMATE RESEARCH												Extensive phenotypic plasticity can allow populations to persist in changing environments. Maternal effects represent one important but often neglected source of phenotypic plasticity. Mothers and offspring of 2 high- (northern Norway and central Sweden) and 2 low- (northern and southern Spain) latitude yellow dung fly Scathophaga stercoraria (Diptera: Scathophagidae) populations were exposed to cold (12 degrees C) and warm (18 degrees C) temperatures and to short (8 h light: 16 h dark) and long (16 h light: 8 h dark) photoperiods in a fully blocked, split-brood common garden design of 8 treatment combinations. We also considered the role of energy content and size of the eggs in producing cross-generational maternal effects on offspring diapause, development time and growth rate. The incidence of diapause strongly declined towards the south, and the northernmost population grew and developed faster in response to perceived seasonal time constraints. There was strong population-specific phenotypic plasticity of all traits in response to offspring temperature and, more weakly, to offspring photoperiod, indicating a genetic basis of plasticity as well as genetic differentiation among populations. There were additional subtle cross-generational maternal effects exerted primarily by the lipid content of the eggs, largely independent of maternal treatment and population. Phenotypic plasticity of life-history traits in the yellow dung fly is predominantly influenced by the growing conditions during larval development, but populations can also respond to changing environments via trans-generational maternal effects.																	0936-577X						2010	43	1-2					115	125		10.3354/cr00907								WOS:000280830000012

Introducing the notion of social permeability to terrorism, we study the role of passive supporters to a terrorist cause using the physical theory of percolation. A passive supporter is a normal citizen who identifies with the terrorist cause but without any direct involvement with either the terrorist group or its activities. It is an individual dormant attitude associated with a personal opinion which characterizes passive support. It does not need to be explicitly claimed. Passive supporters just do not oppose a terrorist act in case they could. Unnoticeable, most of them reject the violent aspects of terrorist acts. They only partly share the terrorist cause. The question of the range of a terrorism threat is then analyzed in terms of a percolation phenomenon within a multi-dimensional social space. Traditional terrorism is found to correspond to non-percolating situations while international terrorism is associated to worldwide percolation. Using only military means to eradicate terrorism is shown to be inefficient. Hints are given on how to diminish the terrorism threat without military destruction.																	1879-8268		978-1-60750-653-9; 978-1-60750-652-2				2010	75						175	189		10.3233/978-1-60750-653-9-175								WOS:000350547800013

GLOBAL BIODIVERSITY AND GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF DIAPAUSING AQUATIC INVERTEBRATES: THE CASE OF THE COSMOPOLITAN BRINE SHRIMP, ARTEMIA (BRANCHIOPODA, ANOSTRACA)	CRUSTACEANA												The genus Artemia comprises passively dispersed anostracan species with a distribution all around the world, except in Antarctica. We used both published and personal data to assess and update existing knowledge on the diversity and distribution of Artemia, in particular compiling also genetic and geographic information. Our results indicate there are three Artemia complexes, A. franciscana, A. tibetiana and A. salina, suggesting at least three undescribed, and one unidentified to date, highly isolated lineages, to be re-evaluated taxonomically. Additionally, at a global scale, our data set shows two large, poorly explored geographic regions in Central East Asia, which in future studies could provide interesting information on geographic speciation, the origin of parthenogenesis, and range expansion in this group. We also discuss the implications for conservation as derived from knowledge on the biodiversity (native and invasive species) and geographic distribution (i.e., identification of species/lineages, and regions occupied), which have major relevance for conservation management at the level of wetland ecosystems.

J	Friberg, M; Wiklund, C				Friberg, Magne; Wiklund, Christer			Host-plant-induced larval decision-making in a habitat/host-plant generalist butterfly	ECOLOGY												Phenotypic plasticity can be it passive response to fluctuating environmental conditions or an active and presumably adaptive (evolved) response selected for in different environments. Here we ask if the larval decision to enter diapause when reared on a host plant associated with a colder habitat is an active or a passive response to host-plant quality or suitability. We compare plasticity in larval propensity to enter diapause of the habitat generalist butterfly Leptidea sinapis and the meadow specialist Leptidea reali in a range of temperatures and long day length oil a forest plant, Lathyrus linifolius, and a meadow-associated plant, Lathyrus pratensis. The warmer meadow habitat promotes direct development whereas the colder forest habitat is conducive to dispause. Larvae of L. sinapis had a higher propensity to enter diapause when reared on the forest plant L. linifolius across all temperatures. Conversely, the propensity of L. reali to enter diapause was consistently lower and did not differ between host plants. Larval growth rates were similar between and within butterfly species and between host plants. Hence, we conclude that larval pathway decision-making in L. sinapis is an active response mediated by information from their host plants.																	0012-9658					JAN	2010	91	1					15	21		10.1890/09-0328.1								WOS:000275458500004	20380190

Flying L. lineolaris adults can move from crop to crop rapidly and easily. Little is known about the movement of L. lineolaris in or near vineyards. From May to October 2002 and 2003, 39 white sticky traps were positioned inside and at the periphery of a vineyard to study the movements of tarnished plant bug adults. Tarnished plant bug captures were most numerous from the end of July to mid August, with captures of ca. 3000 individuals in one week. During the vegetative season, most individuals were captured flying in and around the vineyard at a height of between 40 and 60 cm. The frequency with which the weeds were mown affected the numbers of adults captured. At the periphery of the vineyard, tarnished plant bug was more abundant near perennial vegetation, which tends to be stable (an apple orchard, a spruce wood), than in the vineyard where agronomic activities changed the availability of food. The tarnished plant bug adults did not hibernate in the vineyard. It is suggested that appropriate weed management will reduce the abundance of tarnished plant bugs in vineyards as it would deprive them of a number of suitable hosts for feeding and oviposition.																	1210-5759						2010	107	4					527	534		10.14411/eje.2010.060								WOS:000284434300006

Phenological and life-history responses to simulated climate change of the southern green stink bug Nezara viridula (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae)	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												The effect of simulated climate change on Nezara viridula was studied close to the species' northern range limit in Japan. Insects from the same egg masses were reared for 15 months in 10 consecutive series under quasi-natural (i.e. outdoor) conditions and in a transparent incubator, in which climate warming was simulated by adding 2.5 degrees C to the outdoor temperature. The warming strongly affected all life-history and phenological parameters. In the spring, the simulated warming advanced the timing of postdiapause body colour changes and reproduction. In the early summer, it increased egg production and accelerated nymphal development. In the late summer (the hottest season), the effect of the simulated warming was strongly deleterious: nymphs developed slowly, suffered higher mortality and had difficulties during final moulting; the emerged females were smaller, some exhibited abnormal cuticle, produced fewer eggs and had a decreased life span. In the autumn, the warming accelerated nymphal development, resulted in larger female size, affected the timing of the diapause-associated adult body colour change from green to russet and enhanced preparation for overwintering. Larger females had higher winter survival rate than smaller females. The warming strongly increased survival rate in both size classes and allowed smaller females to reach the same winter survival rate as larger females had under the quasi-natural conditions. The winter survival also differed between the green and dark-coloured females under the quasi-natural, but not under the warming conditions. However, under the warming conditions, green females survived the winter even better than dark-coloured females did under the quasi-natural conditions. The warming also shortened the life span of females from the summer generations and prolonged it in those from the autumn generation. It is concluded that even a moderate temperature increase (+ 2.5 degrees C) in the future is likely to have a complex influence upon insects, strongly affecting many of their life-history and phenological parameters.

Pattern of gonad maturation in a highly stocked population of brown trout (Salmo trutta L., 1758) from Central Italy	ITALIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												This study deals with the gonadal development and breeding season of a brown trout population in the river Metauro (Central Italy), a typical Apennine river with a short course and a highly unpredictable water flow. The results obtained showed that most individuals spawn between November and January, with a peak in December. This trend is similar to that observed in populations from Central Europe, but differs considerably from other populations at similar latitudes, which show a spawning peak between February and March. As brown trout in the river Metauro are heavily stocked with farmed strains of Atlantic origin, it is likely that in this population the reproductive characteristics have changed according to the pattern of North European populations. On the other hand, the unusual presence of mature trout in June could be the result of stocking with farmed individuals whose reproductive characteristics have been modified by breeders.																	1125-0003						2010	77	1					14	22		10.1080/11250000802589576								WOS:000278866700002						
J	Munoz, J				Munoz, Joaquin			Diversity and distribution of diapausing aquatic invertebrates in inland wetlands: An ecosystem conservation viewpoint	JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION												Inland wetlands are worldwide distributed and have been heavily impacted in recent decades by human activities such as commerce, recreation, and food sources. The direct consequences of these activities on aquatic systems are changes in hydrology and salinity alterations, and the introduction of exotic species. Recent large-scale ecological and genetic studies across several countries and continents indicate that population structure, regional endemism, and geographic speciation patterns are common in passively dispersed aquatic invertebrates contradicting previous predictions of homogeneous genetic distribution. This essay discusses the main processes that shape these patterns and determine the biodiversity and geographic distribution of diapausing aquatic invertebrates in inland wetlands. Large-scale geographical studies to describe general patterns and to understand genetic and ecological processes determining the biogeography of cosmopolitan species are needed. Further knowledge of these issues should provide invaluable information allowing development of appropriate conservation management policies for inland waters across entire ecosystems, landscapes, and geographic regions.

Dominant and Recessive Inheritance Patterns of Diapause in the Two-Spotted Spider Mite Tetranychus urticae	JOURNAL OF HEREDITY												In this study, we investigated the diapause incidence in 3 geographic strains of the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae (Acari: Tetranychidae). Under diapause-inducing conditions of 12:12 light:dark at 15 degrees C, the diapause incidence was nearly 100% in a strain from northern Japan (Sapporo), whereas it was nearly 0% in 2 strains from southern Japan (Itoman and Takanabe). Reciprocal crosses clearly showed that the nondiapause phenotype is inherited in a completely dominant manner, and no maternal effect was detected. Backcrosses to the Itoman and Takanabe strains suggested that dominant nondiapause alleles control the nondiapause phenotype. To clarify the genetic basis of nondiapause in the northern population, we also established a nondiapausing variant ("selected nondiapause" abbreviated as snd) from the Sapporo strain. Crossing experiments revealed that a single recessive allele is responsible for the nondiapause phenotype. Thus, both dominant and recessive inheritance patterns of diapause were detected in the T. urticae populations studied here.

Cryoprotection in dampwood termites (Termopsidae, Isoptera)	JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY												In contrast to the majority of the Order, the dampwood termites of the family Termopsidae found in colder regions can experience frost and snow, either in cool temperate areas at high latitudes (45 degrees), or alpine areas at high elevations (> 1000 m). This suggests that dampwood termites are adapted to cold climates. We investigated this hypothesis in two dampwood termites, Porotermes adamsoni Froggatt and Stolotermes victoriensis Hill. We measured nest temperatures and atmospheric temperatures of their alpine habitat during winter, and measured survival and recovery at subzero temperatures. We also determined the minimum temperature at which these species remain active and the LT50 values. We used a novel gas chromatographic strategy to examine eight metabolites from individuals of both species collected in winter and summer to identify possible cryoprotectants. Both A adamsoni and S. victoriensis had significantly higher levels of trehalose, a known cryoprotectant, in winter than in summer; in addition S. victoriensis also had higher levels of unsaturated fatty acid ligands in winter than in summer, consistent with patterns observed for cold adaptation in other organisms. These results are the first to reveal that dampwood termites are adapted to cold climates and use trehalose and unsaturated lipids as cryoprotectants. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this study. the effect of temperature on sporulation, germination and virulence of three isolates of N. floridana collected from T. evansi in three climatically distinct regions of Brazil and Argentina was determined. Six constant temperatures of 13 degrees C. 17 degrees C, 21 degrees C, 25 degrees C, 29 degrees C and 33 degrees C were tested for their effect on the ability of the three fungal isolates to sporulate, germinate and kill the mites. Six alternating-temperature regimes of 17-13 degrees C, 21-13 degrees C, 29-13 degrees C, 33-13 degrees C, 33-23 degrees C, 33-28 degrees C under a 12 h photophase were also tested to estimate virulence of the three isolates against T. evansi. The Vipos isolate discharged more conidia than isolates from Recife or Piracicaba at all temperatures and sporulation was strongly temperature dependent. Optimal sporulation rates were observed at 25 degrees C while optimal germination rates were observed at 25 degrees C and 29 degrees C. At 29 degrees C, the shortest mean survival time of T evansi (3.16 days, 95% Cl of 3.05-3.27) was observed for the isolate from Vipos, while the longest LT50 (3.47 days, 95% CI 3.34-3.59) was observed for the isolate from Piracicaba. Mortality of mites increased as the differences between alternating day and night temperatures increased from 8 degrees C (21-13 degrees C), to 10 degrees C (33-23 degrees C), to 16 degrees C (29-13 degrees C), with smallest and highest temperature differences of 4 degrees C (17-13 degrees C) and 20 degrees C (33-13 degrees C), both producing low mortalities. The overall results suggest that the Vipos isolate is better adapted to a wider range of temperatures than the other isolates tested. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Such environmental variation is traditionally Measured by climatic observation, but recently, measures of environmental phenology obtained from satellite images have been successfully used. We examined the performance of climatic and plant phenology variables in explaining body condition of an invasive omnivore species: the raccoon dog Nyctereutes procyonoides. We collected data on fat deposition of juveniles in southern Finland from the end of June to the beginning of November. A four-parametric logistic model was fitted separately for each province to the data by non-linear regression procedure and the residuals were compared to the expected average as Measure of individual performance. These values were then analysed with respect to the environmental variables. Climatic variables describing spring conditions performed better than plant phenology variables in explaining the variation in fat deposition. Harsh spring conditions negatively affected the amount Of fat deposed during the growing season. Plant phenology variables, effective in explaining life history traits in herbivores, might not reflect variation in food abundance and quality for omnivore species. We propose that in Europe raccoon dogs will benefit from climate warming, because of a longer growing season, but Increased spring precipitation in the form of snow at higher latitudes might compensate for the effect of greater primary productivity and Outline the border of their expansion towards harsher environments.

Cumulative percent hatching was affected significantly by temperature after 290 days of incubation. Hatching was significantly greater at lower temperatures (5, 10 and 15 degrees C) compared with that at the higher temperatures of 20 and 25 degrees C, ranging between 75 and 94% vs 19 and 22%, respectively. The highest cumulative hatch of 94% was obtained at a constant temperature of 15 degrees C at 290 days. However, the lowest cumulative hatch of 33% was obtained after initial exposure to 5 degrees C followed by transfer to 25 degrees C at day 290. In general, incubating the cysts at lower initial temperatures of 10 or 15 degrees C for 58 days gave the highest initial hatching rates 1 week after exposure to the final temperatures. Under natural temperature conditions in the field, J2 emergence started at 17 degrees C in October and continued until the end of April in the temperature range of 2- 17 degrees C. A total hatch of 94% was recorded under field temperature conditions over the course of 1 year. Hatch of most J2 occurred in two peaks; the first in October and the second in February, and, accordingly, the greatest invasion by H. filipjevi is most likely to occur just after these two peaks. Heterodera filipjevi does not seem to have a diapause and could hatch anytime when wheat plants are available.

J	Carrillo, J; Gonzalez-Davila, E				Carrillo, Jose; Gonzalez-Davila, Enrique			Geo-environmental influences on breeding parameters of the Eurasian Kestrel (Falco tinnunculus) in the Western Palaearctic	ORNIS FENNICA												Geographic location largely determines environmental factors such as photoperiod and primary productivity. Breeding effort in birds may reflect different responses to these geographic-related conditions. We studied geographic variation in mean laying date (LD) and mean clutch size (CS) of the Eurasian Kestrel (Falco tinnunculus) in relation to photoperiod, seasonality of resources, temperature and rainfall during the previous winter and breeding season. We assumed that actual evapotranspiration (AE) varies in direct proportion to primary plant production and food resources. Using published data on 23 Western Palaearctic regions (28-65 degrees N) we found that variation in LD was related to photoperiod. Also, Kestrels bred earlier where winter and spring temperatures were higher, spring rainfall was lower and winter AE was higher. The variables that most affected CS were nest type (box/natural), winter AE and spring temperature. CS was directly related to the ratio between spring and winter AE. Moreover, CS was unrelated with spring AE but inversely related to winter A E. The effect of scarce resources (low AE) during the previous winter on CS supports Ashmole's hypothesis (Ashmole 1961). The data available are not sufficient to verify the influence of density of breeding adults on CS.

Population Differentiation and Climatic Adaptation for Growth Potential of White Spruce (Picea glauca) in Alberta, Canada	SILVAE GENETICA												Genetic differentiation among white spruce populations in Alberta, Canada, was studied using time series data of height and diameter and a climatic index developed by principal component analysis. The objectives were to discern patterns of variation for growth potential and predicted optimum climate; compare optimum climate between populations, between height and diameter at the same age and between height or diameter at different ages; and to see if optimum climate differed from the climate inhabited by populations. Using cluster analysis we found that: (1) populations from mid-latitudes (54 degrees - 57 degrees N) and mid-elevations (600 - 800 m) were grouped together and exhibited high growth potential; populations from north of 57 degrees N were grouped with those from elevations higher than 900m in the Rocky Mountains and exhibited low growth potential; and (2) With minor exceptions, populations from similar climates or geography were grouped together in terms of predicted optimum climate. (3) Analysis of variance showed that optimum climate differed significantly (P < 0.05) among populations; among heights at different ages; among diameters at different ages and between height and diameter at the same ages. However, there was no consistent trend in the direction of change in optimum climate with tree age. (4) The range of climate inhabited by the populations (P-I1 = -5.792 to 4.483) was much wider than the range of their predicted optimum climate (<(P)over cap> ((o) over bar1) = -1.001 to 0.842), which suggests that in terms of growth potential some populations inhabit sub-optimal climates. Implications of the results on management of white spruce in Alberta are discussed.																	0037-5349	2509-8934					2010	59	4					158	169		10.1515/sg-2010-0019								WOS:000283900500004

Seasonal adaptations in the life cycles of mites and ticks: comparative and evolutionary aspects	TRENDS IN ACAROLOGY					12th International Congress of Acarology - Trends in Acarology	AUG 21-26, 2006	Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS	Koppert Biol Syst, Nethorlands Genom Inst, Tech Ctr Agr & Rural Cooperat, Indira Publish House, City Council Amsterdam, Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Dynam				Data on seasonal adaptations (in particular on distribution of dormant stages) within the life cycles of the Acari (Chelicerata, Arachnida) are reviewed and compared with similar traits in mandibulate arthropods (insects and crustaceans). They all share responses to photoperiod and temperature, but there are some similarities and essential peculiarities with regard to the ontogenetic distribution of diapausing stages for each of these groups. The main similarity concerns the species-specifity of the dormant stage position, whereas differences concern the number and ontogenetic distribution of these stages within life cycles. Plesiotypic traits of seasonality in the Acari are expressed in the presence of complex 'systems of seasonal control' (SSC) with various dormant stages enabling the control of perennial, semivoltine, and monovoltine development, whereas apotypic traits are characterized by simple SSC with a limited number of dormant stages for control of mono- and polyvoltine development. The Oribatida, a major part of the Prostigmata, and all Ixodida show evolutionary transformations from plesiotypic to apotypic traits of seasonality, but Astigmata, some Prostigmata, and Mesostigmata show fixed apotypic traits only, which pleads for their derived state. Primary adaptations enabling seasonal control of development in arthropods emerged most likely at the earliest steps of the origin of life on earth, and evolved thereafter from the ancestral devices within various taxa of animals according to their organization, manner of life, geographic distribution, and environmental heterogeneity. The evolution of seasonal adaptations in the Acari occurred through transformation of ancestral systems of seasonal control with numerous dormant stages into systems with a reduced number of dormant stages, or even a single dormant stage.																			978-90-481-9836-8				2010							319	326		10.1007/978-90-481-9837-5_51								WOS:000395947900051

The photoperiodic information is translated into a circadian profile of melatonin secretion. After multiple neuronal relays (within the hypothalamus), melatonin affects gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion, which in turn controls ovarian cyclicity. The pattern of GnRH secretion is mirrored by that of luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion, whose plasmatic level can be easily measured. We addressed the question of whether there exists an endogenous circannual rhythm in a tropical sheep (Blackbelly) population that exhibits clear seasonal ovarian activity when ewes are subject to temperate latitudes. We based our analysis on LH time series collected in the course of 3 years from ewes subject to a constant photoperiodic regime. Owing to intra-and interanimal variability and unequal sampling times, the existence of an endogenous rhythm is not straightforward. We have used time-frequency signal processing methods, and especially the smooth pseudo-Wigner-Ville distribution, to extract possible hidden rhythms from the data. To further investigate the low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) components of the signals, we have designed a simple mathematical model of the LH plasmatic level accounting for the effect of experimental sampling times. The model enables us to (i) confirm the existence of an endogenous circannual rhythm as detected by the LF signal component, (ii) investigate the action mechanism of the photoperiod on the pulsatile pattern of LH secretion (control of the interpulse interval), and (iii) conclude that the HF component is mainly due to the experimental sampling protocol.																	1364-503X					DEC 13	2009	367	1908					4759	4777		10.1098/rsta.2009.0136								WOS:000271332700007	19884179

Effects of the Nordic Photoperiod on Ozone Sensitivity and Repair in Different Clover Species Studied Using Infrared Imaging	AMBIO												Plants in Nordic regions can be more ozone sensitive at a given ozone concentration than plants at lower latitudes. A recent study shows that the Nordic summer photoperiod, particularly the dim nighttime light, can increase visible foliar injury and alter leaf transpiration in subterranean clover. Effects of photoperiod on the ozone sensitivity of white and red clover cultivars adapted to Nordic conditions were investigated. Although ozone induced visible foliar injury and leaf transpirational changes in white clover, the effects were independent of photoperiod. In red clover, ozone combined with a long photoperiod with dim nights (8 nights) induced more severe visible injuries than with a short photoperiod. Furthermore, transpirational changes in red clover depended on photoperiod. Thus, a long photoperiod can increase ozone sensitivity differently in clover cultivars with different degrees of adaptation to northern conditions, suggesting that ozone indices used in risk analysis should take this effect into account.																	0044-7447					DEC	2009	38	8					437	442		10.1579/0044-7447-38.8.437								WOS:000274014600007	20175443

Delayed emergence and the success of parasitoids in biological control	BIOLOGICAL CONTROL												Delayed emergence, a life history feature of many insects living in unpredictable environments, can have major consequences for the dynamics of host-parasitoid interactions, which vary according to their physiological interactions. We studied, through simple modeling, the significance of prolonged diapause on the suppression levels achieved by parasitoids and illustrate our case with a system involving a major forest pest, the woodwasp Sirex noctilio and two of its parasitoid species that have been introduced into different geographical regions through classical biological control programmes. Our findings suggest that the physiological relationship between parasitoid and host delayed emergence patterns may help understand observed variable success in several bio-control programs. We conclude that for given environments, host delayed emergence and the way in which parasitoids deal with it, should be included in the list of selection criteria of natural enemies of many pests, especially those affecting forests.

The effects of such a light regime on the performance of insect pests on roses have so far not been investigated. In the present study, survival, developmental time, and reproduction during one generation of the greenhouse whitefly, Trialeurodes vaporariorum Westwood (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae), were characterized on roses, Rosaxhybrida cv. Passion, grown in climate chambers with long-day conditions (L20:D4) or continuous light (L24:D0) at 21 degrees C and fluctuating relative humidity (mean 74%, range 47-96%). Whiteflies reared under continuous light had lower immature survival and fecundity and shorter female longevity than whiteflies reared under long-day conditions, but immature developmental time was only slightly affected. Life-table analysis showed that the net reproductive rate (R(o)) and intrinsic rate of natural increase (r(m)) were reduced by 85 and 76%, respectively, and the time for the population to double its size (D) was 4.2 times longer under continuous light. This mean that the whitefly population growth under continuous light was strongly reduced compared with the traditional light regime used in rose production.																	0013-8703					DEC	2009	133	3					244	250		10.1111/j.1570-7458.2009.00927.x								WOS:000271779300004

Life-history traits of the edible stinkbug, Encosternum delegorguei (Hem., Tessaratomidae), a traditional food in southern Africa	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY												Little is known of the life history of the edible stinkbug, Encosternum delegorguei, although it is an important food for people living in north-eastern South Africa and southern Zimbabwe. The present study aimed to establish key elements influencing long-term sustainable harvesting. Outdoor insectaries of two sizes were constructed to observe: daily activity, utilization of plants, copulation, oviposition, eclosion and survival from May 2006 to February 2007. The rest of the annual life cycle was observed in the field in March and April 2007 and identified as univoltine. In autumn (May) E. delegorguei entered reproductive diapause and aggregated within the escarpment mist-belt where it survived the winter on vapour condensation without feeding. Monthly dissections showed that abdominal fat content was highest in June. In spring (September) E. delegorguei fed on sap of the trees Combretum imberbe, Combretum molle, Peltophorum africanum, to a lesser degree on Dodonaea viscosa and the grass Pennisetum clandestinum. Copulation occurred in October and November. An overall total of 1752 E. delegorguei eggs were laid by 103 females and incubation time averaged 18.7 +/- 9.0 days (range 7-37) at outdoor temperature ranging from 11 degrees C to 25 degrees C. The mean number of eggs in 64 egg masses was 27.4 +/- 13.9 (range of 2-56 eggs). Shade cloth (68.8%) was the most commonly used substrate for depositing eggs followed by P. clandestinum (12.5%), C. imberbe (7.8%), P. africanum (6.3%), D. viscosa (1.6%), C. molle (1.6%) and C. erythrophyllum (1.6%). The parasitoid wasp, Anastatus sp. (Hymenoptera: Eupelmidae) infected 57% of the eggs deposited by captive females. Availability of food plants in combination with parasitoid threat may be a reason for seasonal migration between overwintering sites within the mist-belt and summer oviposition sites. Diminishing harvests could be attributed to fuelwood harvesting of food plants in the summer sites.

A critical assessment of two species distribution models: a case study of the vervet monkey (Cercopithecus aethiops)	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim Species distribution models are invaluable tools in biogeographical, ecological and applied biological research, but specific concerns have been raised in relation to different modelling techniques in terms of their validity. Here we compare two fundamentally different approaches to species distribution modelling, one based on simple occurrence data where the lack of an ecological framework has been criticized, and the other firmly based in socio-ecological theory but requiring highly detailed behavioural information that is often limited in availability. Location (Sub-Saharan) Africa. Methods We used two distinct techniques to predict the realized distribution of a model species, the vervet monkey (Cercopithecus aethiops Linnaeus, 1758). A maximum entropy model was produced taking 13 environmental variables and presence-only data from 174 sites throughout Africa as input, with an additional 58 sites retained to test the model. A time-budget model considering the same environmental variables was constructed from detailed behavioural data on 20 groups representing 14 populations, with presence-only data from the remaining 218 sites reserved to test model predictions on vervet monkey occurrence. Both models were further validated against a reference species distribution map as drawn up by the African Mammals Databank. Results Both models performed well, with the time budget and maximum entropy algorithms correctly predicting vervet monkey presence at 78.4% and 91.4% of their respective test sites. Similarly, the time-budget model correctly predicted presence and absence at 87.4% of map pixels against the reference distribution map, and the maximum entropy model achieved a success rate of 81.8%. Finally, there was a high level of agreement (81.6%) between the presence-absence maps produced by the two models, and the environmental variables identified as most strongly driving vervet monkey distribution were the same in both models. Main conclusions The time-budget and maximum entropy models produced accurate and remarkably similar species distribution maps, despite fundamental differences in their conceptual and methodological approaches. Such strong convergence not only provides support for the credibility of current results, but also relieves concerns about the validity of the two modelling approaches.

Clinal variation in post-winter male fertility retention; an adaptive overwintering strategy in Drosophila melanogaster	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY												In insects including Drosophila melanogaster, females can overwinter at the adult stage by adopting a shallow reproductive diapause, but almost nothing is known about male reproductive diapause. In this study, we test for the maintenance of fertility in overwintering males from the eastern Australian D. melanogaster cline. Males from southern temperate populations maintained in field cages in temperate Melbourne had a higher fertility in spring compared with males from tropical locations. Temperate males successfully inseminated more females, and there were also more offspring produced per inseminated female. The resulting linear post-winter fertility clines were unrelated to male body size. In contrast, there was no clinal variation for fertility in nonoverwintering males held in the laboratory. The cline in overwintering male fertility is likely to have evolved as an adaptive response to latitudinal climatic variation over the last 100 years.

Crantz) fruits and seeds from different altitudes	PERIODICUM BIOLOGORUM												Aims and objectives of research: The study aimed to research the influence of altitude on dimensions, i.e. the shape of Wild Service tree fruits (Sorbus torminalis (L.) Crantz). We also wanted to test the variability of major biological characteristics of fruits and seed, the elements of seed quality and their relations. Materials and Methods: In September 2003 we gathered fruits from 24 Wild Service Trees of different ages and positions in the stand structure Oil three sites (Medvednica, Psunj and Juzni Dilj) situated at different altitudes. The altitude of each tree was determined with the GPSmap 60CSx device, after which dendrometric measurements were carried out and fruits were collected. We measured fruit length (FL) and width (FW) and calculated their index (FL/FW). The mass of each fruit was weighted on the laboratory scales Sartorius and the number of fruits per kilo was calculated. The seeds were manually extracted from the fruits and the number of filled (sound) seeds per fruit was counted in line with the ISTA rules. In order to bread the double seed dormancy We applied the stratification ill accordance with the ISTA rules. For the statistical analyst's of the data we used ANOVA, LSD test, correlation analysis tend canonical discriminant multivariate analysis with locality as a grouping variable. All statistical analyses were performed using STATISTICA 8.0 program package. Results: We obtained a positive and strong correlation between fruit length (end altitude (R=0.67), i.e. between fruit shape index and altitude (R=0.71), which means that the higher the altitude of the population of the Wild Service Tree in the Republic of Croatia, the longer the fruits. At higher altitudes the Wild Service Tree seed shows a larger degree of dormancy and requires somewhat longer period of stratification. Conclusion: The observed differences between the three studied locations might be attributed to changed climatic and soil conditions.

J	David, S				David, S. Saunders			Circadian rhythms and the evolution of photoperiodic timing in insects	PHYSIOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												This review discusses possible evolutionary trends in insect photoperiodism, mainly from a chronobiological perspective. A crucial step was the forging of a link between the hormones regulating diapause and the systems of biological rhythms, circadian or circannual, which have independently evolved in eukaryotes to synchronize physiology and behaviour to the daily cycles of light and darkness. In many of these responses a central feature is that the circadian system resets to a constant phase at the beginning of the subjective night, and then 'measures' the duration of the next scotophase. In 'external coincidence', one version of such a clock, light now has a dual role. First, it serves to entrain the circadian system to the stream of pulses making up the light/dark cycle and, second, it regulates the nondiapause/diapause switch in development by illuminating/not illuminating a specific light sensitive phase falling at the end of the critical night length. Important work by A. D. Lees on the aphid Megoura viciae using so-called 'night interruption experiments' demonstrates that pulses falling early in the night lead to long-day effects that are reversible by a subsequent dark period longer than the critical night length and also show maximal sensitivity in the blue-green range of the spectrum. Pulses falling in the latter half of the night, however, produce long-day effects that are irreversible by a subsequent long-night and show a spectral sensitivity extending into the red. With movement to higher latitudes, insects develop genetic clines in various parameters, including critical night length, the number of long-night cycles needed for diapause induction, the strength of the response, and the 'depth' or intensity of the diapause thus induced. Evidence for these and other types of photoperiodic response suggests that they provided strong selective advantages for insect survival.																	0307-6962					DEC	2009	34	4					301	308		10.1111/j.1365-3032.2009.00699.x								WOS:000271975600001

In the present study, the effective length of light pulse in night interruption experiments is determined at 25 degrees C. Various lengths of light pulse are tested by inserting them at the midnight of an LD 12 : 12 h photoperiod. When the light pulse is 15 or 30 min, the incidence of diapause is 86%. To inhibit the induction of diapause effectively, a light pulse of 1.75-2 h is needed. The incidence of diapause is 12% under an LD 12 : 5 : 2 : 5 h photoperiod. To determine the precise role of the light pulse, 2-h light pulses placed at the midnight of an LD 12 : 12 h photoperiod are disrupted systematically by darkness. When a 2-h light pulse is disrupted by 15 min of darkness, diapause is generally prevented (< 29%) regardless of the temporal position of darkness. Longer disruption by darkness induces diapause moderately (37-67%). A Bunsow experiment is also conducted at 25 and 20 degrees C, in which the main photophase of 12 h of light is combined with 24-72-h scotophases scanned by a 2-h light pulse. The photoperiodic cycle length tested, therefore, varies in the range 36-84 h. In each cycle length, the incidence of diapause fluctuates as the light pulse moves toward dawn. However, no regular and circadian changes in the percentage diapause are observed in relation to diapause determination.																	0307-6962	1365-3032				DEC	2009	34	4					333	337		10.1111/j.1365-3032.2009.00695.x								WOS:000271975600005						
J	Schoech, SJ				Schoech, Stephan J.			Food supplementation experiments: A tool to reveal mechanisms that mediate timing of reproduction	INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY					Annual Meeting of the Society-for-Integrative-and-Comparative-Biology	JAN 03-07, 2011	Salt Lake City, UT	Soc Integrat & Comparat Biol				Food supplementation of free-living animals has been used to address the role of availability of resources in the timing of reproduction. A meta-analysis by Schoech and Hahn suggested that responsiveness of the reproductive axis to the supplementary cue of food is lessened at higher latitudes, presumably because the brief time during which conditions are appropriate to rear offspring has led to an evolved resistance to supplementary cues with a primary reliance on photoperiod. Unfortunately, few investigators have examined the potential underlying mechanisms that mediate this differential responsiveness to supplemental food across latitudes. Considerable research, however, links nutritional state and plasma glucocorticoid levels, both of which impinge upon the reproductive axis. Long-term research, on Florida scrub-jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens) in my laboratory shows that suburban birds with access to ad libitum supplemental food express early breeding and lower plasma corticosterone (CORT) levels in comparison to jays in nearby natural habitat. Furthermore, supplementation in natural habitat advances laying, with the largest effects occurring in bad years (i.e., years defined by late breeding and poor reproductive output by non-supplemented controls). Similarly, reproductive output of supplemented jays is greater and exhibits considerably less variance than do controls, suggesting fitness benefits of supplementation that are tied to advanced breeding. Generally, CORT levels in early-breeding supplemented jays are lower than are those of controls. Also, regression analysis suggests that clutch-initiation dates of non-supplemented female breeders are predicted by baseline CORT levels. Although these data are not conclusive and trends can be obscured by year-effects, they suggest a role for CORT in timing of breeding. Whether this link might help to explain the above-referenced latitudinal trends remains to be characterized.																	1540-7063					NOV	2009	49	5					480	492		10.1093/icb/icp005								WOS:000271946500002	21665835

Protandry, the earlier arrival of males relative to females at the site of reproduction, is a widespread phenomenon found in many migratory organisms. Detailed knowledge of the determinants of protandry is becoming increasingly important for predicting how migratory species and populations will respond to rapid phenological shifts caused by climatic change. Here, we review and discuss the potential mechanisms underlying protandrous migration in birds, focusing oil evidence from passerine species. Latitudinal segregation during the non-breeding period and differences in the initiation of spring migration are probably the key determinants of protandrous arrival at the breeding sites, while sexual differences in speed of migration appear to play a minor role. Experimental evidence suggests that differences between the sexes in the onset of spring migratory activity are caused by differences in circannual rhythmicity or by photoperiodic responsiveness. Both of these mechanisms are hardwired and could prevent individuals from responding plastically to chronic changes in temperature at the breeding grounds. As a consequence, adaptive changes in both the timing of arrival in spring and of reproduction will require evolutionary (genetic) changes of the cue-response systems underlying the initiation and extent of migration in both males and females.

J	Helm, B				Helm, Barbara			Geographically distinct reproductive schedules in a changing world: Costly implications in captive Stonechats	INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY					Annual Meeting of the Society-for-Integrative-and-Comparative-Biology	JAN 03-07, 2011	Salt Lake City, UT	Soc Integrat & Comparat Biol (SICB)				With progressively faster global change, shifts in phenology, and distributional ranges are reported for all increasing number of species. The success of organisms at coping with novel seasonal conditions depends on the mechanisms that determine their schedules. Species that rely on fixed schedules and those that time their activities by predictive cues may be particularly constrained in their ability to accommodate changes. The present study examines rigid scheduling and its implications for breeding in captivity in an avian model taxon, the Stonechat (Saxicola torquata). Within their extensive breeding range, Stonechats differ geographically in migratory behavior and reproduce and molt under a wide range of daylengths (10-17h). Stonechats time their activities by programs that involve circannal rhythms and photoperiodism. The Study reports reproductive timing of four taxa (central European, Irish, Siberian, and Kenyan), relates it to laydates in the field, and investigates modifying influences of housing conditions and of social context. Reproductive consequences of timing programs were then tested by crossbreeding of taxa with different schedules. The study revealed persistent, population-specific breeding windows in captivity. Resident Stonechats from equatorial Kenya synchronized their reproductive cycles with the European summer, presumably in response to local photoperiod, and bred at similar times as northern migrants. In all other taxa schedules matched those in the field, but were timed slightly earlier in captivity and advanced by indoor keeping conditions. Influences of social context were negligible. In pairs with Clutches, testes regressed slightly later than in pairs without clutches, but presence of a mate per se had no influence on breeding cycles. Accordingly, crossbreeding Stonechats were predicted to have limited capacity to adjust schedules to those of their mates. This prediction was tested by crossbreeding of single-clutched Siberian long-distance migrants with multiple-clutched European short-distance migrants. Males and females of both taxa retained their characteristic breeding schedules, regardless of their mate's activities. This led to dramatic loss of reproductive success ill the Population with the longer breeding season, European Stonechats. Siberian Stonechats were unable to profit from the presence of a sexually active mate, but they suffered no disadvantage from crossbreeding. In a changing world, inherited timing programs may severely constrain responses to novel conditions, impose schedule-dependent, asymmetric costs of hybridization, and contribute to directional gene flow or to reproductive isolation.																	1540-7063	1557-7023				NOV	2009	49	5					563	579		10.1093/icb/icp037								WOS:000271946500008	21665841

Population Genomics of the Arabidopsis thaliana Flowering Time Gene Network	MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												The time to flowering is a key component of the life-history strategy of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana that varies quantitatively among genotypes. A significant problem for evolutionary and ecological genetics is to understand how natural selection may operate on this ecologically significant trait. Here, we conduct a Population genomic Study Of resequencing data from 52 genes in the flowering time network. McDonald-Kreitman tests of neutrality suggested a strong excess of amino acid polymorphism when pooling across loci. This excess of replacement polymorphism across the flowering time network and a skewed derived frequency spectrum toward rare alleles for both replacement and noncoding polymorphisms relative to synonymous changes is consistent with a large class of deleterious polymorphisms segregating in these genes. Assuming selective neutrality of synonymous changes, we estimate that approximately 30% of amino acid polymorphisms are deleterious. Evidence of adaptive Substitution is less prominent ill Our analysis. The photoperiod regulatory gene, CO, and a gibberellic acid transcription factor, AtMYB33, show evidence of adaptive fixation of amino acid mutations. A test for extended haplotypes revealed no examples of flowering time alleles with haplotypes comparable ill length to those associated with the null fri(col) allele reported previously. This suggests that the FRI gene likely has it uniquely intense or recent history of selection among the flowering time genes considered here. Although there is some evidence for adaptive evolution in these life-history genes, it appears that slightly deleterious polymorphisms are a major component Of natural Molecular variation in the flowering time network of A. thaliana.																	0737-4038					NOV	2009	26	11					2475	2486		10.1093/molbev/msp161								WOS:000271422300007	19625391

Todothyas Cook, 1974, not Acerbitas Ozdikmen, 2006, must replace the preoccupied genus name Thyas Koch, 1836; Acerbitas is ranked as a subgenus of Todothyas. The following synonyms are established: Family Hydryphantidae: Todothyas distincta (Tuzovskij, 2007) = Todothyas colligera (K. Viets, 1923); Todothyas incerta (Lundblad, 1941) = Todothyas barbigera (K. Viets, 1908); Georgella intermedia Walter, 1927 (G. dauphinensis nom. nov. K. O.

Redescriptions are given for numerous further species, redefining diagnostic characters and geographical distributions. Todothyas colligera (K. Viets, 1923) and Wandesia propinqua Walter, 1947 are redefined and newly established as separate species. Parathyas primitiva Lundblad, 1935 is transferred to the genus Todothyas Cook, 1974. Sperchon vaginosus Thor, 1902 is re-established as a distinct species in the 'denticulatus-group'. Torrenticola laskai Di Sabatino spec. nov. is introduced as a new name for Mediterranean populations attributed by several authors to T. lativalvata K. Viets, 1952. Torrenticola amplexa minutivalvata Lundblad, 1956 is elevated to species rank. First records from Spain are given for Torrenticola limula Gerecke & Di Sabatino, 1996, a species previously known only from Sardinia and Corsica. Diagnostic differences between the three European species of the serratipalpis-groups are discussed.

In insects, fitness is generally maximized by producing as many generations as possible within a season, and in many species, the number of generations produced (voltinism) increases with increasing season length. In this study, we analyzed variation in adult life histories in insects along a climatic gradient. The analyzed trait is reproductive effort (resource allocation to reproduction). We begin by formalizing the trade-off between current reproduction and subsequent survival generated by reproductive effort. It appeared that reproductive effort is correlated positively with early fecundity and negatively with lifetime fecundity and life span. Then, deriving from that trade-off, we analyze the evolutionary stability of different schedules of age-specific fecundity that are generated by divergent reproductive effort. The analysis was carried out in season lengths that promote either univoltine or bivoltine phenology. The evolutionarily stable reproductive effort decreases with increasing season length in both phenologies, with a sudden increase when a change from univoltine to partially bivoltine phenology takes place. Reproductive effort responds strongly to changing phenology when density-dependent mortality occurs during diapause and weakly when juvenile mortality is density dependent.

J	Zhu, DH; Yang, YP; Liu, ZW				Zhu, Dao-Hong; Yang, Yan-Ping; Liu, Zhiwei			Reversible change in embryonic diapause intensity by mild temperature in the Chinese rice grasshopper, Oxya chinensis	ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA												The effects of temperature on maintenance and termination of embryonic diapause were investigated in Jining (35.4 degrees N, 116.6 degrees E) and Sihong (33.5 degrees N, 118.2 degrees E) strains of the Chinese rice grasshopper, Oxya chinensis Thunberg (Orthoptera: Catantopidae). Eggs of both strains entered diapause when incubated at 30, 25, or 20 degrees C. Chilling at 8 degrees C had an evident effect on diapause termination and almost all eggs chilled for 60 days ended diapause development. Chilling of eggs at 8 degrees C for only 20 days failed to result in any hatching at 20 degrees C, suggesting that such level of chilling was not enough to induce diapause termination. However, the treatment combining incubation of eggs at 30 degrees C for varying lengths of time with subsequent incubation to 20 degrees C had a distinct effect on the completion of diapause of the eggs. The results indicate that there were two temperature optima, that is, low temperature (chilling) and high temperature, for diapause development in this grasshopper species. Incubation of chilled eggs at 20 degrees C for 5-15 days followed by further incubation at 25 degrees C reduced termination of diapause significantly compared with the eggs only chilled at 8 degrees C. Exposure of eggs chilled at 8 degrees C to a pulse of 25 degrees C from 1 to 7 days, separated by a 20-day interval at 8 degrees C, resulted in a decrease in the percentage of successfully hatched eggs as the length of the pulse of 25 degrees C increased. The results suggest that diapause intensity may be restored at moderately high temperatures. This reversible change in diapause intensity would play an important role in maintaining diapause before winter.																	0013-8703	1570-7458				OCT	2009	133	1					1	8		10.1111/j.1570-7458.2009.00901.x								WOS:000269701100001

Influences of Temperature on Homalodisca vitripennis (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) Survival Under Various Feeding Conditions	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												Survival of the glassy-winged sharpshooter, Homalodisca vitripennis (Germar) (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae), was studied under various constant temperatures and feeding conditions. When provided a host plant (Citrus limon L. Burm. f.) to feed on during a 21-d trial, 100% mortality occurred at 0.1, 3.2, and 40.1 degrees C, whereas an average of 74-76% of adults survived in the 13.2-24.5 degrees C range. When individually confined with moist cotton, adult longevity was greatest (16.3 d) at 13.3 degrees C, but it was < 3 d at -2.4 and 36.2 degrees C. In a companion study comparing the presence versus absence of a host plant, the presence of a host plant was not a significant factor influencing survival at temperatures <= 7.8 degrees C but was at temperatures >= 18.9 degrees C. The relationship between temperature and survival was described by a nonlinear function that estimated the optimum temperature in each feeding regimen: no host plant or moist cotton (5.5 degrees C), moist cotton (9.9 degrees C), and accessible host plant (25.1 degrees C). The model quantitatively predicted that H. vitripennis would survive longer periods at a wider temperature regimen when provided with a host plant than when provided with water alone (moist cotton) or when provided with neither plant host nor water. Our results suggest that continuous exposure to either low (< 5 degrees C) or high (> 30 degrees C) temperatures are detrimental for adult survival. Specifically, low temperatures caused early mortality because of inhibition of feeding activity and presumably this threshold lies between 7.8 and 13.2 degrees C. Furthermore, this study clearly shows that temperature may influence the survival of H. vitripennis adults regardless of feeding regimens, and its implications for population dynamics are discussed.																	0046-225X	1938-2936				OCT	2009	38	5					1485	1495		10.1603/022.038.0517								WOS:000270610000017	19825304

Climate change and bet-hedging: interactions between increased soil temperatures and seed bank persistence	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												In order to predict the long-term consequences of climate change, it is necessary to link future environmental changes to mechanisms that control plant population processes. This information can then be incorporated into strategies to more accurately model climate change impacts on species or to estimate future extinction risks. We examined the impact of increased temperatures on the longevity and dynamics of the persistent soil seed banks of eight ephemeral species from arid Australia. We found that the predicted global temperature increases under climate change will be reflected in increased soil temperatures, and that seeds in the soil seed bank will be exposed to long durations of high temperatures over the summer months. Three of the eight species studied had significantly greater levels of germination after exposure to predicted increased soil temperatures. Another species displayed a dramatic decrease in seed viability after such exposure. The capacity of such species to use the seed bank to bet hedge against rainfall events that cause germination but are insufficient to allow plant maturation, is compromised by increased germinability and subsequent loss or reduction of seed bank persistence. These predicted changes in the dynamics of soil seed banks increase the risk of local extinctions of these species, while the composition of the community may be altered by changes in species abundance. Our results show that the risk spreading mechanism provided by persistent seed banks could be compromised by the mechanistic impact of forecast temperature increases in arid habitats, and highlight the need to understand mechanisms that control population dynamics when attempting to address likely future impacts of climate change on biodiversity.

J	Guo, K; Hao, SG; Sun, OJ; Kang, L				Guo, Kun; Hao, Shu-Guang; Sun, Osbert Jianxin; Kang, Le			Differential responses to warming and increased precipitation among three contrasting grasshopper species	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												We conducted a field manipulation experiment to investigate developmental and demographic responses to warming and increased precipitation in three Inner Mongolian grasshopper species that differ in phenology (an early-season species Dasyhippus barbipes, a mid-season species Oedaleus asiaticus, and a late-season species Chorthippus fallax). Infrared heaters were used for warming the ground surface by 1-2 degrees C above the ambient condition and periodic irrigations were applied to simulate a 50% increase in annual precipitation. We found that warming advanced the timing for egg hatching and grasshopper eclosion in each of the three species. However, grasshopper diapause and increased precipitation appeared to offset the effect of warming on egg development. Hatching and development were more strongly affected by warming in the mid-season O. asiaticus and the late-season C. fallax relative to the early-season D. barbipes. Warming by similar to 1.5 degrees C advanced the occurrence of the mid-season O. asiaticus by an average of 4.96 days; while warming and increased precipitation interactively affected the occurrence of the late-season C. fallax, which advanced by 5.53 days. Our data and those of others suggest that most grasshopper species in the Inner Mongolian grassland are likely to extend their distribution northward with climate change. However, because of the differential response to warming we demonstrate for these species, the different grasshopper species are predicted to aggregate toward the middle period of the growing season, potentially increasing interspecific competition and grazing pressure on grasslands.

Costs of pair-bonding and paternal care in male prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster)	PHYSIOLOGY & BEHAVIOR												The direct costs of paternal care are relatively well documented in primates, however little research has explored these effects in monogamous rodents. The present study examines the long-term effects that pairing and parenting have on male prairie voles. We hypothesized that there would be a significant weight loss over the course of pairing and parenting, presumably from the energetic demands that accompany these changes in social condition. In a longitudinal study, we followed ten male prairie voles through being housed with their brother; paired with a female; and caring for three consecutive litters. We found a significant drop in bodyweight across time, with maximum weight loss near the weaning of the first litter. At that same time, feeding increased, leading to possible recovery in weight; however, leptin levels dropped precipitously across time and did not recover. Corticosterone did not change significantly across time points, and overall activity levels also did not vary significantly over the course of the study. In addition, newly paired males showed a significant increase in preference for a 2% sucrose solution during a three-hour test, indicating a metabolic need for more calories. A cross-sectional study confirmed leptin and corticosterone findings, and showed significant loss of subcutaneous (inguinal) fat in males that had cared for a litter of pups, when compared to males housed with their brothers or newly paired males. These results suggest that cohabitation with a female, and caring for pups, all have costs for male prairie voles. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Seasonal habitat selection by lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) in a small Canadian shield lake: constraints imposed by winter conditions	AQUATIC ECOLOGY					1st International Winter Limnology Symposium	MAY 24-28, 2008	Kilpisjarvi Biol Stn, Kilpisjarvi, FINLAND	Univ Jyvaskyla, Univ Joensuu, Univ Helsinki	Kilpisjarvi Biol Stn			The need for cold, well-oxygenated waters significantly reduces the habitat available for lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) during stratification of small temperate lakes. We examined the spatial and pelagic distribution of lake trout over two consecutive summers and winters and tested whether winter increased habitat availability and access to littoral regions in a boreal shield lake in which pelagic prey fish are absent. In winter, lake trout had a narrowly defined pelagic distribution that was skewed to the upper 3 m of the water column and spatially situated in the central region of the lake. Individual core areas of use (50% Kernel utilization distributions) in winter were much reduced (75%) and spatially non-overlapping compared to summer areas, but activity levels were similar between seasons. Winter habitat selection is in contrast to observations from the stratified season, when lake trout were consistently located in much deeper waters (> 6 m) and widely distributed throughout the lake. Winter distribution of lake trout appeared to be strongly influenced by ambient light levels; snow depth and day length accounted for up to 69% of the variation in daily median fish depth. More restricted habitat use during winter than summer was in contrast to our original prediction and illustrates that a different suite of factors influence lake trout distribution between these seasons.																	1386-2588	1573-5125				SEP	2009	43	3					777	787		10.1007/s10452-009-9266-3								WOS:000269837500018						
J	Hu, XW; Wu, YP; Wang, YR				Hu, Xiao Wen; Wu, Yan Pei; Wang, Yan Rong			Different requirements for physical dormancy release in two populations of Sophora alopecuroides relation to burial depth	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH												Most species of Fabaceae produce seeds with physical dormancy which was broken by some environmental factors in the field, yet for the mechanism of physical dormancy release in the natural condition is still poorly understood. In present study, seeds of Sophora alopecuroides from two populations were placed on the soil surface or buried at depths of 2 and 7 cm in the field and were exhumed at time intervals to assess the changes of dormancy. Also, microenvironments were simulated in the laboratory to determine the possible components (temperature, temperature fluctuation, and moisture) involved in physical dormancy release. The laboratory work indicated that wet heat is an important dormancy release mechanism for both populations; and dry heat for one of them, but showed no effects on the other one. Consistent with that, burial experiment showed seeds of two populations had two contrasting-dormancy release patterns in the field. Most seeds of the dry heat sensitive population released dormancy but the other one remained dormant when seeds placed on the soil surface for 11 months (where seeds were exposed to dry heat but not wet heat). The difference of physical dormancy release pattern response to burial depth and simulated condition may attribute to seed coat color and hilum thickness which showed significantly different between two populations. This conclusion may improve understanding of physical dormancy release mechanism among populations and have a practical use for grassland management and weed control.																	0912-3814					SEP	2009	24	5					1051	1056		10.1007/s11284-008-0580-3								WOS:000270837200013

Tropical niche conservatism and the species richness gradient of North American butterflies	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim We explore the potential role of the 'tropical conservatism hypothesis' in explaining the butterfly species richness gradient in North America. Its applicability can be derived from the tropical origin of butterflies and the presumed difficulties in evolving the cold tolerance required to permit the colonization and permanent occupation of the temperate zone. Location North America. Methods Digitized range maps for butterfly species north of Mexico were used to map richness for all species, species with distributions north of the Tropic of Capricorn (Extratropicals), and species that also occupy the tropics (Tropicals). A phylogeny resolved to subfamily was used to map the geographical pattern of mean root distance, a metric of the evolutionary development of assemblages. Regression models and general linear models examined environmental correlates of overall richness and for Extratropicals vs. Tropicals, patterns in summer vs. winter, and patterns in northern vs. southern North America. Results Species in more basal subfamilies dominate the south, whereas more derived clades occupy the north. There is also a 'latitudinal' richness gradient in Canada/Alaska, whereas in the conterminous USA richness primarily varies longitudinally. Overall richness is associated with broad- and mesoscale temperature gradients. The richness of Tropicals is strongly associated with temperature and distance from winter population sources. The richness of Extratropicals in the north is most strongly correlated with the pattern of glacial retreat since the more recent Ice Age, whereas in the south, richness is positively associated with the range of temperatures in mountains and the presence of forests but is negatively correlated with the broad-scale temperature gradient. Main conclusions The tropical conservatism hypothesis provides a possible explanation for the complex structure of the species richness gradient. The Canada/Alaska fauna comprises temperate, boreal and tundra species that are nevertheless constrained by cold climates and limited vegetation, coupled with possible post-Pleistocene recolonization lags. In the USA tropical species are constrained by temperature in winter as well as recolonization distances in summer, whereas temperate-zone groups are richer in cooler climates in mountains and forests, where winter conditions are more suitable for diapause. The evolution of cold tolerance is key to both the evolutionary and ecological patterns.

Environmental control of ovarian dormancy in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY A-NEUROETHOLOGY SENSORY NEURAL AND BEHAVIORAL PHYSIOLOGY												Drosophila melanogaster from Australia, Europe and North America enter an adult ovarian dormancy in response to short days and low temperatures. The independent effects of temperature and day length in the determination of dormancy have been examined only in one long-established laboratory line (Canton-S). In all other studies of natural or laboratory populations, dormancy has been assessed at either a single short day or a single moderately low temperature. Herein, we determine the relative roles of temperature, photoperiod, and their interaction in the control of ovarian dormancy in D. melanogaster from two natural populations representing latitudinal extremes in eastern North America (Florida at 27A degrees N and Maine at 44A degrees N). In both natural populations, temperature is the main determinant of dormancy, alone explaining 67% of the total variation among replicate isofemale lines, whereas photoperiod has no significant effect. We conclude that ovarian dormancy in D. melanogaster is a temperature-initiated syndrome of winter-tolerant traits that represents an adaptive phenotypic plasticity in temperate seasonal environments.

Indirect effects of FRIGIDA: floral trait (co)variances are altered by seasonally variable abiotic factors associated with flowering time	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY												Reproductive timing is a critical life-history event that could influence the (co)variation of traits developing later in ontogeny by regulating exposure to seasonally variable factors. In a field experiment with Arabidopsis thaliana, we explore whether allelic variation at a flowering-time gene of major effect (FRIGIDA) affects (co)variation of floral traits by regulating exposure to photoperiod, temperature, and moisture levels. We detect a positive latitudinal cline in floral organ size among plants with putatively functional FRI alleles. Statistically controlling for bolting day removes the cline, suggesting that seasonal abiotic variation affects floral morphology. Both photoperiod and precipitation at bolting correlate positively with the length of petals, stamens, and pistils. Additionally, floral (co)variances differ significantly across FRI backgrounds, such that the sign of some floral-trait correlations reverses. Subsequent experimental manipulations of photoperiod and water availability demonstrate direct effects of these abiotic factors on floral traits. In sum, these results highlight how the timing of life-history events can affect the expression of traits developing later in ontogeny, and provide some of the first empirical evidence for the effects of major genes on evolutionary potential.

Habitat temperature was approximately 12 degrees C at both sampling times. For May scallops, performance was better at 6 than at 12 or 18 degrees C whereas September scallops performed better at 6 and 12 degrees C than at 19 degrees C. Regardless of environmental history, the rate of phasic contractions consistently declined at 18-19 degrees C, due to a decrease in the number of phasic contractions. Force measurements during escape responses of May scallops showed that phasic force production and the minimal interval between contractions changed little with temperature, whereas the minimum and mean durations of phasic contractions decreased as temperature rose. Phasic contraction rate in the first series increased with temperature. Reliance upon tonic contractions was higher in scallops tested at 18 degrees C than in those tested at 6 degrees C.

J	Bruyndonckx, N; Henry, I; Christe, P; Kerth, G				Bruyndonckx, Nadia; Henry, Isabelle; Christe, Philippe; Kerth, Gerald			Spatio-temporal population genetic structure of the parasitic mite Spinturnix bechsteini is shaped by its own demography and the social system of its bat host	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Information about the population genetic structures of parasites is important for an understanding of parasite transmission pathways and ultimately the co-evolution with their hosts. If parasites cannot disperse independently of their hosts, a parasite's population structure will depend upon the host's spatial distribution. Geographical barriers affecting host dispersal can therefore lead to structured parasite populations. However, how the host's social system affects the genetic structure of parasite populations is largely unknown. We used mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to describe the spatio-temporal population structure of a contact-transmitted parasitic wing mite (Spinturnix bechsteini) and compared it to that of its social host, the Bechstein's bat (Myotis bechsteinii). We observed no genetic differentiation between mites living on different bats within a colony. This suggests that mites can move freely among bats of the same colony. As expected in case of restricted inter-colony dispersal, we observed a strong genetic differentiation of mites among demographically isolated bat colonies. In contrast, we found a strong genetic turnover between years when we investigated the temporal variation of mite haplotypes within colonies. This can be explained with mite dispersal occuring between colonies and bottlenecks of mite populations within colonies. The observed absence of isolation by distance could be the result from genetic drift and/or from mites dispersing even between remote bat colonies, whose members may meet at mating sites in autumn or in hibernacula in winter. Our data show that the population structure of this parasitic wing mite is influenced by its own demography and the peculiar social system of its bat host.

Supercooling point plasticity during cold storage in the freeze-tolerant sugarbeet root maggot Tetanops myopaeformis	PHYSIOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												The sugarbeet root maggot Tetanops myopaeformis (Roder) overwinters as a freeze-tolerant third-instar larva. Although most larvae are considered to overwinter for only 1 year, some may exhibit prolonged diapause in the field. In the laboratory, they can live for over 5 years using a combination of diapause and post-diapause quiescence. In the present study, the cold survival strategies of these larvae during storage is investigated by measuring their supercooling points in combination with survival data. Supercooling points (SCPs) change significantly during storage, highlighted by a marked increase in the range of SCPs recorded, although the ability to tolerate freezing is not affected. Additionally, a freezing event 're-focuses' the SCPs of aged larvae to levels similar to those seen at diapause initiation. This change in SCPs is dependant not only on the initial freezing event, but also on the parameters of the incubation period between freezing events. Finally, the temperatures of larval overwintering microhabitats are monitored during the 2007-2008 boreal winter. The results indicate that, although overwintering larva are physiologically freeze-tolerant, they may essentially be freeze avoidant during overwintering via microhabitat selection.																	0307-6962					SEP	2009	34	3					224	230		10.1111/j.1365-3032.2009.00678.x								WOS:000269058600004

RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN INSOLATION AND RATTLESNAKE HIBERNACULA	WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST												We examined the relationships between insolation, climate, and hibernacula of black-tailed (Crotalus molossus), Great Basin (Crotalus lutosus), and western diamondback (Crotalus atrox) rattlesnakes at 4 sites ill Arizona, Nevada, and Utah. Hibernacula were located through a combination of visual searches and radio telemetry from 1995 to 2003. We used global information systems to calculate and compared hibernaculum insolation values with random points representing available insolation of the surrounding habitat. Insolation reflects soil temperatures, and we predicted that hibernacula ill cool climates, at high elevations, and at high latitudes would have higher insolation relative to their surroundings, while hibernacula in warmer climates would not differ from their surroundings in insolation. Coolest temperatures, highest elevations, and highest latitudes occurred oil the C. lutosus and C. molossus sites, where hibernaculum insolation was higher than surrounding insolation. Temperatures were intermediate oil the high-elevation C. atrox site, where hibernaculum insolation did not differ from random-point insolation. Temperatures were highest on the low-elevation C. atrox site, where hibernaculum insolation was unexpectedly lower than random-point insolation. Our observations suggest that rattlesnakes in cool climates utilize hibernacula with insolation values higher than those of their surroundings. Rattlesnakes in warm climates utilize hibernacula with insolation values lower than or similar to those of their surroundings.																	1527-0904					SEP	2009	69	3					319	328		10.3398/064.069.0305								WOS:000271408700005						
J	Navara, KJ				Navara, Kristen J.			Humans at tropical latitudes produce more females	BIOLOGY LETTERS												Skews in the human sex ratio at birth have captivated scientists for over a century. The accepted average human natal sex ratio is slightly male biased, at 106 males per 100 females or 51.5 per cent males. Studies conducted on a localized scale show that sex ratios deviate from this average in response to a staggering number of social, economical and physiological variables. However, these patterns often prove inconsistent when expanded to other human populations, perhaps because the nature of the influences themselves exhibit substantial cultural variation. Here, data collected from 202 countries over a decade show that latitude is a primary factor influencing the ratio of males and females produced at birth; countries at tropical latitudes produced significantly fewer boys (51.1% males) annually than those at temperate and subarctic latitudes (51.3%). This pattern remained strong despite enormous continental variation in lifestyle and socio-economic status, suggesting that latitudinal variables may act as overarching cues on which sex ratio variation in humans is based.																	1744-9561					AUG 23	2009	5	4					524	527		10.1098/rsbl.2009.0069								WOS:000267881700025	19364717					
J	Currie, J; Goda, T; Wijnen, H				Currie, Jake; Goda, Tadahiro; Wijnen, Herman			Selective entrainment of the Drosophila circadian clock to daily gradients in environmental temperature	BMC BIOLOGY												Background: Circadian clocks are internal daily time keeping mechanisms that allow organisms to anticipate daily changes in their environment and to organize their behavior and physiology in a coherent schedule. Although circadian clocks use temperature compensation mechanisms to maintain the same pace over a range of temperatures, they are also capable of synchronizing to daily temperature cycles. This study identifies key properties of this process. Results: Gradually ramping daily temperature cycles are shown here to synchronize behavioral and molecular daily rhythms in Drosophila with a remarkable efficiency. Entrainment to daily temperature gradients of amplitudes as low as 4 degrees C persisted even in the context of environmental profiles that also included continuous gradual increases or decreases in absolute temperature. To determine which elements of daily temperature gradients acted as the key determinants of circadian activity phase, comparative analyses of daily temperature gradients with different wave forms were performed. The phases of ascending and descending temperature acted together as key determinants of entrained circadian phase. In addition, circadian phase was found to be modulated by the relative temperature of release into free running conditions. Release at or close to the trough temperature of entrainment consistently resulted in phase advances. Re-entrainment to daily temperature gradients after large phase shifts occurred relatively slowly and required several cycles, allowing flies to selectively respond to periodic rather than anecdotal signals. The temperature-entrained phase relationship between clock gene expression rhythms and locomotor activity rhythms strongly resembled that previously observed for light entrainment. Moreover, daily temperature gradient and light/dark entrainment reinforced each other if the phases of ascending and descending temperature were in their natural alignment with the light and dark phases, respectively. Conclusion: The present study systematically examined the entrainment of clock-controlled behavior to daily environmental temperature gradients. As a result, a number of key properties of circadian temperature entrainment were identified. Collectively, these properties represent a circadian temperature entrainment mechanism that is optimized in its ability to detect the time-of-day information encoded in natural environmental temperature profiles. The molecular events synchronized to the daily phases of ascending and descending temperature are expected to play an important role in the mechanism of circadian entrainment to daily temperature cycles.

APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY												The effects of climate change on the northern limit of the trivoltine area were clarified in the fall webworm, Hyphantria cunea (Drury) (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae). The Takaoka and Kanazawa populations used in the present study occur in locations to the north of Fukui (36.07 degrees N), where H. cunea has recently shifted from a bivoltine to a predominantly trivoltine life cycle. The life-history traits of these populations were investigated and compared to those in the Fukui population. The lower threshold temperature for development and the thermal constant for one generation were 11.3 degrees C and 674.5 degrees d in the Takaoka population, and 11.2 degrees C and 680.7 degrees d in the Kanazawa population. The critical photoperiod for diapause induction at 25 degrees C was 14 h 34 min in the Takaoka population and 14 h 28 min in the Kanazawa population. These critical photoperiods at 25 degrees C were longer by 24 min and 18 min than the Fukui population, respectively. These results, together with climate data, suggest that the Takaoka population maintains a bivoltine life cycle, and a small part of the Kanazawa population has three generations per year, a predominantly bivoltine life cycle. Thus, the present northern limit of the trivoltine area lies around Fukui in districts along the Japan Sea.																	0003-6862					AUG	2009	44	3					357	362		10.1303/aez.2009.357								WOS:000270738900003

Comparison of Larval Development and Overwintering Stages of the Spotted Knapweed Biological Control Agents Agapeta zoegana (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) and Cyphocleonus achates (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) in Montana Versus Eastern Europe	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												Larval development of insects introduced for biological control of invasive weeds may be constrained if the new climate is more extreme than in their native range. We surveyed larval development in Agapeta zoegana L. and Cyphocleonus achates (Fahraeus), two species of biological control insects introduced from eastern Europe against spotted knapweed in western North America. We dissected spotted knapweed roots collected from five sites in western Montana over 6 yr either in late fall or early spring and measured larval head capsule size to determine the overwintering instar stage. Development of A. zoegana was estimated equally well with late fall or early spring root collections, but C. achates rate of development may be underestimated using fall samples. The larvae of neither species entered diapause in as advanced an instar in western Montana as reported for their native range. Most A. zoegana larvae reached the third (26%) or fourth (20%) instar at diapause, with only 15% reaching sixth instars,as they typically do in their native Eurasia. Almost all (94%) C. achates overwintered as first instars, with most of the remaining (4%) being eggs, some of which were viable in the spring. Only a small number (2%) of C. achates larvae overwintered as second instars, the common overwintering stage in their native range. Slower development may explain, in part, why A. zoegana only has one generation per year in Montana compared with two to three generations per year in Europe.																	0046-225X					AUG	2009	38	4					971	976		10.1603/022.038.0403								WOS:000268659500003	19689874

We previously identified two paralogs encoding phytochrome A (phyA), GmphyA1 and GmphyA2, in soybean, a paleopolyploid species. GmphyA2 is encoded by the E4 locus responsible for photoperiod sensitivity. In photoperiod insensitive lines, GmphyA2 is inactivated by the insertion of a retrotransposon in exon 1. Here, we describe the detailed characterization of the element and its evolutionary significance inferred from the distribution of the allele that harbors the element. Structural characteristics indicated that the element, designated SORE-1, is a novel Ty1/copia-like retrotransposon in soybean, which was phylogenetically related to the Sto-4, BARE-1, and RIRE1 elements. The element was transcriptionally active, and the transcription was partially repressed by an epigenetic mechanism. Sequences homologous with SORE-1 were detected in a genome sequence database of soybean, most of which appeared silent. GmphyA2 that harbors the SORE-1 insertion was detected only in cultivated soybean lines grown in northern regions of Japan, consistent with the notion that photoperiod insensitivity caused by the dysfunction of GmphyA2 is one of genetic changes that allowed soybean cultivation at high latitudes. Taking into account that genetic redundancy is conferred by the two phyA genes, we propose a novel model for the consequences of gene duplication and transposition of retrotransposons: when the gene is duplicated, retrotransposon insertion that causes the loss of a gene function can lead to adaptive evolution while the organism is sustained by the buffering effect brought about by gene duplication.

A genetic analysis using the F(2) population from the cross between HS276 and Gimbozu revealed that the late heading of HS276 is governed by a single recessive mutant gene. The subsequent analysis on heading responses of HS276 and Gimbozu to four photoperiods (12, 13, 14, and 15 h) and to the photoperiodic transfer treatment from a short photoperiod to a long photoperiod revealed that the mutant gene confers an extremely long BVP and increases photoperiod sensitivity under long photoperiod (14 and 15 h). The BVP durations of HS276 and Gimbozu were estimated at 30.1 and 16.0 days, respectively; the mutant gene, compared with its wild type allele, elongates the duration of BVP by 14 days. Linkage analysis showed that the mutant gene is located in the 129 kb region between the two INDEL markers, INDELAP0399_6 and INDELAP3487_2, on the distal part of the short arm of chromosome 6. None of the other BVP genes are located in this region; therefore, we declared this a newly detected mutant gene and designated it ef7. A recently established program to breed rice suitable for low latitudes, where short photoperiodic conditions continue throughout the year, aims to develop varieties with extremely long BVPs and weak photoperiod sensitivities; the mutant gene ef7, therefore, will be quite useful in these programs because it confers an extremely long BVP and little enhances photoperiod sensitivity under short photoperiod.

J	Tops, S; Hartikainen, HL; Okamura, B				Tops, Sylvie; Hartikainen, Hanna-Leena; Okamura, Beth			The effects of infection by Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae (Myxozoa) and temperature on Fredericella sultana (Bryozoa)	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY												The myxozoan, Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae, exploits freshwater bryozoans as definitive hosts, occurring as cryptic stages in bryozoan colonies during covert infections and as spore-forming sacs during overt infections. Spores released from sacs are infective to salmonid fish, causing the devastating Proliferative Kidney Disease (PKD). We undertook laboratory studies using mesocosm systems running at 10, 14 and 20 degrees C to determine how infection by T bryosalmonae and water temperature influence fitness of one of its most important bryozoan hosts, Fredericella sultana, over a period of 4 weeks. The effects of infection were context-dependent and often undetectable. Covert infections appear to pose very low energetic costs. Thus, we found that growth of covertly infected F. sultana colonies was similar to that of uninfected colonies regardless of temperature, as was the propensity to produce dormant resting stages (statoblasts). Production of statoblasts, however, was associated with decreased growth. Overt infections imposed greater effects on correlates of host fitness by: (i) reducing growth rates at the two higher temperatures: (ii) increasing mortality rates at the highest temperature: (iii) inhibiting statoblast production. Our results indicate that parasitism should have a relatively small effect on host fitness in the field as the negative effects of infection were mainly expressed in environmentally extreme conditions (20 degrees C for 4 weeks). The generally low virulence of T. bryosalmonae is similar to that recently demonstrated for another myxozoan endoparasite of freshwater bryozoans. The unique opportunity for extensive vertical transmission in these colonial invertebrate hosts couples the reproductive interests of host and parasite and may well give rise to the low virulence that characterises these systems. Our study implies that climate change can be expected to exacerbate PKD outbreaks and increase the geographic range of PKD as a result of the combined responses of T. bryosalmonae and its bryozoan hosts to higher temperatures.

F.; Darvill, Ben; Goulson, Dave			Impacts of inbreeding on bumblebee colony fitness under field conditions	BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY												Background: Inbreeding and the loss of genetic diversity are known to be significant threats to small, isolated populations. Hymenoptera represent a special case regarding the impact of inbreeding. Haplodiploidy may permit purging of deleterious recessive alleles in haploid males, meaning inbreeding depression is reduced relative to diploid species. In contrast, the impact of inbreeding may be exacerbated in Hymenopteran species that have a single-locus complementary sex determination system, due to the production of sterile or inviable diploid males. We investigated the costs of brother-sister mating in the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. We compared inbred colonies that produced diploid males and inbred colonies that did not produce diploid males with outbred colonies. Mating, hibernation and colony founding took place in the laboratory. Once colonies had produced 15 offspring they were placed in the field and left to forage under natural conditions. Results: The diploid male colonies had a significantly reduced fitness compared to regular inbred and outbred colonies; they had slower growth rates in the laboratory, survived for a shorter time period under field conditions and produced significantly fewer offspring overall. No differences in success were found between non-diploid male inbred colonies and outbred colonies. Conclusion: Our data illustrate that inbreeding exacts a considerable cost in Bombus terrestris through the production of diploid males. We suggest that diploid males may act as indicators of the genetic health of populations, and that their detection could be used as an informative tool in hymenopteran conservation. We conclude that whilst haplodiploids may suffer less inbreeding depression than diploid species, they are still highly vulnerable to population fragmentation and reduced genetic diversity due to the extreme costs imposed by the production of diploid males.

TWO-STEP RAPID FREEZING METHOD: ESTIMATION OF MEMBRANE HYDRAULIC PERMEABILITY IN ERYTHROCYTES AT TEMPERATURE EXPOSURE STAGE	CRYOLETTERS												The processes, occurring at the stage of temperature exposure under two-step freezing of human and hibernating ground squirrel erythrocytes were studied by electron-microscopic method of freeze-fracturing. For human erythrocytes the time of intracellular crystal dissolution in human erythrocytes made 30 min and this value was shown to be slightly depending on temperature within -20 degrees C divided by -35 degrees C range. Erythrocyte membrane permeability for water within negative temperature range has been estimated. It was noted that the value of water membrane permeability coefficient obtained theoretically, taking into account experimental values of time of dissolution for intracellular ice crystals and cell dehydration, is quite well consistent with the reported data and equals to about 0.5 x 10(-13)N(-1)m(3) sec(-1) for human erythrocytes and 10(-13)N(-1)m(3) sec(-1) for hibernating ground squirrel cells. Under two-step freezing a temperature arrest results in a qualitative change of water exchange process between cell and its environment, and the exposure duration may serve as the measure for cell dehydration. According to the data of NMR "paramagnetic doping" and freeze-fracturing the erythrocyte membrane of hibernating ground squirrels is more permeable for water than human one.																	0143-2044					JUL-AUG	2009	30	4					251	261										WOS:000270009100002

The Occurrence of Codling Moth in Low Latitude Countries: Validation of Pest Distribution Reports	HORTTECHNOLOGY												Phytosanitary restrictions are increasingly a factor in the ability of U.S. tree fruit exporters to gain and maintain access to worldwide markets. Under international trade rules, these restrictions must be based on specific guidelines, including an assessment of whether the proposed quarantine pest is likely to establish and spread under the climatic conditions of the importing country. Given the interest in and growth of temperate fruit production in the tropics, countries in the region (such as Taiwan, Columbia, Indonesia, and Thailand) have begun to impose a range of quarantine restrictions aimed at preventing the introduction of temperate zone pests. Apples (Malus xdomestica) are regulated in certain tropical/subtropical countries, such as Taiwan, for the presence of codling moth (CM; Cydia pomonella) in spite of reports in the literature that the distribution of CM is theoretically limited by daylength and chilling requirements to temperate regions. This work provides background as to why CM has been identified as a potential pest of quarantine concern in some low latitude countries; describes an approach used to validate worldwide CM distribution reports, providing additional information to allow for the revision of CM distribution maps; and demonstrates how accurate information regarding pest species distribution reports can aid in establishing an argument of ecological nonadaptability in the pest risk analysis process. Currently, a report of CM in Peru remains the only account of this pest's presence in low latitude countries that could not be refuted by the approach described here.																	1063-0198					JUL-SEP	2009	19	3					633	637										WOS:000279016800024

The Influence of Eastern North American Autumnal Migrant Monarch Butterflies (Danaus plexippus L.) on Continuously Breeding Resident Monarch Populations in Southern Florida	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY												In Florida, the eastern North American population of the monarch butterfly exhibits geographic variability in population structure and dynamics. This includes the occurrence of migrants throughout the peninsula during the autumnal migration, occasional overwintering clusters that form along the Gulf Coast, remigrants from Mexico that breed in north-central Florida during the spring, and what have been assumed to be year-round, resident breeding populations in southern Florida. The work reported here focused on two monarch populations west of Miami and addressed four questions: Are there permanent resident populations of monarchs in southern Florida? Do these breed continuously throughout the year? Do they receive northern monarchs moving south during the autumn migration? Do they receive overwintered monarchs returning via Cuba or the Yucatan during the spring remigration from the Mexican overwintering area? Monthly collections and counts of spermatophores in the bursa copulatrices of females established that a resident population of continuously breeding monarchs exists year-round in southern Florida. It was determined through cardenolide fingerprinting that most of the butterflies had bred on the local southern Florida milkweed species, Asclepias curassavica. During the autumn migration period, however, some monarchs had fed on the northern milkweed, Asclepias syriaca. It appears that instead of migrating to Mexico, these individuals travel south through peninsular Florida, break diapause, mate with and become incorporated into the resident breeding populations. None of the monarchs captured in spring had the A. syriaca cardenolide fingerprint, which is evidence against the southern Florida populations receiving overwintered remigrants from Cuba, Central America or Mexico.																	0098-0331					JUL	2009	35	7					816	823		10.1007/s10886-009-9655-z								WOS:000268250600009	19579046					
J	Chuche, J; Thiery, D				Chuche, Julien; Thiery, Denis			Cold winter temperatures condition the egg-hatching dynamics of a grape disease vector	NATURWISSENSCHAFTEN												The leafhopper Scaphoideus titanus is the vector of a major phytoplasma grapevine disease, Flavescence dor,e. The vector's distribution is in Eastern and Northern Europe, and its population dynamics varies as a function of vineyard latitude. We tested the hypothesis that hatching dynamics are cued by cold temperatures observed in winter. We exposed eggs from a natural population to simulated "cold" and "mild" winters and varied the exposure time at 5 A degrees C from 0 to 63 days. We show that temperature cooling mainly affected the onset of hatching and is negatively correlated to the cold time exposure. The majority of hatchings occurred more quickly in cold rather than in mild winter simulated conditions, but there was no significant difference between the duration of hatching of eggs whatever the cold time exposure. In agreement with the Northern American origin of the vector, the diapause termination and thus the timing regulation of egg hatching require cold winters.

Effect of Age, Photoperiod and Host Availability on the Parasitism Behavior of Oomyzus sokolowskii Kurdjumov (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae)	NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY												The high reproduction rate, potential to cause damage, wide geographic distribution and resistance to insecticides of Plutella xylostella (L.) makes difficult its efficient control. However, larvae and pupae of this pest are naturally parasitized by Oomyzus sokolowskii (Kurdjumov), providing opportunities to improve the natural parasitism. This study investigated the effects of the age of adult parasitoids, host availability and time of exposure on O. sokolowskii parasitism behavior. The number of larvae encounters by parasitoid females and the parasitism rate increased with parasitoid age up to 96h. The parasitization was higher when wasps received a constant number of hosts daily in comparison with a random number (13.3 versus 8.9 larvae parasitized). Female parasitization activity was maintained up to the age of 20 days in both treatments and exhibited similar longevity (constant host = 33.5 d; and random host = 34.7 d). The progeny produced per female and the number of parasitoids emerged per host significantly decreased as wasps aged. There was no significant effect of the light regime (12h darkness or 12h light exposure) on the parasitization, although parasitoid was more active after 3h of light exposure. Therefore, further studies on field application of O. sokolowskii should consider the release of 48h- to 72h-old parasitoids at dawn as a way to increase the success of host parasitization.

THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS												A recently established rice breeding program in low latitudes aims to develop varieties with extremely long basic vegetative growth (BVG) periods and weak photoperiod sensitivities. The Taiwanese japonica variety Taichung 65 (T65) harbors a recessive allele ef1 at the Ef1 (Early flowering 1) locus, thereby exhibiting an extremely long BVG period. The previous reported functional allele Ehd1 (Early heading date 1), located on chromosome 10, encodes a B-type response regulator, thereby shortening the BVG period, whereas its nonfunctional allele ehd1 greatly prolongs the BVG period. A conventional analysis using F(2) and F(3) populations and a subsequent CAPS analysis based on the amino acid sequences of Ehd1 and ehd1 showed that Ef1 and Ehd1 were at the same locus. The CAPS analysis also indicated that the Taiwanese japonica varieties with extremely long BVG periods all harbor ef1, but that ef1 does not exist among indica and japonica varieties in the low latitudes. Since ef1 has not been found in any japonica varieties outside Taiwan, this allele might have originated in Taiwan. Sequence analysis revealed that the mutant allele ef1-h, which prolongs the BVG period even more than ef1 does, harbors an mPing insertion in exon 2, which causes the complete loss of gene function. Our results indicate that both ef1 or ef1-h alleles can be used as new gene sources in developing rice varieties with extremely long BVG periods for low latitudes.

Temperature has a causal effect on avian timing of reproduction	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Many bird species reproduce earlier in years with high spring temperatures, but little is known about the causal effect of temperature. Temperature may have a direct effect on timing of reproduction but the correlation may also be indirect, for instance via food phenology. As climate change has led to substantial shifts in timing, it is essential to understand this causal relationship to predict future impacts of climate change. We tested the direct effect of temperature on laying dates in great tits (Parus major) using climatized aviaries in a 6-year experiment. We mimicked the temperature patterns from two specific years in which our wild population laid either early ('warm' treatment) or late ('cold' treatment). Laying dates were affected by temperature directly. As the relevant temperature period started three weeks prior to the mean laying date, with a range of just 4 degrees C between the warm and the cold treatments, and as the birds were fed ad libitum, it is likely that temperature acted as a cue rather than lifting an energetic constraint on the onset of egg production. We furthermore show a high correlation between the laying dates of individuals reproducing both in aviaries and in the wild, validating investigations of reproduction of wild birds in captivity. Our results demonstrate that temperature has a direct effect on timing of breeding, an important step towards assessing the implication of climate change on seasonal timing.

Presented here is a study on the life history of a mayfly species, Serratella ignita, in two Mediterranean streams, one permanent and one temporary. The research focuses on life history parameters such as life cycle, nymphal growth pattern, feeding type, biomass and secondary production. The life cycle was univoltine, showing a fast seasonal nymphal growth during four months in the permanent stream and five months in the temporary stream, with a long egg stage with diapause. The cumulated day-degrees during nymphal growth were similar between streams. Both populations behaved mainly as gatherer-collectors, but the population from the temporary stream also played an important role as a scraper. Animal matter was also consumed by nymphs from both populations. Gut content analysis showed that both S. ignita populations were opportunist/generalists, where changes in diet were correlated with size. Biomass and secondary production were notably higher in the permanent stream, but they were also high in the temporary stream. These data show that S. ignita had a high fitness in both streams. Our results support the idea that species such as this one may cope with future global climate change by maintaining, or even increasing, their populations at the expense of more stenoecic species.

BIOLOGICAL BULLETIN												The wide geographical distribution of the Norway lobster, Nephrops norvegicus, results in a delay, with latitudinal decrease, in the larval season from spring to winter. Newly hatched larvae of the species may therefore be exposed to Suboptimal levels or types of prey and face intermittent periods of starvation at low latitudes. This work investigated the feeding response of the first two zoeal stages of N. norvegicus under variable prey densities, prey types, feeding histories, and photoperiods. Both zoeae (Z) I and II increased the number of consumed prey with increasing food levels. ZI preferred Artemia sp. nauphii over larger metanauplii, while in ZII, higher ingestion was observed only for metanauplii at higher food concentrations. The number of prey ingested by larvae previously starved or under low food conditions was always higher than that of larvae exposed to high food levels. These findings seem to indicate that larvae may maximize prey ingestion in the presence of plankton patches with higher food abundance and minimize the deleterious effects induced by previous periods of intermittent starvation or unsuitable prey densities or types. Extreme photoperiods (24 and 0 h of light) did not improve larval feeding ability and are not a suitable option for larviculture.

As a result, four genetically and ecologically distinct R. pomonella populations that display partial reproductive isolation have evolved. Host shifting by Rhagoletis and similar evolutionary histories could have had cascading effects across trophic levels, influencing the diversity and distribution of associated parasitoid guilds. To establish the basis for a future understanding of the possible effect of divergence in R. pomonella populations on the parasitoids attacking these flies, we surveyed parasitoids from five different species of hawthorns distributed over 15 states in Mexico and 2 states in the midwestern United States. Emerging parasitoids were identified, parasitism rates were calculated, and regional fly and parasitoid emergence schedules were determined. Parasitism rate, emergence schedules, Shannon-Weiner diversity indexes, and species accumulation curves were compared across three main geographical regions. Parasitism levels varied greatly among regions from an overall high of 27.2% in the United States to 5.5% in the Sierra Madre Oriental (SMO) mountains of Mexico, to as low as 0.19% in the Eje Volcanico Trans Mexicano (EVTM). Shannon-Weiner diversity indexes showed that parasitoid species diversity was similar across the distribution range of R. pomonella in Mexico and the United States because of the fact that total parasitism was dominated by only two species, one of them recovered across the whole North American range of hawthorn infesting Rhagoletis. Nevertheless, eight parasitoids were found attacking R. pomonella in Mexico compared with only four collected in the United States. Only two diapausing parasitoid species were shared between the U.S. and Mexican R. pomonella populations: Utetes canaliculatus and Diachasmimorpha mellea. Interestingly, many subtropical parasitoid species, usually associated to flies in the subtropical genus Anastrepha, were recovered in the SMO in low numbers. The wide distribution of U. canaliculatus and D. mellea offers an ideal opportunity to test for a shared biogeography and co-evolution between fly and parasitoids. In this regard, one factor contributing to the success of U canaliculatus seems to be the wasp's ability to modulate its eclosion time to track regional variation in hawthorn fruiting phenology and host (i.e., fly larvae) availability. Both R. pomonella and U. canaliculatus from southern sites emerged later than insects from northern populations, mirroring seasonal differences in hawthorn fruiting times across Mexico and the United States. These results suggest that molecular studies and crossing experiments could show, as they have for Rhagoletis, recent speciation events for parasitoid species of Nearctic origin that were found to be ecologically tracking environmentally driven divergence of their tephritid hosts.																	0046-225X					JUN	2009	38	3					588	599		10.1603/022.038.0310								WOS:000266655800010	19508767

Similar hatching or germination patterns are observed in desert plants, copepods, rotifers, insects, and many other species. Bet hedging theory suggests that parents stagger offspring emergence into vulnerable life history stages in order to avoid catastrophic reproductive failures. For Ae. triseriatus, a treehole breeding mosquito, immediate hatching of an entire clutch leaves all of the parent's progeny vulnerable to extinction in the event of a severe drought. Natural selection has likely favored parents that pursued a bet hedging strategy where the risk of reproductive failure is distributed over time. Considering treehole mosquitoes, bet hedging theory could be used to predict that hatch delay would be positively correlated with the likelihood of drought. To test this prediction, we collected Ae. triseriatus from habitats that varied widely in mean annual precipitation and exposed them to several hatch stimuli in the laboratory. Here we report that, as predicted, Ae. triseriatus eggs from high precipitation regions showed less hatch delay than areas of low precipitation. This strategy probably allows Ae. triseriatus to cope with the wide variety of climatic conditions that it faces in its extensive geographical range.

An individual-based model	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY												Decisions taken during migration can have a large effect on the fitness of birds. Migration must be accurately timed with food availability to allow efficient fueling but is also constrained by the optimal arrival date at the breeding site. The decision of when to leave a site can be driven by energetics (sufficient body stores to fuel flight), time-related cues (internal clock under photoperiodic control), or external cues (temperature, food resources). An individual based model (IBM) that allows a mechanistic description of a range of departure decision rules was applied to the spring migration of pink-footed geese (Anser brachyrhynchus) from wintering grounds in Denmark to breeding grounds on Svalbard via 2 Norwegian staging sites. By comparing predicted with observed departure dates, we tested 7 decision rules. The most accurate predictions were obtained from a decision rule based on a combination of cues including the amount of body stores, date, and plant phenology. Decision rules changed over the course of migration with the external cue decreasing in importance and the time-related cue increasing in importance for sites closer to breeding grounds. These results are in accordance with descriptions of goose migration, following the "green-wave": Geese track the onset of plant growth as it moves northward in spring, with an uncoupling toward the end of the migration if time is running out. We demonstrate the potential of IBMs to study the possible mechanisms underlying stopover ecology in migratory birds and to serve as tools to predict consequences of environmental change.

Both the early and late phases of scotophase were sensitive to light and a light pulse during each of these phases prevented diapause. Certain physiological differences between the phases were, nevertheless, detected. Compared with early scotophase, late scotophase required a light pulse with a long period and a large number of night interruption photoperiodic cycles in order to effectively prevent diapause. The diapause-averting effects of a light pulse during early scotophase were canceled by an additional long dark period, but those during late scotophase were not. Thus, the diapause-averting effects produced during early scotophase are different to those produced during late scotophase. The early scotophase was sensitive to light at wavelengths of 470 nm or shorter, but not to light of 583 nm or longer. In contrast, the late scotophase was sensitive to light of a broad range of wavelengths, ranging from 395 to 660 nm. Furthermore, the early scotophase was considerably more sensitive to monochromatic light with low photon flux density than the late scotophase. These results suggest that different types of photoreceptor are involved in the photoperiodic response. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Large spinose microfossils in Ediacaran rocks as resting stages of early animals	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Large (> 100 mu m), profusely ornamented microfossils comprise a distinctive paleontological component of sedimentary rocks deposited during the Ediacaran Period (635-542 million years ago). Smaller spinose fossils in Paleozoic rocks have commonly been interpreted as algal cysts or phycomata, but the Ediacaran populations differ from modern algal analogs in size, shape, ultrastructure, and internal contents. In contrast, cysts formed during the diapause egg-resting stages of many metazoans share features of size, ornamentation, and internal contents with large ornamented Ediacaran microfossils (LOEMs). Moreover, transmission electron microscopic observations of animal-resting cysts reveal a 3-layer wall ultrastructure comparable to that of LOEM taxa. Interpretation of these distinctive Ediacaran microfossils as resting stages in early metazoan life cycles offers additional perspectives on their functional morphology and stratigraphic distribution. Based on comparisons with modern marine invertebrates, the recalcitrant life stage represented by LOEMs is interpreted as an evolutionary response to prolonged episodes of bottom water anoxia in Ediacaran shelf and platform environments. As predicted by this hypothesis, the later Ediacaran disappearance of LOEM taxa coincides with geochemical evidence for a marked decline in the extent of oxygen-depleted waters impinging on continental shelves and platforms. Thus, the form, diversity, and stratigraphic range of LOEMs illuminate life cycle evolution in early animals as influenced by the evolving redox state of the oceans.																	0027-8424					APR 21	2009	106	16					6519	6524		10.1073/pnas.0902322106								WOS:000265506800019	19366668

Recent studies show that cryoconites are colonized by a diverse range of microorganisms, including viruses, bacteria and algae. Whether microbial communities on the surface of glaciers are actively influencing biogeochemical cycles or are just present in a dormant state has been a matter of debate for long time. Here, we report primary production and community respiration of cryoconite holes upon glaciers in Svalbard, Greenland and the European Alps. Microbial activity in cryoconite holes is high despite maximum temperatures seldom exceeding 0.1 degrees C. In situ primary production and respiration in cryoconites during the summer is often comparable with that found in soils in warmer and nutrient richer regions. Considering only glacier areas outside Antarctica and a conservative average cryoconite distribution on glacial surfaces, we found that on a global basis cryoconite holes have the potential to fix as much as 64 Gg of carbon per year (i.e. 98 Gg of photosynthesis minus 34 Gg of community respiration). Most lakes and rivers are generally considered as heterotrophic systems, but our results suggest that glaciers, which contain 75% of the freshwater of the planet, are largely autotrophic systems.

Evolution of photoperiodic time measurement is independent of the circadian clock in the pitcher-plant mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY A-NEUROETHOLOGY SENSORY NEURAL AND BEHAVIORAL PHYSIOLOGY												For over 70 years, researchers have debated whether the ability to use day length as a cue for the timing of seasonal events (photoperiodism) is related to the endogenous circadian clock that regulates the timing of daily events. Models of photoperiodism include two components: (1) a photoperiodic timer that measures the length of the day, and (2) a photoperiodic counter that elicits the downstream photoperiodic response after a threshold number of days has been counted. Herein, we show that there is no geographical pattern of genetic association between the expression of the circadian clock and the photoperiodic timer or counter. We conclude that the photoperiodic timer and counter have evolved independently of the circadian clock in the pitcher-plant mosquito Wyeomyia smithii and hence, the evolutionary modification of photoperiodism throughout the range of W. smithii has not been causally mediated by a corresponding evolution of the circadian clock.

J	Sonnante, G; Hammer, K; Pignone, D				Sonnante, Gabriella; Hammer, Karl; Pignone, Domenico			From the cradle of agriculture a handful of lentils: History of domestication	RENDICONTI LINCEI-SCIENZE FISICHE E NATURALI												Literature on lentil domestication is reviewed, particularly considering archeobotanical, phylogenetic, and molecular evidence. Lentils are one of the oldest crops cultivated and domesticated by man. Carbonized small lentil seeds have been found in several archaeological remains starting from the Neolithic. It is probable, however, that the most ancient remains refer to wild lentils; this is difficult to ascertain since seed size was probably selected after the establishment of a domesticated lentil. It is general opinion that cultivation occurred before domestication, but for how long is still an open question. It is now well accepted that the domestication of lentils was accomplished in the Near East, in an area called "the cradle of agriculture". The genus Lens is very small, containing only 6 taxa. A wide range of morphological and molecular evidence supports the idea that the lentil wild progenitor is Lens culinaris ssp. orientalis. On the other hand, the most distantly related species within the genus appears to be L. nigricans, whose domestication was also attempted without success. The first characters involved in lentil domestication were pod dehiscence and seed dormancy. These traits are under a simple genetic control, and therefore mutants must have been fixed in a relatively short time. These and other morphological traits possibly involved in lentil domestication have been mapped in several linkage maps. However, generally these maps are not easily integrated since they are based on a limited number of markers. Newer maps, mainly built on different kinds of molecular markers, have been more recently produced. A consensus map is needed to fill the gap in lentil breeding and, at the same time, endow with deeper information on the genetics of lentil domestication, giving new insight into the origins of this crop, which present fragmented knowledge is unable.

Introduction, Scenarios for Establishment and Seasonal Activity of Aedes albopictus in The Netherlands	VECTOR-BORNE AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES												The Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus was detected for the first time in the Netherlands in the summer of 2005. Aedes albopictus is a competent vector of several human viral diseases, and therefore the recent appearance of the vector is a concern to local public health authorities. In 2006 and 2007, the mosquito was found repeatedly and regularly at Lucky bamboo import companies. To assess whether imported Ae. albopictus could establish to produce subsequent generations in the following years or whether the winter conditions in the Netherlands would prove too cold to allow overwintering of diapausing eggs, predictions were made using a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) model based on January average temperature and the annual precipitation recorded in 2006. Seasonal activity of overwintering Ae. albopictus was estimated for temperate strains based on the weekly average temperature and weekly photoperiod using spring egg hatching thresholds of 10.5 degrees C and 11.25 hours, and egg diapause and adult survival thresholds of 9.5 degrees C and 13.5 hours. The analyses indicate that the climate conditions in the Netherlands over the past 10 years were favorable to allow overwintering of diapausing eggs of temperate strains of Ae. albopictus, particularly in the western coastal region. This region was also the area where adult Ae. albopictus were intercepted inside and surrounding plant glasshouses. The estimated number of weeks elapsing between first egg hatching in spring and the production of diapausing eggs in autumn ranged between 17 and 22 weeks in 2006.																	1530-3667					APR	2009	9	2					191	196		10.1089/vbz.2008.0038								WOS:000265416200009	18973446

Defining behavioral and molecular differences between summer and migratory monarch butterflies	BMC BIOLOGY												Background: In the fall, Eastern North American monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) undergo a magnificent long-range migration. In contrast to spring and summer butterflies, fall migrants are juvenile hormone deficient, which leads to reproductive arrest and increased longevity. Migrants also use a time-compensated sun compass to help them navigate in the south/southwesterly direction en route for Mexico. Central issues in this area are defining the relationship between juvenile hormone status and oriented flight, critical features that differentiate summer monarchs from fall migrants, and identifying molecular correlates of behavioral state. Results: Here we show that increasing juvenile hormone activity to induce summer-like reproductive development in fall migrants does not alter directional flight behavior or its time-compensated orientation, as monitored in a flight simulator. Reproductive summer butterflies, in contrast, uniformly fail to exhibit directional, oriented flight. To define molecular correlates of behavioral state, we used microarray analysis of 9417 unique cDNA sequences. Gene expression profiles reveal a suite of 40 genes whose differential expression in brain correlates with oriented flight behavior in individual migrants, independent of juvenile hormone activity, thereby molecularly separating fall migrants from summer butterflies. Intriguing genes that are differentially regulated include the clock gene vrille and the locomotion-relevant tyramine beta hydroxylase gene. In addition, several differentially regulated genes (37.5% of total) are not annotated. We also identified 23 juvenile hormone-dependent genes in brain, which separate reproductive from non-reproductive monarchs; genes involved in longevity, fatty acid metabolism, and innate immunity are upregulated in non-reproductive (juvenile-hormone deficient) migrants. Conclusion: The results link key behavioral traits with gene expression profiles in brain that differentiate migratory from summer butterflies and thus show that seasonal changes in genomic function help define the migratory state.

However, the molecular mechanisms promoting the diversity of flowering time in cultivated rice are not known. We used a core collection of 64 rice cultivars that represent the genetic diversity of 332 accessions from around the world and studied the expression levels and polymorphisms of 6 genes in the short-day flowering pathway. The RNA levels of Heading date 3a (Hd3a), encoding a floral activator, are highly correlated with flowering time, and there is a high degree of polymorphism in the Heading date 1 (Hd1) protein, which is a major regulator of Hd3a expression. Functional and nonfunctional alleles of Hd1 are associated with early and late flowering, respectively, suggesting that Hd1 is a major determinant of variation in flowering time of cultivated rice. We also found that the type of Hd3a promoter and the level of Ehd1 expression contribute to the diversity in flowering time and Hd3a expression level. We evaluated the contributions of these 3 factors by a statistical analysis using a simple linear model, and the results supported our experimental observations.

J	Trillmich, F; Mueller, B; Kaiser, S; Krause, J				Trillmich, Fritz; Mueller, Birte; Kaiser, Sylvia; Krause, Jana			Puberty in female cavies (Cavia aperea) is affected by photoperiod and social conditions	PHYSIOLOGY & BEHAVIOR												In many environments, photoperiod is a reliable predictor of ecological conditions. Such predictability generally declines towards low latitudes as the yearly cycle becomes less marked. It has been claimed that photoperiodic effects are small in cavies and guinea pigs that reproduce throughout the year. We here investigated photoperiodic influences on the onset of puberty in female cavies (Cavia aperea) and show that photoperiod exerts a major influence. Female pups kept in groups of two matured at about 47 days when born into lengthening (from 10:14 to 12.5:11.5 L:D) and 79 days when born into shortening day length (from 145:9.5 to 12:12 L:D) and kept under identical short day conditions after weaning on day 20 of life (12.25:11.75 L:D). As shown previously, social conditions, especially the presence of an adult male, proved important modifiers of the onset of maturity in females. Differential stress cannot be responsible for the social effects on puberty as social conditions did not affect cortisol levels in young females. We conclude that photoperiod plays an important role in gearing the onset of cavy reproduction to the seasons and that specific male stimuli rather than unspecific effects of stressors accelerate female maturation.

Data were collected from December 17, 2003 to October 22, 2004 at Laojunshan in northwestern Yunnan province, China. The average DPL of the monkey group was 909 + 472 m (n = 291), with the shortest distance being 180 m and the longest distance 3,626 m. Ambient temperature and day length were found to affect DPL. Both factors were positively correlated with DPL,, which means that the monkey group traveled greater distances on longer and warmer days. At the study site, three distinct seasons were identified, and DPL did not vary significantly across these periods. The time of sunrise was not correlated with DPL. Nevertheless, we sometimes observed the group starting its daily trip later on cloudy days than on sunny days. Furthermore, weather conditions (e.g. rainy, cloudy, and sunny) did not influence the average DPL of the study group. Overall we found that the primary factors affecting DPL in R. bieti were day length and ambient temperature, especially daily highest temperature. Am. J. Primatol. 71:233-241, 2009.

Rapid climate change promotes changes in distribution ranges of Nezara viridula and Nezara antennata in Japan	ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA												We compared past and current limits of the distribution range of the southern green stink bug, Nezara viridula (L.) (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae), in central Japan. In the early 1960s, the northern limit of the range was in Wakayama Prefecture and was limited by a +5 degrees C isothermal line for the mean January temperature. In 2006-2007, a new survey demonstrated that this northern limit had shifted northwards by 85 km (i.e., at a mean rate of 19.0 km per decade). The shift was most likely promoted by milder winter conditions. The mean January to February temperature in the region was 1.03-1.91 degrees C higher in 1998-2007 than in 1960-1969. The number of cold days (with the mean temperature below +5 degrees C) also significantly decreased, while the annual lowest temperature significantly increased. Nezara viridula was found mostly close to those locations where (i) the mean January temperature exceeded +5 degrees C, (ii) the mean number of cold days did not exceed 26 in January to February, and (iii) where the mean annual lowest temperature did not drop below -3.0 degrees C. The general linear model shows that the mean January temperature and number of cold days are the most important factors controlling the northern limit of distribution of N. viridula. All the climatic data suggest that over the last 45 years, environmental conditions have become more favourable for overwintering of N. viridula at many locations in central Japan. This has probably promoted the northward spread of the species, representing a direct response to climate warming. A sympatrically distributed congeneric, Nezara antennata Scott, seems to respond to the warming by a retreat from the ocean coast towards cooler elevated habitats, which might be a complex response to elevated temperature and interspecific mating with N. viridula. It is suggested that the range changes in both species will continue in response to further climate change.

Leaf litter is an important mediator of soil respiration in an oak-dominated forest	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY												The contribution of the organic (O) horizon to total soil respiration is poorly understood even though it can represent a large source of uncertainty due to seasonal changes in microclimate and O horizon properties due to plant phenology. Our objectives were to partition the CO(2) effluxes of litter layer and mineral soil from total soil respiration (SR) and determine the relative importance of changing temperature and moisture mediating the fluxes. We measured respiration in an oak-dominated forest with or without the O horizon for 1 year within the Oak Openings Region of northwest Ohio. Mineral soil and O horizon respiration were subtracted from mineral soil respiration (MSR) to estimate litter respiration (LR). Measurements were grouped by oak phenology to correlate changes in plant activity with respiration. The presence of the O horizon represented a large source of seasonal variation in SR. The timing of oak phenology explained some of the large changes in both SR and LR, and their relationship with temperature and moisture. The contribution to SR of respiration from the mineral soil was greatest during pre-growth and pre-dormancy, as evident by the low LR:MSR ratios of 0.65 +/- 0.10 (mean +/- SE) and 0.69 +/- 0.03, respectively, as compared to the other phenophases. Including moisture increased our ability to predict MSR and SR during the growth phenophase and LR for every phenophase. Temperature and moisture explained 85% of the variation in MSR, but only 60% of the variation in LR. The annual contribution of O horizon to SR was 48% and the ratio of litter to soil respiration was tightly coupled over a wide range of environmental conditions. Our results suggest the presence of the O horizon is a major mediator of SR.

Exposure of larvae reared under short-day conditions to 4 weeks of long days can induce phase-dependent phase shifts. In the present study, we examined the range of photoperiodic changes effective for phase shifts at 20A degrees C. For larvae under light/dark (LD) 12:12 conditions, 4-week exposure to LD 14:10 caused a clear phase delay, as great an extent as that brought about by exposure to LD 15:9 and LD 16:8. In contrast, the delay brought about by exposure to LD 13:9 was slight. For larvae under LD 10:14, exposure to LD 14:10 and LD 16:8 for 4 weeks induced a phase delay, but exposure to LD 12:12 did not. These results indicate that a clear phase delay is induced when the photoperiodic change exceeds a critical value in the photophase between 13 and 14 h, regardless of the amplitude of the change. Although phase advances were smaller than phase delays, they depended on the amplitude of photoperiodic changes rather than the absolute photophase duration in contrast to the case of the phase delay.

Mendelian Inheritance of Pupal Diapause in the Flesh Fly, Sarcophaga bullata	JOURNAL OF HEREDITY												Pupal diapause (dormancy) in the flesh fly, Sarcophaga bullata, is induced by short-day photoperiods and low temperature. In this study, the inheritance mode of diapause was investigated by crossing a nondiapausing (nd) strain of S. bullata with 2 diapausing strains having different diapause capacities. The results consistently indicated that diapause incidence is inherited in a simple Mendelian pattern, thus a single gene or a small gene cluster linked to the photoperiodic clock controls the seasonal response of diapause. The fact that the nd strain lacked daily rhythmicity in adult eclosion and showed altered expression of 2 circadian clock genes suggests that the photoperiodic and circadian clocks are related through a shared molecular component in S. bullata.																	0022-1503					MAR-APR	2009	100	2					251	255		10.1093/jhered/esn082								WOS:000263420000015	18836144

Microsatellite Characterization of Subspecies and Their Hybrids in Culex pipiens Complex (Diptera: Culicidae) Mosquitoes Along a North-South Transect in the Central United States	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY												Mosquitoes in the Culex pipiens complex, Cx. p. pipiens L. and Cx. p. quinquefasciatus Say are morphologically similar and important vectors of West Nile and St. Louis Encephalitis viruses in the United States. The subspecies differ with respect to overwintering strategies, with Cx. p, pipiens entering diapause in response to winter conditions and Cx. p. quinquefasciatus lacking this ability, yet they hybridize when found in sympatry. Specimens (n = 646) were collected using gravid traps set along a transect from New Orleans, LA, to Chicago, IL. Microsatellite markers were used to: genetically characterize subspecies and hybrids, determine the degree and extent of hybridization to better define the hybrid zone, and examine the efficacy of hybrid detection between microsatellites and a single-gene assay based on the acetylcholinesterase 2 gene (HotAce.2). The results support the presence of two distinct genetic entities, with a broad, stable hybrid zone in between. Admixture analyses classified >40% of individuals as hybrids. Allelic richness was markedly different at the northern and southern ends of the transect, and there was a significant isolation by distance effect. The hybrid zone seems to be wider and extends further to the south than previous work indicated, and as a result, we propose new boundaries compared with those indicated by a previous study. Microsatellites detected more hybrids than the HotAce.2 assay, although the latter assay remains useful as a screening tool. We suggest that the parental subspecies and the hybrid zone are maintained by heterosis combined with selection for diapause at northern latitudes.

Synchronicity and Geographic Variation in Oregon White Oak Acorn Production in the Pacific Northwest	NORTHWEST SCIENCE												We explored geographic patterns and synchrony of Oregon white oak (Quercus garryana) acorn production over 8 years from Vancouver Island, British Columbia to Medford, Oregon. We divided our data into geographic areas: Puget-Willamette Trough, Columbia Gorge-East Cascades (Eastside) xeric, Eastside mesic, Cascade Mountain foothills, Roseburg, and Medford to compare annual acorn production among areas. We observed high within-area synchrony, but synchrony across areas was only apparent in 2004 and 2006 (high production), and 2005 (low production). Correlogram analysis indicated significant acorn crop correlation throughout the Puget-Willamette Trough, but synchrony was higher over greater distances among stands than among trees. Relationships between acorn production and mean monthly temperature or precipitation were examined with correlation analyses for each month between floral initiation and acorn maturation over 8 years of observations. Acorn production in the Puget-Willamette Trough was negatively correlated with spring precipitation, possibly due to an effect on floral processes, and winter temperature, which might relate to bud chilling requirements. In Eastside uplands, June precipitation positively correlated with current acorn production, but negatively correlated with the following year's production suggesting a climatically mediated depression by one year's production on that in the following year. Eastside production negatively correlated with precipitation in March suggesting precipitation interferes with floral processes at that time. We developed predictive linear regression models for the two analysis areas with largest sample sizes. Oregon white oak masting is similar to that in other white oaks in terms of periodicity and the effects of spring weather, but is also influenced by other weather related factors following floral induction.

J	Varpe, O; Jorgensen, C; Tarling, GA; Fiksen, O				Varpe, Oystein; Jorgensen, Christian; Tarling, Geraint A.; Fiksen, Oyvind			The adaptive value of energy storage and capital breeding in seasonal environments	OIKOS												Timing of reproduction in a seasonal cycle is a life history trait with important fitness consequences. Capital breeders produce offspring from stored resources and, by decoupling feeding and reproduction, may bend the constraints caused by seasonality in food or predation. Income breeders, on the other hand, produce offspring from concurrent food intake, with the disadvantage of less flexibility, but with high efficiency and no inventory costs of carrying stores. Here, we assess relative profitability of capital and income breeding in herbivorous zooplankton inhabiting seasonal, high-latitude environments. We apply a state-dependent life history model where reproductive values are used to optimise energy allocation and diapause strategies over the year. Three environmental scenarios were modelled: an early, an intermediate, and a late feeding season. We found that capital breeding was most important in the early season. Capital breeding ranged from 7-9% of the eggs produced but, because of the high reproductive value of early eggs, capital breeding ranged from 9-30% when measured in terms of reproductive value. The main benefit of capital breeding was reproduction prior to the feeding season - when the reproductive value of an egg peaked. In addition, capital breeding was also used to increase egg production rates at times of income breeding. For individuals born late in the season the model predicted a two-year cycle instead of the typical annual life cycle. These individuals could then reap the benefits of early reproduction and capital breeding in their second year instead of income breeding late in the first year. We emphasize the importance of evaluating reproductive strategies such as capital and income breeding from a complete life cycle perspective. In particular, knowing the seasonality in offspring fitness is essential to appreciate evolutionary and population-level consequences of capital breeding.

The life history and nymphal generic character development of Sweltsa adamantea Surdick (Plecoptera; Chloroperlidae) in an Oregon summer-dry headwater stream	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY												This is only the second report of the life history, and first on ontogenic nymphal development, for any of the 22 western species of North American Sweltsa. Concurrent monthly collections of nymphs, with bi-weekly collections of adults from emergence traps, from an intermittent Oregon stream over 10 years yielded an interesting assemblage of stoneflies, including Sweltsa adamantea with no congeners. Adults were taken from emergence traps from 2001 to 2007, and the head-capsule widths of 1,159 nymphs from 1999 to 2007 collections were individually measured. Counts of antennal and cereal segments, windpad presence and backward projecting length, presence of dark, thoracic sternocoxal hairs (a diagnostic character in late instar Sweltsa), diameter of compound eyes, general presence and length of body hairs, and sexual dimorphism were determined for 68 nymphs representing an array of 0.27 to 1.86nun head capsule widths from 2004 to 2007 collections. Eggs were studied and photographed with SEM. The life cycle was semivoltine; adult emergence was from late March to late July, with a peak from May I to June 15. The recruitment of a new cohort of nymphs before early emergence indicated an egg diapause for at least much of the first year. Growth of nymphs was slow through the warm, dry summer. accelerated in fall beginning about September, and rapid from December until emergence. Smallest field-sampled nymphs (0.27 to 0.50mm head capsule width) had 16-18 antennal segments, 5-6 cereal segments., 0.03mm diameter compound eyes. and no wingpads, dark sternocoxal hairs or sexual dimorphism. Progressive development of all these and other noted setal characters occurred until pre-emergent size. Antennal and cereal segments more than doubled in number, and win-pads, dark sternocoxal hairs and sexual dimorphism became discernible at specific how sizes. Eggs were oval, measured 234x340 mu m, had no collar, and had a finely punctuate chorion.

Characterization of Basal Seminal Traits and Reproductive Endocrine Profiles in North American River Otters and Asian Small-Clawed Otters	ZOO BIOLOGY												In this Study, fecal samples were collected from 24 North American river (NARO) and 17 Asian small-clawed otters (ASCO) for 6-36 months and semen collected seasonally from NARO males (n = 4/season) via electroejaculation. Our main objectives were to: (1) characterize endocrine parameters by longitudinal monitoring of fecal hormone metabolites and (2) investigate semen collection and basal seminal traits in NARO. NARO demonstrated a distinct seasonality in the spring, with females having a monoestrual estrogen elevation lasting 15.33 +/- 1.98 (mean +/- SEM) days and males peaking in testosterone production for 25.50 +/- 7.51 days. Pregnancy was characterized by 7-9 months of basal fecal progesterone, presumably corresponding to embryonic diapause, followed by a rapid increase over the final 68-73 days to term. Pseudopregnancy exhibited a similar late winter progesterone peak of 68-72 days, which could not be differentiated from pregnancy. Geographic latitude possibly influenced the timing of increased testosterone in males and increased progesterone in pregnant/pseudopregnant females. In ASCO, monitoring of fecal estrogens did not allow consistent detection of peak values associated with behavioral estrus. Both pregnancy and pseudopregnancy were characterized by it moderate rise in fecal progesterone for 14-16 days postovulation followed by a marked increase. Total gestation length was 67-77 days compared with 62-84 days for pseudopregnancy. In NARO, optimal sperm recovery and quality occurred only in the spring, corresponding with seasonal increases in testicular volume and fecal testosterone. These findings represent the first comprehensive information on normative endocrine and seminal traits in freshwater otter species. Zoo Biol 28:107-126, 2009. (C) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

We grew mutants impaired in different signaling pathways in field experiments across the species' native European range in order to dissect the mechanisms underlying this variation. Unexpectedly, mutational loss at loci implicated in the cold requirement for flowering had little effect on life history except in late- summer cohorts. A genetically informed photothermal model of progression toward flowering explained most of the observed variation and predicted an abrupt transition from autumn flowering to spring flowering in late- summer germinants. Environmental signals control the timing of this transition, creating a critical window of acute sensitivity to genetic and climatic change that may be common for seasonally regulated life history traits.

Hippocampal volumes and neuron numbers increase along a gradient of environmental harshness: a large-scale comparison	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Environmental conditions may provide specific demands for memory, which in turn may affect specific brain regions responsible for memory function. For food-caching animals, in particular, spatial memory appears to be important because it may have a direct effect on fitness via the accuracy of cache retrieval. Animals living in more harsh environments should rely more on cached food, and thus theoretically should have better memory to support cache retrieval, which may be crucial for survival. Consequently, animals in harsh environments may benefit from more neurons within a larger hippocampus (Hp), a part of the brain involved in spatial memory. Here, we present the first large-scale test of the hypothesis that Hp structure is related to the severity of the environment within a single food-caching species (the black-capped chickadee, Poecile atricapillus) with a large range encompassing a great diversity of climatic conditions. Hp size in birds collected at five locations along a gradient of environmental harshness from Alaska to Kansas ranked perfectly with climatic severity. Birds from more harsh northern climates (defined by lower ambient temperature, shorter day length and more snow cover) had significantly larger Hp volumes and more Hp neurons (both relative to telencephalon volume) than those from more mild southern latitudes. Environmental pressures therefore seem capable of influencing specific brain regions independently, which may result in enhanced memory, and hence survival, in harsh climates.																	0962-8452					FEB 7	2009	276	1656					401	405		10.1098/rspb.2008.1184								WOS:000262002400002	18945667

What parts of the US mainland are climatically suitable for invasive alien pythons spreading from Everglades National Park?	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												The Burmese Python (Python molurus bivittatus) is now well established in southern Florida and spreading northward. The factors likely to limit this spread are unknown, but presumably include climate or are correlated with climate. We compiled monthly rainfall and temperature statistics from 149 stations located near the edge of the python's native range in Asia (Pakistan east to China and south to Indonesia). The southern and eastern native range limits extend to saltwater, leaving unresolved the species' climatic tolerances in those areas. The northern and western limits are associated with cold and aridity respectively. We plotted mean monthly rainfall against mean monthly temperature for the 149 native range weather stations to identify the climate conditions inhabited by pythons in their native range, and mapped areas of the coterminous United States with the same climate today and projected for the year 2100. We accounted for both dry-season aestivation and winter hibernation (under two scenarios of hibernation duration). The potential distribution was relatively insensitive to choice of scenario for hibernation duration. US areas climatically matched at present ranged up the coasts and across the south from Delaware to Oregon, and included most of California, Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and South and North Carolina. By the year 2100, projected areas of potential suitable climate extend northward beyond the current limit to include parts of the states of Washington, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York. Thus a substantial portion of the mainland US is potentially vulnerable to this ostensibly tropical invader.																	1387-3547					FEB	2009	11	2					241	252		10.1007/s10530-008-9228-z								WOS:000262490100008

The habitat and conduit functions of roads in the spread of three invasive plant species	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Nonnative plant species commonly occur along roadsides, and populations are often assumed to invade by spread along the road axis. To distinguish between the function of roadsides as movement corridors and as habitat, nonnative plant species were surveyed along roads in deciduous forest sites in southeastern Ohio, USA. The importance of road proximity was tested by comparing nonnative species abundance in 100 m transects along roads with transects in undisturbed forest. Nonnative species were most abundant and most frequently observed in roadside sites in valleys. Three common species were chosen for closer scrutiny. In a seed sowing experiment roads and open sites proved to be better locations for the germination and growth of Microstegium vimineum than non-roadside and closed-canopy sites. Tussilago farfara and Rosa multiflora occurred in a small number of disjunct patches suggesting infrequent arrival in the sampled transects. Both species were strongly clustered at scales consistent with diffusive spread by vegetative growth and short-range seed dispersal. Comparisons of distributions parallel and perpendicular to roads showed no evidence for enhanced dispersal along the road axis. Microstegium distributions were correlated with local light availability implying site saturation. Microstegium micro-distributions suggested that spread along the road axis was facilitated by movement of dormant seeds in road maintenance. Thus, roadsides appear to function as both habitat and a conduit for population expansion, with the rate of spread dependent on the life history of the individual species. These results suggest a hierarchical process of regional invasion, with different dispersal mechanisms functioning at different spatial scales.																	1387-3547					FEB	2009	11	2					453	465		10.1007/s10530-008-9262-x								WOS:000262490100028

The seasonality of reproduction in photoperiod responsive and nonresponsive northern red-backed voles (Myodes rutilus) in Alaska	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE												High-latitude arvicoline rodents usually reproduce in warmer months, but winter breeding has been documented in several species, including the northern red-backed vole (Myodes rutilus (Pallas, 1779) Wilson and Reader, 2005; formerly Clethrionomys rutilus (Pallas, 1779)). We tested whether the reproductive condition of the species is linked to changes in environmental parameters or its body condition, and we tested the frequencies at which different reproductive phenotypes are exhibited under field and laboratory conditions. Free-living voles in south-central Alaska reached peak reproductive organ masses in spring (females) and early summer (males). Between-subject comparisons showed an effect of body mass, photoperiod, percent fat, temperature, and snow depth on reproductive organ masses, depending on the sex and breeding period (p < 0.05). One instance of late-summer photoperiod nonresponsiveness was observed, but we detected no winter breeding. Captive male voles given food ad libitum and housed at room temperature exhibited strong phenotypic variation in testis mass in response to short photoperiods. The percentage of nonresponders was 28.2% and was within the known range of nonresponsiveness for lower latitude species (20%-40%). Thus, photoperiod nonresponsive morphs are conserved in at least one arctic and subarctic species at frequencies comparable to lower latitude voles despite no observance of winter breeding in the field. Voles exhibit reproductive elasticity and may breed in winter if environmental conditions enable them.																	0008-4301					FEB	2009	87	2					152	164		10.1139/Z08-147								WOS:000263641800006

Inferring National and Regional Declines of Rare Orchid Species with Probabilistic Models	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												Fragmentation of natural habitats can increase numbers of rare species. Conservation of rare species requires experts and resources, which may be lacking for many species. In the absence of regular surveys and expert knowledge, historical sighting records can provide data on the distribution of a species. Numerous models have been developed recently to make inferences regarding the threat status of a taxon on the basis of variation in trends of sightings over time. We applied 5 such models to national and regional (county) data on 3 red-listed orchid species (Cephalanthera longifolia, Hammarbya paludosa, and Pseudorchis albida) and 1 species that has recently come to the attention of conservation authorities (Neotinea maculata) in the Republic of Ireland. In addition, we used an optimal linear estimate to calculate the time of extinction for each species overall and within each county. To account for bias in recording effort over time, we used rarefaction analysis. On the basis of sighting records, we inferred that these species are not threatened with extinction and, although there have been declines, there is no clear geographical pattern of decline in any species. Most counties where these orchid species occurred had a low number of sightings; hence, we were cautious in our interpretation of output from statistical models. We suggest the main drivers of decline in these species in Ireland are modification of habitats for increased agricultural production and lack of appropriate management. Our results show that the application of probabilistic models can be used even when sighting data are scarce, provided multiple models are used simultaneously and rarefaction is used to account for bias in recording effort among species over time. These models could be used frequently when making an initial conservation assessment of species in a region, particularly if there is a relatively constant recording rate and some knowledge of the underlying recording process. Regional-scale analyses, such as ours, complement World Conservation Union criteria for assessment of the extinct category and are useful for highlighting areas of under recording and focusing conservation efforts of rare and endangered species.

In this study, a model describing the temperature-dependent thresholds for swarming activity and temperature requirement for development from egg to adult was driven by transient regional climate scenario data for Sweden, covering the period of 1961-2100 for three future climate change scenarios (SRES A2, A1B and B2). During the 20th century, the weather supported the production of one bark beetle generation per year, except in the north-western mountainous parts of Sweden where the climate conditions were too harsh. A warmer climate may sustain a viable population also in the mountainous part; however, the distributional range of I. typographus may be restricted by the migration speed of Norway spruce. Modelling suggests that an earlier timing of spring swarming and fulfilled development of the first generation will significantly increase the frequency of summer swarming. Model calculations suggest that the spruce bark beetle will be able to initiate a second generation in South Sweden during 50% of the years around the mid century. By the end of the century, when temperatures during the bark beetle activity period are projected to have increased by 2.4-3.8 degrees C, a second generation will be initiated in South Sweden in 63-81% of the years. The corresponding figures are 16-33% for Mid Sweden, and 1-6% for North Sweden. During the next decades, one to two generations per year are predicted in response to temperature, and the northern distribution limit for the second generation will vary. Our study addresses questions applicable to sustainable forest management, suggesting that adequate countermeasures require monitoring of regional differences in timing of swarming and development of I. typographus, and planning of control operations during summer periods with large populations of bark beetles.																	1354-1013					FEB	2009	15	2					486	499		10.1111/j.1365-2486.2008.01742.x								WOS:000262510500016

A study of glutathione-dependent enzymes in grasshopper nymphs	INSECT SCIENCE												Glutathione contents and activity of glutathione-dependent enzymes in the body of insects inhabiting polluted areas depend on toxin kind, concentration and exposure time. Enzymatic response may be modified by gender, age, developmental stage and state of nutrition. Also, chronic exposure to metals in the environment may cause the selection of individuals resistant to some environmental toxins. To assess the degree of adaptation of Chorthippus brunneus to metal-polluted habitats, we measured glutathione contents and the activity of selected glutathione-dependent enzymes in the offspring of aging mothers which differed in time and intensity of exposure to metals in their habitats. We tested whether differences represent temporal shifts in tolerance range or were genetically preserved and inherited by future generations. We investigated insects from three populations. Two live in heavily metal-burdened areas, exposed to metals for 170 (Szopienice) or 50 years (Olkusz) and the third inhabits an unpolluted reference site (Pilica). The most important findings were age-by-site interactions for all biochemical analyses. Nymphs from Szopienice had lower glutathione contents and lower glutathione-dependent enzyme activity in comparison with nymphs from the reference site. This was especially distinct in nymphs hatched from eggs laid by young females. The offspring of aging females from Olkusz, in terms of glutathione contents and glutathione reductase activities, revealed similar patterns to those from the reference site. For the remaining parameters, enzyme activity patterns in nymphs from Olkusz were similar to those of nymphs from Szopienice.																	1672-9609	1744-7917				FEB	2009	16	1					33	42		10.1111/j.1744-7917.2009.00251.x								WOS:000263246700004

Assessing larval rootworm behaviour after contacting maize roots: impact of germplasm, rootworm species and diapause status	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY												Current methods of screening maize (Zea mays L.) germplasm for susceptibility or resistance to corn rootworms (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) rely primarily on information from large-scale field experiments. Due to labour and cost constraints associated with field trials, alternative evaluation methods are desirable. We used a previously developed behavioural bioassay to: (1) investigate the host search behaviour of rootworm larvae after contact with 14 maize genotypes, (2) compare the behaviour of non-diapausing Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte, diapausing D. v. virgifera, and diapausing D. barberi Smith & Lawrence and (3) determine if this technique can be used to separate susceptible vs. resistant maize genotypes. The majority of rootworm larvae engaged in intensive (local search) behaviour after exposure to maize roots, whereas larvae continued to exhibit extensive (ranging) behaviour after contact with negative controls. Even though a transgenic hybrid with resistance to D. v. virgifera was included in analyses, quantitative path measurements were similar among genotypes and only differed between specific maize lines and controls. Notably, there were differences in host search behaviour among rootworm groups, with non-diapausing D. v. virgifera having more convoluted paths and engaging in intensive search more frequently than diapausing rootworms. Correlations between larval path measurements and historic root damage ratings were not significant, although there were weak positive correlations between historic adult emergence densities and measures of path linearity. However, due to the lack of significant behavioural differences among maize lines with a range of susceptibility levels, we concluded that this bioassay is not useful in screening maize germplasm for rootworm resistance.

J	Mollenbeck, V; Hermann, G; Fartmann, T				Moellenbeck, Verena; Hermann, Gabriel; Fartmann, Thomas			Does prescribed burning mean a threat to the rare satyrine butterfly Hipparchia fagi? Larval-habitat preferences give the answer	JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION												The ecological effects of fire management, especially regarding arthropods are poorly investigated. Burning in winter was assumed to pose a threat to butterfly species hibernating as larvae. To assess the impact of prescribed burning on population viability, we analysed larval-habitat preferences of the highly endangered, xero-thermophilous butterfly Hipparchia fagi in vineyards of the Kaiserstuhl region (southern Germany). Microhabitat preference analyses for mature larvae and egg-laying females revealed a preference of H. fagi for Bromus erectus-dominated communities with sparse vegetation coverage and a distinct tuft growth of the host plant B. erectus on microclimatically benefited slopes. We explain the preference of B. erectus by a preference of vegetation structure. The grass tufts offer a suitable climatically buffered living space for larvae. Egg deposition took place on dry substrate at positions of high solar radiation, thus adapted to hot and dry microclimate. As the larval habitat was sparsely vegetated as well as generally legally protected, fire management was not applicable and therefore not affecting the populations. We think it is conceivable that H. fagi, occurring here at its northern range limit, might expand its larval habitat into denser, combustible B. erectus stands in the course of global warming. A change in habitat preferences would necessitate a re-evaluation of management options.																	1366-638X					FEB	2009	13	1					77	87		10.1007/s10841-007-9128-z								WOS:000262125000008

Our work provides complementary, yet distinct, evidence that mutations in FVE/MSI4 have highly pleiotropic effects on plant architecture and organ production and growth, indicating an overall role in reprogramming the genome. First, this is illustrated by the fact that fve mutants and transgenic versions of the gene show no morphological aberrations while living, on average, twice as long and producing more biomass and seeds than the wild type. For example, depending on the photoperiod, the vegetative biomass in the mutants is increased three- to eightfold. FVE/MSI4 can therefore be considered a multifactor component of biomass and yield. Second, the gene functions primarily at the shoot apical meristem, acting to calibrate its overall cell proliferation activity and organ initiation. At the same time, FVE/MSI4 regulates cell growth during organ formation mainly by modulating the timing of proliferation-differentiation transition and that of endoreduplication. FVE/MSI4 is an accelerator of ontogenesis. The function of the gene is to scale-down meristem activities, while accelerating developmental transitions and cellular differentiation. Genes of the kind are ideal tools in biotech for engineering biomass and yield according to geographical or climate constraints. The results enhance our understanding on the role epigenetic components of the genome, such as FVE/MSI4, play in adaptation and biomass calibration. They also illustrate the kind of functional characterization biotech applications might require during the first steps of product development.																	1380-3743					FEB	2009	23	2					239	257		10.1007/s11032-008-9229-8								WOS:000262125600006						
J	Friberg, M; Wiklund, C				Friberg, Magne; Wiklund, Christer			Host plant preference and performance of the sibling species of butterflies Leptidea sinapis and Leptidea reali: a test of the trade-off hypothesis for food specialisation	OECOLOGIA												A large proportion of phytophagous insect species are specialised on one or a few host plants, and female host plant preference is predicted to be tightly linked to high larval survival and performance on the preferred plant(s). Specialisation is likely favoured by selection under stable circumstances, since different host plant species are likely to differ in suitability-a pattern usually explained by the "trade-off hypothesis", which posits that increased performance on a given plant comes at a cost of decreased performance on other plants. Host plant specialisation is also ascribed an important role in host shift speciation, where different incipient species specialise on different host plants. Hence, it is important to determine the role of host plants when studying species divergence and niche partitioning between closely related species, such as the butterfly species pair Leptidea sinapis and Leptidea reali. In Sweden, Leptidea sinapis is a habitat generalist, appearing in both forests and meadows, whereas Leptidea reali is specialised on meadows. Here, we study the female preference and larval survival and performance in terms of growth rate, pupal weight and development time on the seven most-utilised host plants. Both species showed similar host plant rank orders, and larvae survived and performed equally well on most plants with the exceptions of two rarely utilised forest plants. We therefore conclude that differences in preference or performance on plants from the two habitats do not drive, or maintain, niche separation, and we argue that the results of this study do not support the trade-off hypothesis for host plant specialisation, since the host plant generalist Leptidea sinapis survived and performed as well on the most preferred meadow host plant Lathyrus pratensis as did Leptidea reali although the generalist species also includes other plants in its host range.																	0029-8549					FEB	2009	159	1					127	137		10.1007/s00442-008-1206-8								WOS:000262576700012	19002503

Michael			Survival from Hypoxia in C-elegans by Inactivation of Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetases	SCIENCE												Hypoxia is important in a wide range of biological processes, such as animal hibernation and cell survival, and is particularly relevant in many diseases. The sensitivity of cells and organisms to hypoxic injury varies widely, but the molecular basis for this variation is incompletely understood. Using forward genetic screens in Caenorhabditis elegans, we isolated a hypoxia- resistant reduction- of- function mutant of rrt- 1 that encodes an arginyl- transfer RNA ( tRNA) synthetase, an enzyme essential for protein translation. Knockdown of rrt- 1, and of most other genes encoding aminoacyl- tRNA synthetases, rescued animals from hypoxia- induced death, and the level of hypoxia resistance was inversely correlated with translation rate. The unfolded protein response was induced by hypoxia and was required for the hypoxia resistance of the reduction- of- function mutant of rrt- 1. Thus, translational suppression produces hypoxia resistance, in part by reducing unfolded protein toxicity.																	0036-8075					JAN 30	2009	323	5914					630	633		10.1126/science.1166175								WOS:000262862800042	19179530

Despite the fact that many bats are also long-distant migrants, the importance of foraging habitats for sustaining migrant bats has to date received little attention. We analyzed habitat selection patterns in the migrant bat, Nathusius' pipistrelle Pipistrellus nathusii, in the southernmost part of its range (Iberian Peninsula), an area in which both mating and hibernation occur. We found that natural wetlands and riparian habitats (Phragmites reed beds) were positively selected, whereas human-transformed aquatic habitats (rice paddies) were avoided. Although semi-natural human-managed wetlands are perceived as being valuable for many species, our data emphasizes the importance of preserving natural wetlands (including riparian forests) as appropriate habitats for sustaining crucial phases of the life cycle of this bat. Agricultural transformation of the land is likely to be detrimental to this species since it reduces the availability of its preferred foraging habitat.

Urophora quadrifasciata produces up to three generations in Arkansas, rather than being bivoltine as in the northern United States of America. The first, second, and third generations of U. quadrifasciata reached peak adult numbers around 26 May, 29 June, and 27 July, respectively. Males tended to emerge earlier than females but the female:male ratio was approximately 1:1 for most of the season. The majority of the offspring of the three generations emerged between June and October, while approximately 38% entered diapause and emerged as adults in April-June of the following yearn 3.4 +/- 0.1 (mean +/- SE) (range 1-12) flies emerged from each infested capitulum. The absence of other, competing knapweed biological control agents as well as very low rates of: parasitism, mild weather conditions, and a long, er knapweed growing season likely contributed to the adaptation and establishment of U. quadrifasciata on spotted knapweed in Arkansas.

J	Davie, A; Minghetti, M; Migaud, H				Davie, Andrew; Minghetti, Matteo; Migaud, Herve			Seasonal Variations in Clock-Gene Expression in Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar)	CHRONOBIOLOGY INTERNATIONAL												In homeothermic vertebrates inhabiting temperate latitudes, it is clear that the seasonal changes in daylength are decoded by the master circadian clock, which through secondary messengers (like pineal melatonin secretion) entrains rhythmic physiology to local conditions. In contrast, the entrainment and neuroendocrine regulation of rhythmic physiology in temperate teleosts is not as clear, primarily due to the lack of understanding of the clock gene system in these species. In this study, we analyzed the diel expression of the clock-genes in brains of Atlantic salmon, a species that is both highly photoperiodic and displays robust clock-controlled behavior. Atlantic salmon parr were acclimated to either long-day (LD) or short-day (SD) photoperiods for one month and thereafter sampled at 4h intervals over a 24h cycle. Clock, Bmal1, Per2, and Cry2 were all actively expressed in salmon brain homogenates and, with the exception of Per2, all displayed rhythmic expression under SD photoperiods that parallels that reported in zebrafish. Interestingly, daylength significantly altered the mRNA expression of all clock genes studied, with Clock, Bmal1, and Per2 all becoming arrhythmic under the LD compared to SD photoperiod, while Cry2 expression was phase delayed under LD. It is thus proposed that the clock-gene system is actively expressed in Atlantic salmon, and, furthermore, as has been reported in homeothermic vertebrates, it appears that clock expression is daylength-dependent.

After 150 days of low temperature treatment (3-5 degrees C, 16L : 8D, r.h. 70-80%) more males than females died. The mortality rate ranged from 88.8 to 93.8% in males and from 54.2 to 60.7% in females. However, these sexual differences in mortality did not differ significantly across the three species and populations of different geographic origin. It remains a general question whether this considerable evolutionary stability in the sex-specific investment into reproduction and survival phylogenetically conserved or frequently evolves anew to similar levels in separated populations and species. In Nabis rugosus, the relative loss of body mass during overwintering was up to 37.8%. This reflects dramatic somatic costs of adult overwintering and indirectly supports the hypothesis that food supply during overwintering is important for some heteropteran predators. However, body mass before overwintering did not significantly explain the survival pattern in N. rugosus in either sex. The similar sex-specific survival rate of overwintering adult nabids regardless of species and geographic origin can be useful for studies on population dynamics of nabids in agroecosystems and biocontrol.																	1210-5759						2009	106	1					37	41		10.14411/eje.2009.005								WOS:000264479100005

Genetic and physiological variation among sexual and parthenogenetic populations of Asobara japonica (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), a larval parasitoid of drosophilid flies	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY												We studied variations in genetic, physiological, and ecological traits, and the phylogenetic relationship among sexual and parthenogenetic populations of Asobara japonica, a larval parasitoid of drosophilid flies, in order to understand how they adapt to local environments and have differentiated. The strain from Iriomote-jima (IR) differed from other Japanese strains in the nucleotide sequences of its cytochrome oxidase Subunit I (COI) and in not undergoing diapause and having a shorter preimaginal period and a higher adult tolerance of cold. The strains other than IR showed a low level of nucleotide variation in COI but varied in their mode of reproduction; the strains from the Ryukyu Islands were sexual, whereas those from the main islands of Japan and Ogasawara were parthenogenetic. In addition, strains from higher latitudes generally showed a high incidence of diapause, although there were some exceptions. On the other hand, preimaginal period and adult cold tolerance varied little among the strains excluding IR, and pupal cold tolerance, oviposition preference and incidence of parasitism varied little among the strains including IR. Evolution and environmental adaptations in this species are discussed, particularly focusing on parthenogenetic populations.																	1802-8829						2009	106	2					171	178		10.14411/eje.2009.020								WOS:000265937900003

Microgeographic life history variation in an alpine caddisfly: plasticity in response to seasonal time constraints	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Temporally constrained environments, such as habitats with short growth seasons or short hydroperiods, cause potentially strong selection on life histories. Depending on the predictability of these events and the extent of spatial and temporal heterogeneity, local populations could become adapted either via a fixed phenotype or via life history plasticity in response to these environmental cues. 2. We used a common garden experiment to investigate microgeographic variation in life history responses to combined changes in photoperiod (ambient/late) and hydroperiod (constant/drying) time constraint cues in an alpine caddisfly (Trichoptera). We compared six populations (three permanent/three temporary streams) originating from a small, alpine floodplain and which spanned an expected gradient in growth period duration (GPD) with distance from glaciers. 3. We made two main predictions in relation to locally varying selection pressures: (i) populations nearest glaciers (shorter GPD and strongest time constraints) should have the fastest development rates and (ii) populations from permanent streams should be less able to respond to drying hydroperiods than populations from temporary streams. 4. All populations and both sexes accelerated development in response to late season photoperiod cues. However, only permanent stream populations showed an increase in development time with increasing GPD, suggesting that other factors were influencing populations in temporary streams. 5. Permanent stream populations showed countergradient variation (genetic and environmental influences were in opposition) in development time, and under-compensation of growth rates resulted in a converse Bergmann cline in body size (smaller body size along gradients of declining season length). The extent of plasticity in response to hydroperiod, and the combined effects of both time constraints, differed between populations and sexes, but were not consistent among populations. 6. Taken together, our results suggest adaptive plasticity in response to season length. The lack of a predictable pattern in response to hydroperiod may be due to gene flow or weak selection. We conclude that spatially structured populations can strongly differ in phenotypic plasticity even at microgeographic scales.

Adult males (n = 20) and females (n = 15) were surgically implanted with radio-transmitters and tracked every 48 h during the active season (April through October) for three consecutive years (2001 to 2003). From late autumn to early spring (November through March), when snakes were hibernating and thus inactive, tracking was reduced to once per week. We generated data On movement and other spatial parameters for each subject rising GPS coordinates. There were significant sex differences in activity range size and multiple movement parameters. Throughout the active season males had greater activity range sizes and showed greater movement than females. This trend was pronounced during the mating season, which was restricted to late summer and early fall (late July through September). In contrast to most populations of A. contortrix from more southern and western localities, we did not observe any sexual activity (e.g., courtship, coitus, and male-male fighting) in the spring. Individuals of both sexes showed annual fidelity to: W activity range location, (ii) activity, range size, (iii) movement distances, (iv) particular features of their activity ranges (e.g., refuge sites), and (v) hibernation sites. Males and females showed no difference in preferred seasonal I habitats. I n both sexes, shifts in habitat associations (hiring the active season included migrations from over-wintering sites within basalt trap rockslides to upper-elevation, open deciduous forest during the summer foraging and reproductive season. Parturition in the field was recorded in eight instances and was always close to one of the two hibernacula used by the individuals in the study area.

Time course of changes in Gambel's white-crowned sparrow song behavior following transitions in breeding condition	HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR												Seasonal changes in behavior and in its underlying neural substrate are common across animal taxa. These changes are often triggered by steroid sex hormones. Song in seasonally breeding songbirds provides an excellent example of this phenomenon. In these species, dramatic seasonal changes mediated by testosterone and its metabolites occur in adult song behavior and in the neural circuitry controlling song. While song rate can quickly change in response to seasonal breeding cues, it is unknown how quickly other aspects of song change, particularly the stereotypy of song phonology and syntax. In this study we determined whether and how quickly song rate, phonology, and syntax change in response to breeding and non-breeding physiological cues. We asked these questions using Gambel's white-crowned sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophrys gambelii), a closed-ended learner with well-characterized changes in the neural circuitry controlling song behavior. We exposed ten photosensitive sparrows to long-day photoperiod and implanted them with subcutaneous testosterone pellets (day 0) to simulate breeding conditions. We continuously recorded song and found that song rate increased quickly, reaching maximum around day 6. The stereotypy of song phonology changed more slowly, reaching maximum by day 10 or later. Song syntax changed minimally after day 6, the earliest time point examined. After 21 days, we transitioned five birds from breeding to non-breeding condition. Song rate declined precipitously. These results suggest that while song rate changes quickly, song phonology changes more slowly, generally following or in parallel with previously investigated changes in the neural substrate.

Small amounts of sealed brood were observed to be continuously present in colonies throughout the winter. Enough brood was reared during the winter to produce a small but temporary increase in the adult bee population and to replace most of the adults that died during the winter. Requeened colonies produced slightly more sealed brood during winter than colonies that had retained their original package queen. Approximately 34 - 50% of the adults in colonies in March had been reared during the winter. In March, the average adult colony was composed of workers that ranged from a few days old to 192 days of age. Average spring adult populations were 13,274 +/- 1,078 (range 5,000 to 20,746).																	0021-8839						2009	48	2					85	90		10.3896/IBRA.1.48.2.01								WOS:000265703400001

Clock genes are proposed as regulatory factors in forming dopamine-related behaviors and mood and melatonin has the ability to regulate these processes. Melatonin-mediated changes in clock gene expression have been reported in brain regions, including the striatum, that are crucial for the development of dopaminergic behaviors and mood. However, it is not known whether melatonin receptors present in striatum mediate these effects. Therefore, we investigated the role of the melatonin/melatonin receptor system on clock gene expression using a model of primary neuronal cultures prepared from striatum. We found that melatonin at the receptor affinity range (i.e., nm) affects the expression of the clock genes mPer1, mClock, mBmal1 and mNPAS2 (neuronal PAS domain protein 2) differentially in a pertussis toxin-sensitive manner: a decrease in Per1 and Clock, an increase in NPAS2 and no change in Bmal1 expression. Furthermore, mutating MT1 melatonin receptor (i.e., MT1 knockouts, MT1(-/-)) reversed melatonin-induced changes, indicating the involvement of MT1 receptor in the regulatory action of melatonin on neuronal clock gene expression. Therefore, by controlling clock gene expression we propose melatonin receptors (i.e., MT1) as novel therapeutic targets for the pathobiologies of dopamine-related behaviors and mood.

Activity, habitat use, density, and reproductive biology of the crab-eating fox (Cerdocyon thous) and comparison with the pampas fox (Lycalopex gymnocercus) in a Restinga area in the southern Brazilian Atlantic Forest	MAMMALIAN BIOLOGY												The ecology and reproductive biology of the crab-eating fox (Cerdocyon thous) and the pampas fox (Lycalopex gymnocercus) were studied in Itapua State Park, an Atlantic Forest fragment. In this study we describe their activity patterns (diet, lunar, and seasonal), reproductive period, density, spatial distribution, and habitat overlap. The crab-eating fox was more abundant than the pampas fox, occurring in all types of habitats and overlapping with the pampas fox only in the southern portion of the study area, covered by open vegetation. Both canid species presented nocturnal habits and C. thous showed no significant differences in activity among lunar phases or else year season. The density of C. thous was estimated to be 0.78 ind/km(2). The crab-eating fox reproduced once a year, generating pups during spring (October to December). In comparison with C thous populations from lower-latitude regions the relatively low density and one reproductive event per year that we observed are probably related to a colder climate, shorter photoperiod, and shortage of food resources in the winter, characteristic of southern Brazil.

J	Susilo, ES; Harnadi, L; Takemura, A				Susilo, Endang Sri; Harnadi, Lilik; Takemura, Akihiro			Tropical monsoon environments and the reproductive cycle of the orange-spotted spinefoot Siganus guttatus	MARINE BIOLOGY RESEARCH												Negligible fluctuation in water temperature and photoperiod may cause fish species in tropical environments to utilize additional environmental factors to initiate reproductive activities during suitable periods of the year. We examined periodic changes in ovarian development of orange-spotted spinefoot (Siganus guttatus) in coral reefs off Karimunjawa Archipelago, Indonesia, and compared them with changes in regional environmental factors. The gonadosomatic index of this species increased initially during March-May and again during September-November. Concomitant with the increase, yolk-laden oocytes were observed (histologically) in ovaries, suggesting that the ovary develops twice a year. Initiation of reproductive activities was consistent with transition periods between rainy and dry seasons, suggesting that environmental cues linked to tropical monsoons influence reproductive activity. This suggestion is inconsistent with previous findings for the same species, but in higher latitudes, that the initiation of reproductive activity was influenced by increases in photoperiod and water temperature. It was observed that spinefoot exhibit plasticity in the use of environmental factors within habitats. Synchronized spawning occurred twice during the reproductive season, and was repeated between the new and first quarter of the lunar cycle. This periodicity was consistent with the spawning rhythm in other regions, suggesting that this species may perceive cues from the moon to synchronize spawning.

J	Bapary, MAJ; Fainuulelei, P; Takemura, A				Bapary, Mohammad Abu Jafor; Fainuulelei, Pouvave; Takemura, Akihiro			Environmental control of gonadal development in the tropical damselfish Chrysiptera cyanea	MARINE BIOLOGY RESEARCH												Photoperiod and temperature are potent environmental factors regulating the reproductive cycle of temperate fish. It is unclear whether fish in the tropics utilize these environmental factors for initiation and termination of their reproductive activity. The aim of this study was to examine the involvement of photoperiod and temperature in ovarian development of sapphire devil, Chrysiptera cyanea, which is a reef-associated tropical damselfish. Monthly collections of individuals in the experimental region (26 degrees 42'N, 127 degrees 52'E) revealed an increase in the gonadosomatic index (GSI) and appearance of vitellogenic oocytes in ovaries from March to August. Post-ovulated follicles and yolk-laden oocytes coexisted in some ovaries from May to August. These results suggest that the sapphire devil in this region has a restricted reproductive season with repeated spawnings. Rearing the fish during the resting phase (December) under experimental conditions of a long photoperiod (LD 14:10) at 31 degrees C for 15 days and at 25 or 31 degrees C for 60 days resulted in a significant increase in GSI and induction of vitellogenic oocytes, whereas a short photoperiod (LD 10:14) at the same temperatures failed to induce oocytes at the yolk stages. Long-term rearing of the fish at 31 degrees C caused regression of vitellogenic oocytes. During the reproductive season, the fish reared at 25 degrees C had higher spawning frequency than those at 20 and 30 degrees C. It is concluded that photoperiod and temperature are involved in the regulation of gonadal development and a long photoperiod within a suitable range of water temperatures is required for continuity of reproductive activities.

Shortened duration of the annual Neocalanus plumchrus biomass peak in the Northeast Pacific	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The calanoid copepod Neocalan us plumchrus (Marukawa) is a dominant member of the spring mesozooplankton in the subarctic North Pacific and Bering Sea. Previous studies have shown interdecadal and latitudinal variation in seasonal developmental timing, with peak biomass occurring earlier in years and places with warmer upper ocean temperatures. Because N. plumchrus normally has a single dominant annual cohort, its seasonal timing can be indexed from measurements of total population biomass or by following progressive changes in stage composition. Early studies empirically found that peak upper ocean biomass occurred when about half of the pre-dormant population had reached copepodite stage 5 (C5). However, more recent comparisons derived from recent Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) data now show peak biomass when a larger fraction (> 80%) of the population is at C5. CPR samples the surface 10 to 15 m, but comparisons to depth-resolved BIONESS data show that this discrepancy is not an artefact of sampling depth. Other causes are either a prolongation of duration of pre-dormant C5 or a narrowing of the age range making up the annual cohort. We assessed changes in cohort width using a modification of Greve's cumulative percentile method, and found that average cohort widths in the Alaska Gyre were significantly narrower in 2000-2007 than in 1957-1965 (1968-1980 were intermediate). Net tow sampling of Strait of Georgia populations showed a similar significant narrowing of cohorts in the 2003-2005 sampling period. This study provides evidence that in addition to the shift to an earlier occurrence of peak biomass reported previously, the duration of the peak has also decreased in the last decade.																	0171-8630						2009	393						189	198		10.3354/meps08044								WOS:000272187800016

This sector includes circumpolar zones and fronts with distinct hydrographic and trophic regimes, such as the Subtropical Zone (STZ), Subtropical Frontal Zone (STFZ), Subantarctic Zone (SAZ), Polar Frontal Zone (PFZ), North Subtropical Front (NSTF), Agulhas Retroflection Front (ARF), South Subtropical Front (SSTF), Subantarctic Front, Surface Polar Front (SPF), and Subsurface Polar Front. Seasonal variations in the solar irradiance and day length, stratification, lack of micronutrients like iron and increased grazing pressure are the major factors that influenced or constrained biological production in this region. Even though broad differences in these controlling factors exist in time and space between the zonal regions, the upper 1000 m of the water column of the main zones, STZ, STFZ, SAZ, PFZ, supported almost identical standing stocks of mesozooplankton, 0.43, 0.47, 0.45 and 0.49 ml m(-3), respectively, during the austral summer. This unexpected similarity can be explained either through the functioning of the microbial loop within STZ, STFZ and SAZ and the multivorous food web ecology within the PFZ. Dominance of ciliates in the microzooplankton community may be one factor resulting in the maintenance of a high mesozooplankton standing stock in SAZ. In contrast to the zones, frontal regions showed wide differences in hydrography and biological characteristics. The SSTF and SPF were far more biologically productive than that of NSTF and ARF.																	0171-8630						2009	389						97	116		10.3354/meps08126								WOS:000270673100008						
J	Masojc, P; Milczarski, P				Masojc, Piotr; Milczarski, Pawel			Relationship between QTLs for preharvest sprouting and alpha-amylase activity in rye grain	MOLECULAR BREEDING												Preharvest sprouting (PHS) and high alpha-amylase activity ( AA) negatively affect quality of rye grain. The objective of this study was to reveal genetic relationship between PHS and AA by developing a consensus map of QTLs controlling each trait. A method of composite interval mapping (CIM) was used to search for QTLs within the 541 9 Ot1-3 and DS2 x RXL10 F(2) mapping populations representing wide variation range of both traits. Sixteen QTLs for AA were detected on chromosomes 1R ( 3), 2R ( 2), 3R ( 2), 4R ( 3), 5R ( 3), 6R ( 2) and 7R ( 1). Their distribution was not random showing a tendency of QTL location in distal regions of chromosomes. Nine QTLs for AA located on chromosome arms 1RS, 2RL, 3RS, 4RL, 5RS, 5RL, 6RS, 6RL and 7RS coincided with QTLs for PHS. Seven QTLs for AA independent from PHS were detected on chromosome arms 1RL ( 2), 2RS, 3RL, 4RS, 4RL and 5RL. Four QTLs for PHS not associated with those for AA were identified on chromosomes 1RL, 2RL, 5RL and 7RL. Partial overlapping of the genetic systems controlling AA and PHS suggests that alpha-amylase found in sound grain of rye could be produced through at least three independent mechanisms i.e. PHS at its initial stage, late maturity alpha-amylase (LMA) and/or retained pericarp alpha-amylase (RPAA). Six QTLs co-located on both maps were found on chromosome arms 1RS, 2RS, 5RS, 5RL, 6RS and 6RL. Valuable features of line Ot1-3 i.e. resistance to preharvest sprouting and low alpha-amylase production in ripening grain can be attributed to seven major QTLs from chromosomes 1RL, 2RL, 5RL ( 2), 6RL and 7R ( 2). This set of QTLs, identified in line Ot1-3, might be useful in breeding sprouting resistant cultivars of rye.

Unique biological rhythm in the reproductive behaviour of female ticks of reptiles	PARASITOLOGY												We report the discovery of a biological rhythm in the reproductive behaviour of the tick Bothriocroton hydrosauri that was absent in Amblyomma limbalum, it species that occurs on the same species of reptile host. Female B. hydrosauri mated in autumn or winter delayed oviposition until the following spring, while there was no diapause in conspecific females inated in spring or early summer, Initiation of ovipositional diapause in ticks is usually related to photoperiodic stimuli, but this was not the case for B. hydrosauri. The sinusoidal pattern in pre-oviposition times of B. hydrosauri females mated in different months in the laboratory Suggests an internal seasonal time-keeping mechanism. We hypothesize that hormones imbibed by females during their bloodmeal may provide environmental cues associated with the induction of diapause. Irrespective of the mechanism underlying the rhythm, diapause by B. hydrosauri females mated during autumn or winter is of adaptive advantage because it synchronizes oviposition with favourable environmental conditions for egg hatching and increases the chance of larvae finding a host. The lack of a similar biological rhythm in A. limbatum may be a reflection of the different environmental conditions this species experiences throughout most of its range as compared with B. hydrosauri.

Because of the dense road network the hedgehog is in Western Europe one of the species most affected by road kills. In North-African countries and particularly in Algeria, both the road network and the number of cars have considerably increased in the last decades. Thus, the number of Algerian Hedgehogs (Atelerix algirus) victims of the traffic is high and regular. Along a road of ca 100 km with high traffic volume, localized in the Soummam valley (front Bejaia to Bouira), we recorded during 5 years (from 2002 to 2006) the number, places and dates of hedgehogs found killed. The road was surveyed from a car, three times a week, and the overall number of hedgehogs found killed was 459. The distribution of animals respective to their location showed a very high density in suburban areas with their diverse environmental structures such as forests, agricultural areas, hedges, and the woodlands around the wadi El Soummam tributaries. In the course of the year, the hedgehog road kills were maximal in spring and summer (42.92 and 34.64% respectively), decreasing in autumn and reaching a minimum in winter (5.66%). It was possible to determine the age and sex of 404 animals. Every year males were observed first in spring from March onwards. During this period more males than females were found dead (45.30% and 3 1.19% respectively). The strong locomotor activity of males in spring (maximum in May) and summer coincides with the period of reproduction. Additionally, their home range is larger than that of females. Juveniles were found mostly at the end of summer and the beginning of autumn (23.51%). This period corresponds to dispersion and foraging for winter. At the end of autumn, the activity started to decrease and was further reduced in winter in order to save energy during the adverse times of the year. In this period it is likely that the animals reduce their metabolism and hibernate.

J	Spady, TJ; Harlow, HJ; Butterstein, G; Durrant, B				Spady, Thomas J.; Harlow, Henry J.; Butterstein, George; Durrant, Barbara			Leptin as a surrogate indicator of body fat in the American black bear	URSUS												We investigated the potential use of leptin as a wildlife management tool to monitor adiposity in American black bears (Ursus americanus). Body mass (BM), body condition index (BCI), serum leptin concentration, and percent of body fat were measured in semi-free ranging (SFR) adult male (South Dakota, Oct 2003-Jun 2004) and free-ranging (FR) adult females (Colorado and Wyoming, 1997-99) in fall, winter, spring, and summer. These variables were analyzed by simple and multiple linear regression models to determine their relative value as predictors of body fat proportion over a wide range of adiposity (7.5-48% of total BM). Log-transformed serum leptin concentration (in leptin) was the most consistent single surrogate predictor of percent body fat when compared with BM and BCI. For both SFR and FR cohorts, In leptin was strongly predictive of percent body fat within the range of adiposity between 7.5-35%. Moreover, the best predictors of body fat were multiple regression models that included In leptin in both SFR males (AIC(c) = 75.97, omega = 0.61) and FR females (AIC(c) = 85.07, omega = 0.54). Therefore, serum leptin markedly improves the resolution and accuracy of common field estimates of body condition in black bears. Because it is strongly associated with and predictive of bioelectrical impedance assay (BIA) estimation of body fat, further investigation of serum leptin as a predictor of adiposity is warranted.																	1537-6176						2009	20	2					120	130		10.2192/08GR025.1								WOS:000272691400007

The blue light receptor CRY2 regulates photoperiodic flowering in the experimental model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. However, it is unclear whether genetic variations affecting cryptochrome activity or expression is broadly associated with latitudinal distribution of plants. We report here an investigation of the function and expression of two cryptochromes in soybean, GmCRY1a and GmCRY2a. Soybean is a short-day (SD) crop commonly cultivated according to the photoperiodic sensitivity of cultivars. Both cultivated soybean (Glycine max) and its wild relative (G. soja) exhibit a strong latitudinal cline in photoperiodic flowering. Similar to their Arabidopsis counterparts, both GmCRY1a and GmCRY2a affected blue light inhibition of cell elongation, but only GmCRY2a underwent blue light- and 26S proteasome-dependent degradation. However, in contrast to Arabidopsis cryptochromes, soybean GmCRY1a, but not GmCRY2a, exhibited a strong activity promoting floral initiation, and the level of protein expression of GmCRY1a, but not GmCRY2a, oscillated with a circadian rhythm that has different phase characteristics in different photoperiods. Consistent with the hypothesis that GmCRY1a is a major regulator of photoperiodic flowering in soybean, the photoperiod-dependent circadian rhythmic expression of the GmCRY1a protein correlates with photoperiodic flowering and latitudinal distribution of soybean cultivars. We propose that genes affecting protein expression of the GmCRY1a protein play an important role in determining latitudinal distribution of soybeans.																	0027-8424					DEC 30	2008	105	52					21028	21033		10.1073/pnas.0810585105								WOS:000262092800082	19106300

A latitudinal cline in the Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) Clock gene: evidence for selection on PolyQ length variants	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												A critical seasonal event for anadromous Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) is the time at which adults migrate from the ocean to breed in freshwater. We investigated whether allelic variation at the circadian rhythm genes, OtsClock1a and OtsClock1b, underlies genetic control of migration timing among 42 populations in North America. We identified eight length variants of the functionally important polyglutamine repeat motif (PolyQ) of OtsClock1b while OtsClock1a PolyQ was highly conserved. We found evidence of a latitudinal cline in average allele length and frequency of the two most common OtsClock1b alleles. The shorter 335 bp allele increases in frequency with decreasing latitude while the longer 359 bp allele increases in frequency at higher latitudes. Comparison to 13 microsatellite loci showed that 335 and 359 bp deviate significantly from neutral expectations. Furthermore, a hierarchical gene diversity analysis based on OtsClock1b PolyQ variation revealed that run timing explains 40.9 per cent of the overall genetic variance among populations. By contrast, an analysis based on 13 microsatellite loci showed that run timing explains only 13.2 per cent of the overall genetic variance. Our findings suggest that length polymorphisms in OtsClock1b PolyQ may be maintained by selection and reflect an adaptation to ecological factors correlated with latitude, such as the seasonally changing day length.																	0962-8452					DEC 22	2008	275	1653					2813	2821		10.1098/rspb.2008.0524								WOS:000260611200005	18713722

Development and demographic parameters of A. ceratoniae were Studied in a growth chamber at temperature of 30 +/- 1 degrees C, relative humidity of 75 +/- 5% and a photoperiod of 16:8 (L:D) oil fruits of pomegranate, pistachio, fig, and date. The results indicated that mean generation times were 42.38 +/- 0.47, 45.24 +/- 0.42, 57.83 +/- 1.19 and, 89.55 +/- 1.48 days on pomegranate, pistachio, fig and, date, respectively. The gross fecundity rate on pistachio was higher than those on three other diets. The net reproductive rate (r(m)) was calculated to be lowest on date (3.64 +/- 0.59) and highest oil pistachio (45.74 +/- 4.17). The net reproductive rates oil four diets differed significantly. The highest and lowest amounts of the intrinsic rate of increase were observed on pomegranate (0.107 +/- 0.013) and date (0.018 +/- 0.002), respectively. The r(m) values were significantly different among four diets. The highest estimated doubling time was 37.46 +/- 5.82 days on date.

Daily endocrine profiles in parr and smolt Atlantic salmon	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY A-MOLECULAR & INTEGRATIVE PHYSIOLOGY												To elucidate possible mechanisms behind the endocrine control of parr-smolt transformation, the daily plasma profiles in thyroid hormones (TH; free thyroxine (FT4), total thyroxine (TT4), and total 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (TT3)), growth hormone (GH) and cortisol were studied in Atlantic salmon parr and smolts under simulated-natural winter (8 L:16D) and spring (16.5 L:7.5D) photoperiods, respectively. Overall, TT4, TT3 and GH levels were higher in smolts than in part, whereas FT4 levels fluctuated within the same range in parr and smolts. Significant diurnal changes in plasma TH were present in parr. Both FT4 and TT4 levels increased during the photophase and decreased during the scotophase, while TT3 levels followed an inverse pattern. Growth hormone showed no significant changes in part. Changes in FT4, TT4, GH, and cortisol, but not TT3, levels, were observed in smolts with peak levels during both the photophase and scotophase for FT4, TT4 and GH. Plasma cortisol was not assayed in parr but in smolts the peaks were associated with dusk and dawn. In addition to the general increases in TH, GH and cortisol, the distinct endocrine differences in nighttime levels between part in the winter and smolts in the spring suggest different interactions between TH, GH, cortisol and melatonin at these different time points. These spring scotophase endocrine profiles may represent synergistic hormone interactions that promote smolt development, similar to the synergistic endocrine interactions shown to accelerate anuran metamorphosis. The variations in these diurnal rhythms between parr and smolts may represent part of the endocrine mechanism for the translation of seasonal information during salmon smoltification.

DISCORDANT LONGITUDINAL CLINES IN FLOWERING TIME AND PHYTOCHROME C IN ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA	EVOLUTION												Using seasonal cues to time reproduction appropriately is crucial for many organisms. Plants in particular often use photoperiod to signal the time to transition to flowering. Because seasonality varies latitudinally, adaptation to local climate is expected to result in corresponding clines in photoperiod-related traits. By experimentally manipulating photoperiod cues and measuring the flowering responses and photoperiod plasticity of 138 Eurasian accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana, we detected strong longitudinal but not latitudinal clines in flowering responses. The presence of longitudinal clines suggests that critical photoperiod cues vary among populations occurring at similar latitudes. Haplotypes at PHYC, a locus hypothesized to play a role in adaptation to light cues, were also longitudinally differentiated. Controlling for neutral population structure revealed that PHYC haplotype influenced flowering time; however, the distribution of PHYC haplotypes occurred in the opposite direction to the phenotypic cline, suggesting that loci other than PHYC are responsible for the longitudinal pattern in photoperiod response. Our results provide previously missing empirical support for the importance of PHYC in mediating photoperiod sensitivity in natural populations of A. thaliana. However, they also suggest that other loci and epistatic interactions likely play a role in the determination of flowering time and that the environmental factors influencing photoperiod in plants vary longitudinally as well as latitudinally.

Little is known about this flightless and endangered beetle, apart from its distribution range and habitat stenotopy. We present the results of a 2-year mark-release-recapture study on two neighbouring populations in Germany, which investigated basic parameters of population ecology that may be influential in the persistence of the beetle. Extremely small population sizes were the key findings. Since population densities corresponded to those of typical Carabus species, the size of the habitats was most probably the limiting factor. The risk of heavy losses during offspring development and hibernation may be alleviated by the considerable proportion of C. variolosus reproducing in more than 1 year. The fact that we did not recapture any marked specimens from the neighbouring population suggests a very limited dispersal power. The results imply a high vulnerability of the species, provide basic methodological information for an implementation of the EC Directive and for further research, and highlight the necessity to enlarge populated habitats.

J	Moriyama, M; Numata, H				Moriyama, Minoru; Numata, Hideharu			Diapause and prolonged development in the embryo and their ecological significance in two cicadas, Cryptotympana facialis and Graptopsaltria nigrofuscata	JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY												The seasonal timing mechanism of egg hatching was examined in two cicadas, Cryptotympana facialis and Graptopsaltria nigrofuscata, with different but overlapping geographical distributions. These species lay eggs in summer, and nymphs hatch in the summer of the following year after egg durations of 10-12 months. When eggs were maintained at 25 degrees C from oviposition, both the species entered embryonic diapause within 60 days irrespective of photoperiod, but at different developmental stages between the two species. The optimal temperature for diapause development was approximately 15 degrees C in both the species. The development rate for postdiapause morphogenesis increased linearly with temperature in the range of 20-27.5 degrees C in C. facialis, and of 15-25 degrees C in G. nigrofuscata. The lower development threshold and the sum of effective temperatures were computed as 14.3 degrees C and 715.3 day-degrees in C. facialis and 12.1 degrees C and 566.6 day-degrees in G. nigrofuscata, respectively. The hatching dates predicted by these large thermal constants accorded with the hatching dates observed in the field, i.e., late June and mid-July in G. nigrofuscata and C. facialis, respectively. Therefore, the high thermal requirements for postdiapause development compel the cicadas to hatch in summer. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Estrada-Pena, A				Estrada-Pena, Agustin			Climate, niche, ticks, and models: what they are and how we should interpret them	PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH												Ticks spend most of their life cycle in the environment, and all tick life cycle stages are dependent on a complex combination of climate variables. Furthermore, host availability and vegetation significantly modulate the dynamics of tick populations. Tick recruitment is dependent oil successful reproduction, which in turn requires sufficient adult tick densities, available blood meal sources, and egg survival. Though many animals can serve as hosts, there are several determinants of host suitability. For example, host availability in time and space is an important determinant of tick bionomics. Shelter and protection from environmental extremes are critical to tick survival. Questing and diapausing ticks are vulnerable to extremes of temperature and humidity. There are concerns about]low predicted climate change may alter several critical features of host-parasite relationships of ticks, the potential for invasion of new areas or alteration of patterns of pathogen transmission in particular. However, modeling approaches that relate known occurrences of tick species to climate (and/or landscape) features and predict geographic occurrences are not completely fulfilling our needs to understand how the "tick panorama" can change as a consequence of these climate trends. This is a short review about the concept of ecological niche as applied to ticks, as well as some raised concerns about its evaluation and strict definition, and its usefulness to map geographical suitability for ticks. Comments about how climate, hosts, and landscape configuration are briefly discussed regarding its applicability to tick mapping and with reference about their impact on tick abundance. I will further comment on already published observations about observed changes in the geographical range of ticks in parts of Europe.

J	Musolin, DL; Ito, K				Musolin, Dmitry L.; Ito, Kiyomitsu			Photoperiodic and temperature control of nymphal development and induction of reproductive diapause in two predatory Orius bugs: interspecific and geographic differences	PHYSIOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												The effects of day-length and temperature on pre-adult growth and induction of reproductive diapause are studied in Orius sauteri and Orius minutus (Heteroptera: Anthocoridae) from northern (43.0 degrees N, 141.4 degrees E) and central (36.1 degrees N, 140.1 degrees E) Japan. In the north, at 20 degrees C, pre-adult growth is slower under an LD 14 : 10 h photoperiod than under shorter or longer photophases. At 24 and 28 degrees C, the longer photophases result in shorter pre-adult periods. Acceleration of nymphal growth by short days in autumn appears to be adaptive. In the central region, this response is less pronounced, suggesting that timing of adult emergence is less critical than in the north. Day length also influences the thermal requirements for pre-adult development. The slope of the regression line representing temperature dependence of pre-adult development is significantly smaller and the lower development threshold (LDT) is significantly lower under an LD 12 : 12 h photoperiod than under long-day conditions. The weaker dependence of nymphal growth on temperature and the lower LDT in autumn might be adaptive. In the north, increased temperature shifts the critical day length of diapause induction and suppresses the photoperiodic response in O. sauteri but not in O. minutus. Further south, the incidence of diapause in both species is low even under short-day conditions but the same interspecific difference is observed (i.e. increase of temperature affects the response in O. sauteri but not in O. minutus). This suggests seasonally earlier diapause induction with weaker temperature dependence in O. minutus than in O. sauteri.

Evidence is presented indicating that this beetle has two diapauses that appear to synchronize this long life cycle with the seasons. Larvae exposed to 20, 22.5, 25 and 27.5 degrees C late in the third (last) stadium pupate rapidly except for some individuals kept at the highest temperature. The latter pupate upon transfer to 22.5 degrees C, indicating that larval diapause is maintained at high temperature but terminates upon transfer to a lower temperature. Pupal development is directly temperature-dependent in the range 20-30 degrees C. Adults develop reproductive organs (i.e. the ovary in females and the seminal vesicles and accessory glands in males) rapidly at 15 and 20 degrees C, whereas those kept at 25 degrees C take a long time to do so. Ovarian development is completely suppressed at 30 degrees C but initiated upon transfer to 20 degrees C. In the laboratory, males with well-developed reproductive organs mate even with sexually immature females, whereas females with undeveloped ovaries show no sexual behaviour. Although the two diapauses of this species are thermally regulated (i.e. a characteristic commonly expressed by insects in summer diapause), adults of this beetle emerge from pupae late in the autumn and remain in the soil for 2 months. Adult diapause effectively serves to synchronize the time of sexual maturation with the coldest month of the year.																	0307-6962					DEC	2008	33	4					334	345		10.1111/j.1365-3032.2008.00640.x								WOS:000261105700007

The balance between both mites took place week Is after the release. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of N. californicus density to be released in apple orchards for the control of the red mite. A commercial orchard in Fraiburgo (SC) was chosen and populations of 50,000, 100,000 and 150,000 phytoseiidae per ha were released. These populations were from the commercial breeding centre located at Renar Macas, in Fraiburgo. The damage, due to the feeding of P. ulmi was measured in terms of the range of brownish symptoms. The monitoring of hibernating eggs was carried Out in May, July and September. The treatment with 150,000 phytoseiidae reduced the Population of red mite 16 days after the release, while the other treatments required three weeks. The damage to the leaves was less in the treatment with 150,000 phytoseiidae. The monitoring of hibernating eggs using 50,000 and 100,000 phytoseiids/plot took place in May and it was 75% and 69% greater than in the plot using 150,000 phytoseiidae. It can be concluded that the release of 150,000 N. californicus was more efficient in the control of P ulmi in the reproductive phenological stage of the apple tree.

No adult animals dispersed from the area during the study period and home ranges tended to be used for several years, probably for life. The average annual home-range size, calculated using 95% fixed kernel, was 382.2 ha +/- 297.4 SD for females (N = 30 seasonal home ranges) and 352.4 ha +/- 313.3 for males (N = 32 seasonal home ranges). Paired raccoon dogs had home ranges of similar size (P = 0.203), with pairs sharing the same area all year round (P < 0.001). Raccoon dogs occupied large core areas (85% kernel) covering 81.2% of their home ranges. The home ranges were at their smallest during the mating season. The slightly larger size of home ranges in winter suggests that, due to the temperate climate, raccoon dogs do not hibernate in Germany. Males and females formed a long-term (probably lifelong) pair bond. Same-sex neighbours ignored each other and even adjacent males/females showed neither preference nor avoidance. Thus, based on the results of home-range overlap analysis and interaction estimations, it can be assumed that the raccoon dog in Central Europe is monogamous without exclusive territories.																	0909-6396					DEC	2008	14	4					457	466		10.2981/0909-6396-14.4.457								WOS:000263353700006

In this study, we investigated the influences of parental geographic origin, host plant, and rearing density on the diapause incidence of progeny in this beetle. In studies conducted at 25 degrees C and L12:D12 photoperiod, the proportions of adults entering diapause were significantly different among latitudes from which the parents had been collected. The incidence of diapause increased with increasing latitude. Reciprocal cross tests between post-diapause adults from different latitudes showed that there were significant differences in diapause incidence between pure-bred and hybrid adults, suggesting that diapause incidence among progeny was determined by both the female and male, although the female appeared to have a stronger effect than the male. These results revealed that parental origin has an important influence on progeny diapause. Parental host plant species not only affected diapause incidence of the current generation, but also affected the incidence of diapause in the progeny produced by the non-diapause parents; yet, the parental host plant had no influence on the incidence of diapause in the progeny produced by the post-diapause parents. Rearing density of the parental generation had no significant effect on the incidence of diapause in the progeny.																	0013-8703					NOV	2008	129	2					117	123		10.1111/j.1570-7458.2008.00749.x								WOS:000260009400001

Divergent timing of egg-laying may maintain life history polymorphism in potentially multivoltine insects in seasonal environments	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY												The length of the favourable season determines voltinism in insect populations. In some insects, there is variation in fecundity and timing of reproduction among females. If the length of the favourable season does not allow all offspring to develop into adults without diapause, the benefits of high early fecundity may outweigh the associated cost of low lifetime fecundity. We tested this by exploring mating frequencies of Pieris napi females along a latitudinal gradient in different generations. Pieris napi is a bivoltine butterfly, and genetically polyandrous females enjoy higher lifetime fecundity than monandrous ones. Polyandry is, however, coupled with a relatively low early fecundity. We found that monandrous females are more likely to produce an additional generation than polyandrous ones under conditions that allow production of only a partial summer generation. Monandrous females were also the first to emerge and slightly over-represented in the summer generation under conditions that allow the development of a complete summer generation. Further, a stochastic model shows that variation in the timing of reproduction between strategies is sufficient to explain the observed patterns. Thus, seasonality may counter-select against polyandry, or more generally against low early reproductive rate, and promote maintenance of polymorphism in life history strategies.

Little is known about the underlying evolutionary genetic architecture of diapause in any organism. Drosophila melanogaster exhibits a reproductive diapause that is variable within and among populations; the incidence of diapause increases with more temperate climates and has significant pleiotropic effects on a number of life history traits. Using quantitative trait mapping, we identified the RNA-binding protein encoding gene couch potato (cpo) as a major genetic locus determining diapause phenotype in D. melanogaster and independently confirmed this ability to impact diapause expression through genetic complementation mapping. By sequencing this gene in samples from natural populations we demonstrated through linkage association that variation for the diapause phenotype is caused by a single Lys/Ile substitution in one of the six cpo transcripts. Complementation analyses confirmed that the identified amino acid variants are functionally distinct with respect to diapause expression, and the polymorphism also shows geographic variation that closely mirrors the known latitudinal cline in diapause incidence. Our results suggest that a naturally occurring amino acid polymorphism results in the variable expression of a diapause syndrome that is associated with the seasonal persistence of this model organism in temperate habitats.

Control of discontinuous gas exchange in Samia cynthia: effects of atmospheric oxygen, carbon dioxide and moisture	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY												The evolution of discontinuous gas exchange (DGE) in insects is highly controversial. Adaptive hypotheses which have obtained experimental support include a water savings mechanism for living in dry environments (hygric hypothesis), a reduction in oxidative damage due to a high-performance oxygen delivery system (oxidative damage hypothesis), and the need for steep intratracheal partial pressure gradients to exchange gases under the hypercapnic and/or hypoxic conditions potentially encountered in subterranean environments (chthonic hypothesis). However, few experimental studies have simultaneously assessed multiple competing hypotheses within a strong inference framework. Here, we present such a study at the species level for a diapausing moth pupa, Samia cynthia. Switching gas conditions from controlled normoxic, normocapnic and intermediate humidity to either high or low oxygen, high or low moisture, elevated carbon dioxide, or some combination of these, revealed that DGE was abandoned under all conditions except high oxygen, and high or low gas moisture levels. Thus, support is found for the oxidative damage hypothesis when scored as maintenance of DGE. Modulation of DGE under either dry or hyperoxic conditions suggested strong support for the oxidative damage hypothesis and some limited support for the hygric hypothesis. Therefore, this study demonstrates that the DGE can be maintained and modulated in response to several environmental variables. Further investigation is required using a strong-inference, experimental approach across a range of species from different habitats to determine how widespread the support for the oxidative damage hypothesis might be.

Natural History Studies for the Preliminary Evaluation of Larinus filiformis (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) as a Prospective Biological Control Agent of Yellow Starthistle	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												We studied the life history, geographic distribution, behavior, and ecology of Larinus filiformis Petri (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) in its native range to determine whether it is worthy of further evaluation as a classical biological control agent of yellow starthistle, Centaurea solstitialis (Asteraceae: Cardueae). Larinus filiformis occurs in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkey, adults were well has been reared only from C. sobditiatis. At field sites it) central and eastern Turkey, adults were well synchronized with the plant, being active from mid-May to late July, and ovipositing ill capitula (flowerheads) of C. solstitialis from mid-june to Larvae destroy all the seeds ill a capitulum. The insect is univoltine in Turkey, and addults hibernate from mid-September to mid-May. In the spring, before adults begin ovipositing, they feed on the immature flower buds of C. solstitialis, causing them to die. The weevil destroyed 25-7.5% of capitula at natural field sites, depending on the sample date. Preliminary host specificity experiments oil adult feeding indicate that the weevil seems to be restricted to a relatively small number of plants within the Cardueae. Approximately 57% of larvae or pupae collected late in the summer were parasitized by hymenopterans [Bracon urinator, B. tshitssherini (Braconidae) and Exeristes roborator (Ichneumonidae), Aprostocetus sp. (Eulophidae), and unidentified species of Eurytomidae and Ormyridae]. This weevil may be a better choice than the other capitula insects already established in the United States, particularly in colder parts of the plant's range.																	0046-225X	1938-2936				OCT	2008	37	5					1185	1199		10.1603/0046-225X(2008)37[1185:NHSFTP]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000260097100017	19036197

The larvae feeding on pine trees with different damage levels were studied to determine the induction of diapause under both laboratory and field conditions. Developmental duration of larvae before the third instar was the longest when fed with 75%-90% damaged needles, followed by 25%-40% damaged needles and intact pine needles, whereas mortalities did not differ among different treatments under the conditions of 25 degrees C and critical photoperiod 13.5:10.5 L:D. At 25 degrees C, no diapause was induced under 15:9 L:D, whereas 100% diapause occurred under 12:12 L:D regardless of the levels of needle damage. Incidences of larvae entering diapause when they were fed with intact, 25%-40% and 75%-90% damaged pine needles were 51.7%, 70.8% and 81% under 13.5:10.5 L:D, respectively. Similar results were obtained in the field experiment. Incidence of diapause was significantly different among the pine needle damage levels of pine trees when the photoperiod was close to the critical day length, indicating that the effect of host plants on diapause induction was dependent on the range of photoperiod. The content of amino acid and sugar decreased and tannin increased in pine needles after feeding by the pine caterpillars, suggesting that changed levels of nutrients in damaged needles or a particular substance emitted by damaged pine trees was perhaps involved in the diapause induction of the pine caterpillar.																	1672-9609					OCT	2008	15	5					441	445		10.1111/j.1744-7917.2008.00231.x								WOS:000259610800007

Here we apply these tools to an extensive set of barley accessions to identify a component of the molecular basis of the flowering time adaptation, a trait critical to plant survival. Using an association-based study to relate variation in flowering time to sequence-based polymorphisms in the Ppd-H1 gene, we identify a causative polymorphism (SNP48) that accounts for the observed variation in barley flowering time. This polymorphism also shows latitude-dependent geographical distribution, consistent with the expected clinal variation in phenotype with the nonresponsive form predominating in the north. Networks, genealogies, and phylogenetic trees drawn for the Ppd-H1 phenotypes reveal population structure both in wild barley and in domesticated barley landraces. The spatial distribution of these population groups indicates that phylogeographical analysis of European landraces can provide information relevant to the Neolithic spread of barley cultivation and also has implications for the origins of domesticated barley, including those with the nonresponsive ppd-H1 phenotype. Haplotypes containing the nonresponsive version of SNP48 are present in wild barley accessions, indicating that the nonresponsive phenotype of European landraces originated in wild barley. The wild accessions whose nonresponsive haplotypes are most closely similar to those of landraces are found in Iran, within a region suggested as an area for domestication of barley east of the Fertile Crescent but which has previously been thought to have contributed relatively little to the diversity of European cultivars.

J	Kramer, A; Sarnelle, O				Kramer, Andrew; Sarnelle, Orlando			Limits to genetic bottlenecks and founder events imposed by the Allee effect	OECOLOGIA												The Allee effect can result in a negative population growth rate at low population density. Consequently, populations below a minimum (critical) density are unlikely to persist. A lower limit on population size should constrain the loss of genetic variability due to genetic drift during population bottlenecks or founder events. We explored this phenomenon by modeling changes in genetic variability and differentiation during simulated bottlenecks of the alpine copepod, Hesperodiaptomus shoshone. Lake surveys, whole-lake re-introduction experiments and model calculations all indicate that H. shoshone should be unlikely to establish or persist at densities less than 0.5-5 individuals m(-3). We estimated the corresponding range in minimum effective population size using the distribution of habitat (lake) sizes in nature and used these values to model the expected heterozygosity, allelic richness and genetic differentiation resulting from population bottlenecks. We found that during realistic bottlenecks or founder events, > 90% of H. shoshone populations in the Sierra Nevada may be resistant to significant changes in heterozygosity or genetic distance, and 70-75% of populations may lose < 10% of allelic richness. We suggest that ecological constraints on minimum population size be considered when using genetic markers to estimate historical population dynamics.

Although the molecular mechanisms of flowering regulation have been extensively characterized in a number of plant species, little is known regarding how the transition process initiates. Here, we show that the Rice Indeterminate 1 (RID 1) gene acts as the master switch for the transition from the vegetative to reproductive phase. RID1 encodes a Cys-2/His-2-type zinc finger transcription factor that does not have an ortholog in Arabidopsis spp. A RID1 knockout(rid1), mutated by T-DNA insertion, never headed after growing for >500 days under a range of growth conditions and is thus referred to as a never-flowering phenotype. This mutation-suppressed expression of the genes is known to be involved in flowering regulation, especially in the Ehd1/Hd3a pathway and a series of RFT homologs. RID1 seems to be independent of the circadian clock. A model was proposed to place RID1 in the molecular pathways of flowering regulation in rice, for which there are two indispensable elements. In the first, RID1 is controlling the phase transition and initiation of floral induction. In the other, the Hd3a/RFL1/FTL complex acts as the immediate inducer of flowering. Loss of function in either element would cause never-flowering. Once the phase transition is induced with the activation of RID1, flowering signal is transduced and regulated through the various pathways and eventually integrated with FT-like proteins to induce flowering.																	0027-8424					SEP 2	2008	105	35					12915	12920		10.1073/pnas.0806019105								WOS:000259343000054	18725639					
J	Tanaka, S; Zhu, DH				Tanaka, Seiji; Zhu, Dao-Hong			Geographic variation in embryonic diapause, cold-hardiness and life cycles in the migratory locust Locusta migratoria (Orthoptera : Acrididae) in China	ENTOMOLOGICAL SCIENCE												To investigate geographic adaptation of the migratory locust Locusta migratoria in China, locusts were collected from six localities, ranging from 47.4 degrees N to 19.2 degrees N. Using offspring from the various populations, we compared embryonic diapause, reproductive traits, cold-hardiness and adult body size. The incidence of embryonic diapause was influenced by the genetic makeup, parental photoperiod, and incubation temperature of the eggs. The northern strain (47.4 degrees N) produced diapause eggs under all photoperiodic conditions, whereas the other strains produced a higher proportion of diapause eggs when exposed to a short photoperiod. The incubation temperature greatly influenced diapause induction. At a low temperature, all eggs entered diapause, even some of those from a tropical strain (19.2 degrees N) in which no diapause was induced at high temperatures. Photoperiodic changes during the parental generation affected the incidence of embryonic diapause. Diapause intensity decreased with decreasing original latitude. Cold hardiness was compared by exposing eggs in diapause to either -10 or -20 degrees C for various periods; the northern strain was more cold-hardy than the southern strain, although some eggs in the tropical strain were probably not in a state of diapause. Adult body size and head width showed a complicated pattern of variation along the latitudinal gradient, whereas egg pod size (egg pod width and egg number) and hatchling weight tended to decrease with decreasing latitude. These results reveal that L. migratoria has adapted to local environments and that the latitudinal gradient appears to play an important role in shaping L. migratoria life cycle and development.																	1343-8786					SEP	2008	11	3					327	339		10.1111/j.1479-8298.2008.00284.x								WOS:000259374900007

Pyrethroid pesticides have been detected in water and fluvial sediments in this watershed, creating concerns about potential negative impacts on water quality. However, little documentation exists regarding the distributions or the extent of the adverse effects caused by the use of pyrethroids. This study developed a geographic information systems (GIS) model to identify areas with high potential for pyrethroid runoff during the rainy season. The model was then validated using field-monitoring data. Nine factors were identified for the runoff risk assessment: amount of active ingredient used, soil erodibility factor, hydrologic group, surface layer depth, seasonal rainfall, seasonal number of rainy days, seasonal number of storm events, stream density, and land cover. The results indicated that high pyrethroid runoff risks were associated with basins such as the Stanislaus River Sub-basin, Newman Gustine Sub-basin and South Merced Sub-basin. This study demonstrated that the GIS model is capable of predicting high-risk areas of pyrethroid runoff at sub-basin scale. The model can be used to prioritize sites for water quality monitoring and guide implementations of best management practices.																	0943-0105					SEP	2008	55	6					1195	1206		10.1007/s00254-007-1065-3								WOS:000258673500005

Precise models for the phenology of different species are essential for predicting the potential effects of any temporal mismatch of life cycles with environmental parameters under different climate change scenarios. Here we investigated the effects of ambient water temperature on the onset and synchrony of emergence for a widespread European riverine dragonfly, Gomphus vulgatissimus. 2. Long-term field data on the annual emergence from two rivers in northern Germany, and additional data from a laboratory experiment with different temperature regimes, were used to develop a model that predicted the onset of emergence by using mainly the temperature sum (degree days) as a parameter. 3. Model predictions of the onset of emergence fitted the observations well and could be transferred between localities. This was particularly so when weighting early winter temperature data by using a day length and a temperature-response function, implying potential additional control mechanisms for the onset of emergence. 4. We simulated effects of different winter temperature regimes on the emergence curves in order to predict the effects of climate change. These indicated an acceleration of emergence by 6-7 days per 1 degrees C temperature increase, which is corroborated by the laboratory data and is in the upper range of data published for other dragonflies.

Development and Evaluation of a New Predictive Model for Metamorphosis of Great Lakes Larval Sea Lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) Populations	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Accurate forecasts of the number of larval sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) within a stream that will enter into metamorphosis are critical to currently used methods for allocating lampricide treatments among streams in the Great Lakes basin. To improve our ability to predict metamorphosis we used a mark-recapture technique, involving the marking of individual larval lamprey with sequentially coded wire tags, to combine information regarding individual and stream level parameters collected in year t, with direct observations of metamorphic outcome of lamprey recaptured in year t+1. We used these data to fit predictive models of metamorphosis. The best model demonstrated excellent predictive capabilities and highlighted the importance of weight, age, larval density, stream temperature and geographic location in determining when individual lamprey are likely to tran. form. While this model was informative, it required data whose measures are not practical to obtain routinely during the larval sea lamprey assessment program. A second model, limited to data inputs that can be easily obtained, was developed and included length of larvae the fall prior to metamorphosis, stream latitude and longitude, drainage area, average larval density in type-2 habitat, and stream lamprey production category (a measure of the regularity with which treatments are required). This model accurately predicted metamorphosis 20% more often than current models of metamorphosis; however, we recommend further validation on an independent set of streams before adoption by the Great Lakes Fishery Commission for ranking streams.

Time to adult eclosion ranged from 133 to 219 d for this generally univoltine, winter-developing species. Males experienced significantly shorter first, second, and third larval instars than females. Females spent significantly less time as fourth instars (whose endpoint is determined by photoperiod). Length of pupal stage was equal for males and females. Time to mean adult eclosion differed among treeholes but was not determined by latitudinal position of treehole. Wing lengths were shorter for males than females in this sexually dimorphic species and also differed significantly among treeholes. Wing lengths were significantly correlated with total developmental time, but females spending more time in the fourth instar did not emerge as larger adults. In natural treeholes, resource utilization during rapid development by Ae. sierrensis males may limit the size and number of females produced from the same cohort if resources are limiting.

J	Reyes, M; Sauphanor, B				Reyes, Maritza; Sauphanor, Benoit			Resistance monitoring in codling moth: a need for standardization	PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE												BACKGROUND: A wide range of methods has been used for monitoring resistance in Cydia pomonella L. However, the results from specific tests are not always concordant and they generate doubts over the extent to which the data represent the field situation. Therefore, the variability in the expression of resistance mechanisms and in resistance ratios between developmental stages and their reliability in a field situation were studied. RESULTS: Neonate larvae showed the highest insecticide resistance, except to spinosad. Resistance ratios were from 2 to 9.5, depending on the insecticide and the strain tested, when compared with the susceptible strain. Spinosad exhibited the highest resistance ratio for diapausing larvae (4.4, 12.2 and 4.4 for Raz, Rdfb and RA strains, respectively). Enzymatic ratios were higher in adults than in neonates or diapausing larvae, and the highest enzymatic ratios were observed for mixed-function oxidases (7.3-36.7 for adults of resistant strains). CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity of different instars depends on the insecticides used, and there is a differential expression of resistance mechanisms between stages. For the population considered in this study, tests on neonates provided the most consistent results to the field situation, but adult response to chlorpyrifos-ethyl and azinphos-methyl in the laboratory was also consistent with the field results.

Effect of relative humidity on development, survival and reproduction of the predatory lacewing Dichochrysa prasina (Neuroptera : Chrysopidae)	BIOLOGICAL CONTROL												The effect of five constant relative humidity (RH) regimes (12%, 33%, 55%, 75% and 94%) on the preimaginal development and adult longevity and reproduction of Dichochrysa prasina Burmeister was studied at 26 +/- 1 degrees C and a photoperiod of 16:8 (LD) under laboratory conditions. For the experiments, larvae were fed individually on eggs of the flour moth Ephestia kuehniella (Zeller), whereas adults on a liquid diet consisting of water, yeast hydrolysate, sugar and honey. The experimental insects were maintained individually in sealed plastic containers with saturated water salt solutions at the base to control RH. Preimaginal developmental time from egg to adult for females and males was significantly shorter at 75% and 94% RHs than at other RHs in the range from 12% to 55%. Percentages of adult emergence were similar at all RHs tested and varied from 52.5% to 75.0%. Adult females that had no access to water and were maintained at 12%-75% RH lived on average less than two weeks and laid no eggs, whereas at 94% RH they lived longer and each laid on average 201 eggs. When the females had periodic access to a water source a significant increase in both longevity and egg production occurred and the estimated intrinsic rate of increase was high, irrespective of RH. These results could be useful for the mass-rearing of D. prasina and for better understanding its population dynamics under field conditions. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Asymmetrical thermal constraints on the parapatric species boundaries of two widespread generalist butterflies	ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												1. The sibling species Papilio glaucus and Papilio canadensis meet in a narrow hybrid zone believed to be maintained by temperature thresholds acting independently on both species. The present study tests if this assertion is true for the cold-adapted species, P. canadensis, which is presumed to be limited by the effect of high temperatures in late summer and/or autumn on pupal survival. 2. Three experiments were conducted examining the effects of: (i) short periods of high temperature stress in autumn, (ii) prolonged warm temperatures in autumn, and (iii) temperatures simulating warmer winters/longer springs upon the survival of P. canadensis and P. glaucus. 3. Results indicated that short periods of high temperatures did not induce the high C mortality rates required to be the key factor limiting the range of P canadensis. However, P canadensis did exhibit a considerably lower tolerance to high temperature extremes, prolonged warm temperatures in autumn, and conditions simulating shorter/warmer winters than P glaucus. 4. Differences in temperature tolerance throughout the pupal stage are likely to be a significant factor in maintaining the southern range limit of P. canadensis. Further warming as may occur during climate change, particularly in winter and spring, will likely affect the dynamics of southerly populations of P. canadensis.

The defoliating leaflet-roller Episimus utilis Zimmerman was selected as potential biocontrol agent of this invasive species. The objectives of this study were to determine development rate and survival of E. utilis at seven constant temperatures (10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 33, and 35 degrees C) and generate prediction maps of the number of generations per year this species may exhibit in the United States. The rate of development of E. utilis as a function of temperature was modeled using linear regression to estimate a lower development threshold of 9.6 degrees C and the degree-day requirement of 588. The Logan nonlinear regression model was used to estimate an upper developmental threshold of 33 degrees C. Cold tolerance of E. utilis was examined using all insect stages, and each stage was exposed to three constant temperatures (10, 5, 0 degrees C) for 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 d (or until all insects died). The pupal stage was the most cold tolerant with 100% mortality after 12 d at 0 degrees C. The pupal lethal times at 5 (Ltime(50) = 10 d, Ltime(90) = 28 d) and 0 degrees C (Ltime(50) = 5 d, Ltime(90) = 9 d) were used to generate isothermal lines to predict the number of generations of E. utilis (range, 0.5-9.8) across all Brazilian peppertree range in the United States. The potential for establishment of E. utilis and its probable distribution in the continental United States was examined.

J	Burmeier, S; Jensen, K				Burmeier, Sandra; Jensen, Kai			Is the endangered Apium repens (Jacq.) Lag. rare because of a narrow regeneration niche?	PLANT SPECIES BIOLOGY												The conservation of rare plant species is an important aspect of global biodiversity protection, but in many cases these species and the reasons why they are rare are poorly understood. The perennial umbellifer Apium repens is generally regarded to be a rare species all over its European range. We hypothesized that its rarity might be caused by a restricted regeneration niche, that is, highly specific requirements for sexual regeneration, low seed dispersal potential and low endurance capacity of seeds in the ground. We conducted several experimental investigations on its germination ecology, hydrochorous dispersal potential and soil seed bank properties. Apium repens showed high germination success under a variety of abiotic conditions. Either light or cold-wet stratification was necessary to stimulate germination. Seeds were able to float for more than 50 days when protected from precipitation, and soil seed bank sampling revealed that at least some seeds of A. repens were contained in soil depths of up to 10 cm. Overall, our findings do not support the hypothesis that the rarity of A. repens is caused by highly specific requirements for its sexual regeneration. Nonetheless, its germination ecology should be considered when designing conservation measures for this endangered species.

Climate change reduces reproductive success of an Arctic herbivore through trophic mismatch	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												In highly seasonal environments, offspring production by vertebrates is timed to coincide with the annual peak of resource availability. For herbivores, this resource peak is represented by the annual onset and progression of the plant growth season. As plant phenology advances in response to climatic warming, there is potential for development of a mismatch between the peak of resource demands by reproducing herbivores and the peak of resource availability. For migratory herbivores, such as caribou, development of a trophic mismatch is particularly likely because the timing of their seasonal migration to summer ranges, where calves are born, is cued by changes in day length, while onset of the plant-growing season on the same ranges is cued by local temperatures. Using data collected since 1993 on timing of calving by caribou and timing of plant growth in West Greenland, we document the consequences for reproductive success of a developing trophic mismatch between caribou and their forage plants. As mean spring temperatures at our study site have risen by more than 4 degrees C, caribou have not kept pace with advancement of the plant-growing season on their calving range. As a consequence, offspring mortality has risen and offspring production has dropped fourfold.

J	Lardies, MA; Bozinovic, F				Lardies, Marco A.; Bozinovic, Francisco			Genetic variation for plasticity in physiological and life-history traits among populations of an invasive species, the terrestrial isopod Porcellio laevis	EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH												Background: Evolutionary interpretations of life-history as well as physiological patterns require distinction between genotypic variations and environmentally induced phenotypic variation. Problem: We investigate the extent to which variation in life history and metabolism have an environmental or a genetic basin in an invasive species. Methods: We used the widely distributed isopod, Porcellio laevis, as a model. To examine the effects of latitudinal gradients in temperature and photoperiod on life-history and physiological traits, we studied three populations located along a latitudinal gradient. We performed two common garden experiments using 20 families from each population. Treatment were: (1) 12 degrees C. 12/12 h light/dark and (2) 20 degrees C, 14/10 h light/dark. Measurements of metabolic rate and life-history traits were performed on females from the F(1) generation. Conclusions: (1) Differences in life-history and metabolic traits among populations mimic the natural pattern of latitudinal variation in a cold environment, where offspring size and reproductive output increase towards higher latitudes and metabolic rate increases towards lower latitudes. (2) There is genetic variation for plasticity in response to the environment, which may be acted upon by natural selection. (3) Our results support the hypothesis that phenotypic plasticity itself is an adaptive response to environmental heterogeneity.

Extrinsic light : dark cycles, rather than endogenous circadian cycles, affect the photoperiodic counter in the pitcher-plant mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY A-NEUROETHOLOGY SENSORY NEURAL AND BEHAVIORAL PHYSIOLOGY												A wide diversity of organisms use photoperiod (daylength) as an environmental cue to anticipate the changing seasons and to time various life-history events such as dormancy and migration. Photoperiodic time measurement consists of two main components, (1) the photoperiodic timer that discriminates between long and short days, and (2) the photoperiodic counter that accumulates and stores information from the timer and then induces the phenotypic output. Herein, we use extended night treatments to show that light is necessary to accumulate photoperiodic information across the geographic range of the mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii and that the photoperiodic counter counts extrinsic (external) light:dark cycles and not endogenous (internal) circadian cycles.

J	Campos, WG				Campos, Wellington G.			Photoperiodism and seasonality in neotropical population of Plutella xylostella L. (Lepidoptera : Yponomeutidae)	NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY												Neotropical populations of the diamondback moth Plutella xylostella L. have seasonal cycles of growth and decrease, and moth migration plays a fundamental role in generating such population dynamics. Since the oscillation of these populations is predictable, photoperiod might operate as a signal that triggers the migratory behaviour of the insect. Migration in insects is usually preceded by reproductive diapause, a photoperiodic response that can be characterised by morphological, physiological and behavioural alterations that permit to discriminate between migratory and nonmigratory forms. In this study, I tested whether the pre-imaginal and reproductive development of P. xylostella from Minas Gerais (Brazil) is affected by artificial day-lengths that are equivalent to the periods of natural population growth or decrease. No evidence of photoperiodic response was found for the insect reared in laboratory on five different constant photoperiods, from 8h to 16h of light per day. There was no significant variation in survival and duration of egg, larva, and pupa stages or in pupal weight, adult size (forewing length), fecundity, and longevity. Although some species have geographically distinct photoperiodic responses, previous assumptions that cosmopolitan P. xylostella responds to photoperiod in temperate regions was questioned. Migratory and population seasonality among neotropical populations of P. xylostella certainly occurs independently of the photoperiodic announcement of seasonal changes in habitat quality.

J	Nygren, GH; Bergstrom, A; Nylin, S				Nygren, Georg H.; Bergstrom, Anders; Nylin, Soren			Latitudinal body size clines in the butterfly Polyommatus icarus are shaped by gene-environment interactions	JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE												The study of latitudinal body size clines can illuminate processes of local adaptation, but there is a need for an increased understanding of the relative roles of genetic variation, environmental effects, and interactions between them, in shaping such geographical patterns. For this reason, we combined an investigation of a museum collection of the common blue butterfly Polyommatus icarus (Rottemburg) (Lycaenidae: Polyommatini) from Sweden with a common-garden experiment in the laboratory, using strains reared from individuals collected from three different latitudes. Sizes of the field-collected butterflies tended to smoothly decrease northwards in a latitudinal cline, but suddenly increase at the latitude where the life cycle changes from two to one generations per year, hence allowing more time for this single generation. Further north, the size of the field-collected butterflies again decreased with latitude (with the exception of the northernmost collection sites). This is in accordance with the "converse Bergmann" pattern and with the "saw-tooth model" suggesting that insect size is shaped by season length and number of generations along latitudinal transects. In contrast, under laboratory conditions with a constant long day-length there was a different pattern, with the butterflies pupating at a higher mass when individuals originated from southern populations under time stress to achieve a second generation. This is indirect evidence for field patterns being shaped by end-of-season cues cutting development short, and also suggests counter-gradient variation, as butterflies from the time-stressed populations over-compensated for decreasing larval development time by increasing their growth rates, thus obtaining higher mass. Hence, we found support for both adaptive phenotypic plasticity and local genetic adaptation, with gene-environment interactions explaining the observed field patterns.

Effect of temperature on the development, fecundity, progeny sex ratio and life-table of Campoletis chlorideae, an endolarval parasitoid of the pod borer, Helicoverpa armigera	BIOCONTROL												Development, survival, fecundity, progeny sex ratio (PSR) and age-specific life-table parameters of the parasitoid Campoletis chlorideae Uchida (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae) were examined at six different constant temperatures (12, 17, 22, 27, 32 and 37 degrees C) in the laboratory [70 +/- 10% RH and 10:14 h (light:dark) photoperiod]. Second instar larvae of Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) were reared on chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) and used as the host. Development times shortened as the temperature increased from 12 to 37 degrees C. The estimated lower developmental threshold (tL) was 3.4 degrees C. The thermal summation for total immature stages was 379.97 degree-days. A reciprocal relationship between temperature and longevity was observed in the range of 12-17C. The maximum mortality of pupae (71.8%) occurred at 37 degrees C. At 22 degrees C, the yield of a female parasitoid averaged 137.3 +/- 14.7 (mean +/- SD) progeny, of which 89.6 +/- 7.6 were daughters. The number of daughters produced decreased when the females were kept either above or below 22 degrees C, although the PSR was female biased in the range of 17-27 degrees C. The analyses of life-table parameters, developmental rates, reproduction, mortality and PSR suggest that maximum population growth (r(m) ) is near 27 degrees C. There was little variation observed in most of the desired qualities of C. chlorideae in the range of 17-27 degrees C, and it appears that the parasitoid is adapted to a wide range of temperatures. We suggest that for maximum production the parasitoid should be reared at 22 +/- 4 degrees C and be released in areas where the temperature ranges between 17 degrees and 27 degrees C, as in the plains of northern India.																	1386-6141	1573-8248				JUN	2008	53	3					461	471		10.1007/s10526-007-9083-3								WOS:000255189900004						
J	Ragland, GJ; Kingsolver, JG				Ragland, Gregory J.; Kingsolver, Joel G.			Evolution of thermotolerance in seasonal environments: The effects of annual temperature variation and life-history timing in Wyeomyia smithii	EVOLUTION												In organisms with complex life cycles, the adaptive value of thermotolerance depends on life-history timing and seasonal temperature profiles. We illustrate this concept by examining variation in annual thermal environments and thermal acclimation among four geographic populations of the pitcher plant mosquito. Only diapausing larvae experience winter, whereas both postdiapause and nondiapause adults occur only during the growing season. Thus, adults experience transient cold stress primarily during the spring. We show that adult cold tolerance (chill coma recovery) is enhanced in spring-like conditions via thermal acclimation but is unaffected by diapause state. Moreover, adult mosquitoes from northern populations were more cold tolerant than those from southern populations largely because acclimation responses were steeper in the north. In contrast to cold tolerance, there was no significant acclimation of heat tolerance (heat knockdown), and no significant differences in heat tolerance between northern and southern populations. Field temperature data show that because of evolved differences in diapause timing, adult exposure to cold stress is remarkably consistent across geography. This suggests that geographic variation in cold tolerance may not be the result of direct selection on adults. Our results illustrate the importance of the interplay between phenological and thermal adaptation for understanding variation along climatic gradients.																	0014-3820					JUN	2008	62	6					1345	1357		10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00367.x								WOS:000256356300006	18331458					
J	Curtis, JL; Baird, TA				Curtis, Jennifer L.; Baird, Troy A.			Within-population variation in free-living adult and ectoparasitic larval trombiculid mites on collared lizards	HERPETOLOGICA												We quantified within-population variation in the seasonal abundance of free-living adult trombiculid mites and infestation of collared lizards by parasitic mite larvae at the Arcadia Lake Dam in Edmond, OK, U.S.A. Lizards oil one of two habitat patches (front) harbored many more larval mites, and were more rapidly re-infested after mites were removed experimentally. Although female and male lizards and males displaying alternative social tactics had different activity rates, they harbored similar numbers of parasites, which is inconsistent with the hypothesis that the degree of ectoparasitism is positively related to host activity. Heavy mite infestation of front patch lizards was related to greater exposure to vegetation/soil surrounding this habitat patch, and perhaps more favorable physical conditions there for mite reproduction and development. The abundance of free-living adult mites on the rock substrata occupied by collared lizards was temporally dissociated from infestation of lizards by mite larvae. Free-living adult mites were abundant in May, but demand precipitously in June shortly after larvae began to appear oil lizards. Larval parasites remained until lizards entered hibernacula in late summer. There was no effect of marked differences ill larval mite load oil any of the behavioral, and most of the life-historical variables that we measured. The exception was growth rate. First-year males grow faster than all), of the other social classes in this population, and their rates were reduced oil the front habitat patch suggesting a growth cost of heavy parasitism at a time when lizards exhibit maximal growth.																	0018-0831					JUN	2008	64	2					189	199		10.1655/07-052.1								WOS:000257417000006

A study based on long-term breeding data, using the Colwell predictability model, showed that the start of the breeding season has a high predictability (approximate to 0.8-0.9) at all latitudes, and that the environmental information factor (I(e)) progressively decreased from mid Italy (I(e)>4) to northern Finland (I(e)<1). The results indicate that integration of supplementary information, such as ambient temperature, with photoperiodic initial predictive information (day length), becomes progressively more important in maintaining the predictability of the breeding season with decreasing latitude. This hypothesis was verified by exposing photosensitive Great Tits from northern Norway, southern Sweden and northern Italy to sub-maximal photo-stimulatory day lengths (13L:11D) under two different ambient temperature regimes (+4 degrees C and +20 degrees C). Changes in testicular size, plasma levels of LH and testosterone were measured. The main results were: (1) Initial testicular growth rate, as well as LH secretion, was affected by temperature in the Italian, but not in birds from the two Scandinavian populations. (2) Maximum testicular size, maximum LH and testosterone levels were maintained for a progressively shorter period of time with increasing latitude, regardless of whether the birds were kept on a low or a high ambient temperature. (3) In birds from all latitudes, the development of photorefractoriness, as indicated by testicular regression and a decrease in plasma levels of LH and testosterone, started much earlier (with the exception for LH Great Tits from northern Scandinavia) when kept on +20 degrees C than when kept on +4 degrees C. The prolonging effects of a low temperature was more pronounced in Mediterranean birds, than in birds from Scandinavia, and more pronounced in Great Tits from southern Scandinavia than in Great Tits from northern Scandinavia. Ecological implications of the results are discussed, as well as possible impact of global warming on the breeding success of European Great Tits from different breeding latitudes.

J	Martins, MJF; Vandekerkhove, J; Namiotko, T				Fernandes Martins, Maria Joao; Vandekerkhove, Jochen; Namiotko, Tadeusz			Environmental stability and the distribution of the sexes: insights from life history experiments with the geographic parthenogen Eucypris virens (Crustacea : Ostracoda)	OIKOS												In many species with mixed reproduction, parthenogens cover a wider geographic range than sexuals. In freshwater ostracods this pattern referred to as geographic parthenogenesis is traditionally explained by ascribing a higher potential for dispersal to parthenogens. For example, the postglacial invasion hypothesis states that the lack of males in northern Europe is caused by the relatively slow range expansion of sexual lineages after deglaciation. An alternative explanation for the contemporary distribution of the sexes is based on spatial and temporal variations in ecological habitat stability. To test this hypothesis, we compared life history data of Eucypris virens individuals originating from bisexual and all-female populations. Populations with males are only found around the Mediterranean, whereas parthenogens cover most of Europe. The animals were hatched and grown in environments mimicking temperature and photoperiod conditions observed in Belgium and Spain. The data confirm the higher potential for population growth in parthenogens. In particular their faster hatching response, possibly higher fecundity (as derived from a difference in body height) and the absence of a cost of males should allow them to out-compete sexuals under stable conditions. However, the comparison of the hatchling accumulation curves of bisexual and all-female populations suggests that sexuals have an advantage in highly unpredictable environments. Indeed, under conditions mimicking those in southern Europe, bisexual populations exhibit a bet-hedging strategy, while parthenogenetic resting eggs hatch on average earlier and more synchronously. Overall, the life history data stress the importance of short term environmental fluctuations for the distribution of the sexes in E virens, and probably many other inhabitants of ephemeral water bodies.

J	Ryzhanovskii, VN				Ryzhanovskii, V. N.			The role of photoperiodic conditions for Passeriformes inhabiting high-latitudinal areas	ZOOLOGICHESKY ZHURNAL												The results of field observations and experiments are discussed. At the latitude of the Northern Polar Circle in mid-winter the activity of passerines is recorded in morning twilight at illumination of 0.5-3 luxes. At the end of winter (winter solstice), the length of a foraging day does not exceed 5 h. This time is sufficient for a search of forage, therefore, the composition of passerines in winter is quite diverse. The high rates of daytime elongation in late winter stimulate the early beginning of sexual activity, which is inhibited by low temperature. Under conditions of polar day, migrating passerines need in additional light stimulation (24 light hours). The polar day limits the duration of reproductive functions of gonads to 1-1.5 months. In the Subarctics, the summer photoperiodic conditions influence the terms, duration, and completeness of postjuvenal molting of birds. Two groups of species were distinguished according to their response to the daytime length. One group consisted of Emberiza pusilla, E. schoeniclus. Luscinia svecica. and Parus cinctus - species. in which the completeness of molting changed related to an increase or reduction in the daytime length, and another group of species (Motacilla flava, M. alba, Anthus cervinus, A. pratensis, Philloscopus trochilus, Turdus pilaris, T. iliacus, and Calcarius lapponicus) that respond only to the reduction of daytime. The photoperiodic control of the beginning of postjuvenile molting was found in A. pratensis, T. iliacus, P. cinctits, Acanthis flammea, Plectrophenax nivalis. In M. flava, A. cervinus, L. svecica, Turdus pilaris, E. pusilla, E. schoeniclus, and C. lapponicus, the start of molting was not related to photoperiodic conditions. The period of molting in polar birds is short due to the early be-inning and high rates of plumage growth in polar days.																	0044-5134					JUN	2008	87	6					732	747										WOS:000257851300010

On status badges and quality signals in the paper wasp Polistes dominulus: body size, facial colour patterns and hierarchical rank	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												To establish a dominance order, social animals often rely on indicators of fighting to avoid costly aggressive encounters. In some species, individuals use colour patterns to signal their social status. Recent studies claimed that facial markings in the eusocial paper wasp Polistes dominulus are status badges that allow co-foundresses to form a linear hierarchy based on individual quality. Here, we evaluated facial patterns in natural populations of P. dominulus, in its native range, to observe whether the marks reflect overall wasp quality in different contexts. We used the same measures of clypeus patterns used by earlier studies, but did not find that they functioned as status badges. Our analyses showed no evidence that visual markers are related to: (i) size, (ii) probability of surviving winter, (iii) social rank in spring associations, or (iv) health status (assessed by the presence of strepsipteran endoparasites). Size, however, is important. Larger wasps are more likely to survive the winter and to acquire the dominant position in spring associations. Larvae infected with endoparasites become smaller adult wasps. These findings suggest that body size is a reliable quality indicator on which wasps build their social networks, and that clypeus patterning is not involved.

J	Zalamea, M; Gonzalez, G				Zalamea, Marcela; Gonzalez, Grizelle			Leaffall phenology in a subtropical wet forest in Puerto Rico: From species to community patterns	BIOTROPICA												Leaffall phenology is an important periodical event in forests, contributing to mobilization of organic matter from primary producers to soil. For seasonal forests, leaffall periodicity has been related to rainfall regime and dry season length. In weakly seasonal forests, where there is no marked dry season, other climatic factors could trigger leafshed. In this study, we aimed to determine if other climatic variables (wind speed, solar radiation, photosynthetic photon flux density [PPFD], day length, temperature, and relative humidity) could be better correlated with patterns of litter and leaffall in a weakly seasonal subtropical wet forest in,Puerto Rico. Leaffall patterns were correlated mainly with solar radiation, PPFD, day length, and temperature; and secondarily with rainfall. Two main peaks of leaffall were observed: April-June and August-September, coinciding with the periods of major solar radiation at this latitude. Community leaffall patterns were the result of overlapping peaks of individual species. Of the 32 species analyzed, 21 showed phenological patterns, either unimodal (16 species), bimodal (three species), or multimodal (two species). Lianas also presented leaffall seasonality suggesting that they are subject to the same constraints and triggering factors affecting trees. In addition to solar radiation as a main determinant of leaffall timing in tropical forests, our findings highlight the importance of interannual variation and asynchrony, suggesting that leaffall is the result of a complex interaction between environmental and physiological factors.

J	Schmidt, PS; Paaby, AB				Schmidt, Paul S.; Paaby, Annalise B.			Reproductive diapause and life-history clines in North American populations of Drosophila melanogaster	EVOLUTION												Latitudinal clines are widespread in Drosophila melanogaster, and many have been interpreted as adaptive responses to climatic variation. However, the selective mechanisms generating many such patterns remain unresolved, and there is relatively little information regarding how basic life-history components such as fecundity, life span and mortality rates vary across environmental gradients. Here, it is shown that four life-history traits vary predictably with geographic origin of populations sampled along the latitudinal gradient in the eastern United States. Although such patterns are indicative of selection, they cannot distinguish between the direct action of selection on the traits in question or indirect selection by means of underlying genetic correlations. When independent suites of traits covary with geography, it is therefore critical to separate the widespread effects of population source from variation specifically for the traits under investigation. One trait that is associated with variation in life histories and also varies with latitude is the propensity to express reproductive diapause; diapause expression has been hypothesized as a mechanism by which D. melanogaster adults overwinter, and as such may be subject to strong selection in temperate habitats. In this study, recently derived isofemale lines were used to assess the relative contributions of population source and diapause genotype in generating the observed variance for life histories. It is shown that although life span, fecundity and mortality rates varied predictably with geography, diapause genotype explained the majority of the variance for these traits in the sampled populations. Both heat and cold shock resistance were also observed to vary predictably with latitude for the sampled populations. Cold shock tolerance varied between diapause genotypes and the magnitude of this difference varied with geography, whereas heat shock tolerance was affected solely by geographic origin of the populations. These data suggest that a subset of life-history parameters is significantly influenced by the genetic variance for diapause expression in natural populations, and that the observed variance for longevity and fecundity profiles may reflect indirect action of selection on diapause and other correlated traits.																	0014-3820					MAY	2008	62	5					1204	1215		10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00351.x								WOS:000255532900016	18298646

Phenotypic diversity as an adaptation to environmental uncertainty	EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH												Question: What is the general quantitative relationship between adaptive phenotypic diversity, or bet-hedging, and the environmental uncertainty that selects for it? Mathematical methods: Building on the fitness set approach introduced by Levins, we develop a graphical heuristic for determining the optimal amount of diversity in a fluctuating environment. We use as our optimality criterion the expected long-term growth rate of a lineage. Key insights: Each of the phenotypes in a polyphenic population may be seen as investing a certain proportion of its reproductive effort in each of the possible environments. A bet-hedging lineage that produces the phenotypes in just the right proportions-so that the overall reproductive investment in each environment matches the environmental frequencies-grows faster on average than other lineages. How much faster it grows than the resident population, and thus the strength of selection towards the optimal bet-hedging strategy, depends on how far the residents are from the optimal investment profile. Predictions: A rigorous empirical demonstration that bet-hedging is adaptive requires a comparison of the degree of phenotypic diversification in similar populations subject to varying levels of environmental uncertainty. We confirm that bet-hedging should be observed only within a certain range of environmental variation; when the environment is more predictable than this, a phenotypic generalist would do better. We furthermore provide a simple method to calculate this range, based on the shape of the fitness trade-offs. Within this range, we predict a linear relationship between the frequency of phenotypes and the frequency of environments, independent of the shape of the trade-offs.

An age-structured model for rapid voltinism change in an alien lepidopteran pest	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												Hyphantria cunea Drury invaded Japan at Tokyo in 1945 and expanded its distribution gradually into northern and south-western Japan. All populations in Japan were bivoltine until the early 1970s, at which time trivoltine populations appeared in several southern regions. Presently, H. cunea exists as separate bivoltine and trivoltine populations divided around latitude 36 degrees. In the course of this voltinism change, the mean surface temperature in Japan rose by 1.0 degrees C. To determine whether and how this temperature increase might be responsible for the voltinism change, we constructed an age-structured model incorporating growth speed driven by actual daily temperature and detailed mechanisms of diapause induction triggered by both daily photoperiod and temperature. The simulation result suggests that both the acceleration of the growth speed and the prolongation of diapause induction are necessary to cause changes in voltinism, regardless of temperature increase. We concluded that the H. cunea population changed its life-history traits as an adaptation parallel with its invasion into the south-western parts of Japan. Though the temperature increase had little effect on the fitness and heat stress in bivoltine and trivoltine populations, the trivoltine life cycle has become advantageous at least in marginal regions such as Tokyo.																	0021-8790					MAY	2008	77	3					585	596		10.1111/j.1365-2656.2008.01367.x								WOS:000254990300019	18266693

Determinacy reduces aboveground plant biomass and accelerates and synchronizes flowering. Photoperiod insensitivity allows common bean to be grown at higher latitudes under long days. In this study, we attempted to identify Phaseolus vulgaris homologues of 12 Arabidopsis genes that are involved in meristem identity determination and the photoperiod-dependent and autonomous flowering pathways. Amplification products with homology to the original Arabidopsis gene were obtained for 8 genes, 7 of which could be mapped onto the common bean-linkage map using the BAT93 x Jalo EEP 558 and Midas x G12873 recombinant inbred populations. Three Terminal Flower 1 homologues (PvTFL1x, PvTFL1y, and PvTFL1z) were mapped to B4, B1, and B7, respectively. PvTFL1y cosegregated with the determinacy locus, fin. In addition, PvTFL1z mapped near or at a second determinacy locus on B7. A Zeitlupe homologue mapped near a quantitative trait locus (QTL) for flowering time on linkage group B9. Constans, FCA, Flowering locus D, Gigantea, and Leafy homologues did not cosegregate with currently mapped flowering time QTLs and photoperiod insensitivity loci in common bean. Further studies are needed to confirm the role of these homologues as potential candidate genes.

Nongenetic individuality in the host-phage interaction	PLOS BIOLOGY												Isogenic bacteria can exhibit a range of phenotypes, even in homogeneous environmental conditions. Such nongenetic individuality has been observed in a wide range of biological processes, including differentiation and stress response. A striking example is the heterogeneous response of bacteria to antibiotics, whereby a small fraction of drug-sensitive bacteria can persist under extensive antibiotic treatments. We have previously shown that persistent bacteria enter a phenotypic state, identified by slow growth or dormancy, which protects them from the lethal action of antibiotics. Here, we studied the effect of persistence on the interaction between Escherichia coli and phage lambda. We used long-term time-lapse microscopy to follow the expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the phage lytic promoter, as well as cellular fate, in single infected bacteria. Intriguingly, we found that, whereas persistent bacteria are protected from prophage induction, they are not protected from lytic infection. Quantitative analysis of gene expression reveals that the expression of lytic genes is suppressed in persistent bacteria. However, when persistent bacteria switch to normal growth, the infecting phage resumes the process of gene expression, ultimately causing cell lysis. Using mathematical models for these two host-phage interactions, we found that the bacteria's nongenetic individuality can significantly affect the population dynamics, and might be relevant for understanding the coevolution of bacterial hosts and phages.

Latitude dependent arrhythmicity in the circadian oviposition rhythm of Drosophila ananassale	BIOLOGICAL RHYTHM RESEARCH												Latitude dependent arrhythmicity in the circadian rhythm of oviposition of Drosophila ananassae strains originating from 8.1 degrees N to 32.7 degrees N was studied by inbreeding them in cycles of 12 h of light at 20 lux and 12 h of darkness. The number of inbreeding generations required to initiate arrhythmicity in oviposition rhythm was dependent on the origin of latitude of the strain. The strains from the lower latitudes became arrhythmic after notably more numbers of generations than those from the higher latitudes. This might be attributed to the higher inherent degree of oviposition rhythmicity in the F-1 generation, and enhanced photic sensitivity of the circadian pacemaker mediating entrainment of oviposition rhythm of the strains from lower latitudes as compared to those from the higher latitudes.																	0929-1016					APR	2008	39	2					143	150		10.1080/09291010701424788								WOS:000253808000005

This site is significant for its importance to the local nesting ecology of this snake. Data were collected from captured snakes, and individuals were marked and photographed to enable identification upon subsequent recapture. A minimum of 39 adult Bullsnakes were known to utilize a single bluff over a period spanning five years from 1998 to 2002. Fifteen gravid females were found over this span nesting in a single borrow complex. Bullsnakes were found to excavate their own nesting burrows at the site, and to show nest site fidelity. The congregation of numbers of these snakes at localized sites of importance to nesting biology renders them potentially Vulnerable, and may present conservation challenges.																	0008-3550					APR-JUN	2008	122	2					138	141		10.22621/cfn.v122i2.572								WOS:000272674300005

Genetic differentiation in diapause response along a latitudinal cline in European yellow dung fly populations	ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												1. Seasonality is a prime selective factor expected to result in local adaptation of life cycles and dormancy. Genetic differentiation in diapause response was investigated along a European latitudinal cline in the dung fly Scathophaga stercoraria (Diptera: Scathophagidae). Such differentiation may be mediated by additive or dominance genetic and/or maternal effects, which need to be distinguished. 2. Replicate sibships from five European populations (Lugano, Switzerland: 46.00 degrees N; Zurich, Switzerland: 47.37 degrees N; Oxford, U.K.: 51.75 degrees N; Lund, Sweden: 55.70 degrees N; Reykjavik, Iceland: 64.15 degrees N) were raised in a common laboratory environment known to induce pupal winter diapause (12 degrees C and 12 h light), revealing a genetic latitudinal cline in both the proportion of individuals entering diapause and diapause duration in response to winter length estimated from weather data. 3. Populations from the extremes of the cline (Lugano and Reykjavik) were further reciprocally crossed to investigate the underlying genetics. This experiment revealed evidence for diapause induction at 12 degrees C being dominant (i.e. not merely additive) and clearly rejected maternal effects as the primary source of this between-population variation.																	0307-6946					APR	2008	33	2					197	201		10.1111/j.1365-2311.2007.00951.x								WOS:000253710000006

Characterizing laboratory colonies of western corn rootworm (Coleoptera : Chrysomelidae) selected for survival on maize containing event DAS-59122-7	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY												Event DAS-59122-7 is a novel transgenic trait designed to protect the roots and yield potential of maize from the insect pest corn rootworm Diabrotica spp. (Col.: Chrysomelidae). The increased pest status of corn rootworm, exceptional efficacy of this trait, and anticipated increases in farm efficiency and grower and environmental safety will drive adoption of this trait. Strong grower acceptance of this trait highlights the importance of science-based and practical resistance management strategies. A non-diapause trait was introgressed into two laboratory colonies of Diabrotica virgifera virgifera collected from geographically distinct locations: Rochelle, IL and York, NE. Both colonies were divided and each reared on maize containing event DAS-59122-7 or its near isoline. Selected and unselected colonies were evaluated for phenotypic change in larval development, injury potential and survival to adulthood during 10 and 11 generations. The Fl generation of both selected colonies displayed increased larval development, survivorship and measurable, but economically insignificant increases in injury potential on DAS-59122-7 maize. Survival rates of 0.4 and t.3% in Fl generations of both selected colonies corroborate field estimates of survival on DAS-59122-7 maize. Over later generations, total phenotypic variation declined gradually and irregularly. Despite the absence of random mating, the tolerance trait could not be fixed in either population after 10 or 11 generations of selection. An allele conferring major resistance to DAS-59122-7 was not identified in either selected colony. The assessment also concluded that major resistance gene(s) are rare in Populations of D. v. virgifera in the United States, and that a minor trait(s) conferring a low level of survival on DAS-59122-7 maize was present. The tolerance trait identified in this study was considered minor with respect to its impact on DAS-59122-7 maize efficacy, and the role this trait may play in total effective refuge for major resistance genes with recessive inheritance is the basis of future work.																	0931-2048					APR	2008	132	3					189	204		10.1111/j.1439-0418.2008.01279.x								WOS:000254703300002

The strongly seasonal Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus, reside in lakes covered by thick ice and snow throughout the dark winter in the north. In the present study, we have measured diel changes in their plasma tnelatonin concentrations from September to June in Lake Storvatnet (70 degrees N), northern Norway. In addition, we have measured the in vitro melatonin production of Arctic chart pineal glands held at experimental light conditions. From September to April a diel profile in plasma tnelatonin was seen in the charr in Lake Storvatn, with highest concentrations at night. This profile reflected the prevailing above-surface photoperiod, even in February when there were minimal changes in sub-surface irradiance between day and night. In June, plasma tnelatonin was low throughout the 24-hr cycle, despite there being a marked sub-surface difference in irradiance between night and day. At this time the irradiance in night probably remained above the threshold for suppression of melatonin production. The in vitro experiments revealed no endogenous rhythm in the pineal melatonin secretion, supporting the conclusion that the diel profile seen in the Arctic charr in their natural habitat was driven by ambient photoperiod. In conclusion, the Arctic charr appear to keep track of time even under the extreme conditions of high latitudes during winter, when lakes have thick ice and snow cover.																	0742-3098					APR	2008	44	3					227	233		10.1111/j.1600-079X.2007.00511.x								WOS:000254703400001	18339117					
J	Mahdjoub, T; Menu, F				Mahdjoub, Tewfik; Menu, Frederic			Prolonged diapause: A trait increasing invasion speed?	JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY												Invasive species are considered to be the second cause of biodiversity erosion, and one challenge is to determine the life history traits that cause an increased invasion capacity. Prolonged diapause is a major trait in evolution and insect population dynamics, but its effects on invasion speed remain unknown. From a recently developed mathematical approach (integro-difference equations) applied to the insect dormancy, we show that despite a dispersal cost, bet-hedging diapause strategies with low (0.1-0.2) prolonged diapause frequency (emergence after I or 2 years) can have a higher invasion speed than a simple diapause strategy (emergence after I year) when the environmental stochasticity is sufficiently high. In such conditions, prolonged diapause is a trait supporting invasion capacity by increasing population stochastic growth rate. This conclusion, which applies to a large range of demographic parameters, is in opposition to the usual view that prolonged dormancy is an alternative strategy to dispersal. However, prolonged diapause does not support invasion if the level of environmental stochasticity is low. Therefore, conclusion about its influence on invasion ability needs a good knowledge of environmental stochasticity in the introduction area of considered species. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Lu, PL; Yu, Q; Wang, E; Liu, JD; Xu, SH				Lu, Pei-Ling; Yu, Qiang; Wang, Enli; Liu, Jian-Dong; Xu, Shou-Hua			Effects of climatic variation and warming on rice development across South China	CLIMATE RESEARCH												Rice Oryza sativa L. development-and also its response to climatic change - is mainly determined by temperature and photoperiod. An experiment was conducted to study the influence of meteorological factors on growth and development of hybrid rice in South China, in which seeds were sown at different sites at different dates in the spring. The 29 experimental sites were spread over a large area, with latitudes from 21 degrees 39' to 34 degrees 16'N and altitudes from 1 to 1862 m above sea level. It was found that the length of the growth period at low latitudes (21 to 25 degrees N) was mainly determined by temperature and showed a single-peaked curve with an optimum temperature at about 25.7 degrees C. The temperature response of development is almost linear at high latitudes (25 to 35 degrees N), but the dependence is not as close and significant as that at low latitude, due to longer daylength and its higher variation. A phenological-simulation model with a biological basis was used to simulate the developmental stages of rice in South China. It described both thermal sensitivity and photoperiodism using nonlinear equations. The model was validated by data of sowing-date experiments carried out at different geographical sites, and then was applied to evaluate changes in the length of the rice-growth period in response to climate warming during the period from 1951 to 2006. Because there was significant warming, and the length of the growth period was sensitive to this change over the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, the length of the growth period was narrowed by 6 to 14 d (comparing 1990 to 2006 with 1951 to 1989), whereas it was shortened by I to 2 d in most low plain areas in South China. The probability of serious temperature related crop failure will increase if planting of a late-maturity variety is adopted in high altitude areas.

Climate change effects on poikilotherm tritrophic interactions	CLIMATIC CHANGE												Species of plants and animals have characteristic climatic requirements for growth, survival and reproduction that limit their geographic distribution, abundance and interactions with other species. To analyze this complexity requires the development of models that include not only the effects of biotic factors on species dynamics and interactions, but also the effects of abiotic factors including weather. The need for such capacity has appreciably increased as we face the threat of global climate change. In this paper, bi- and tri-trophic physiologically based demographic models of alfalfa, cotton, grape, olive and the noxious weed yellow starthistle systems are used to explore some of the potential effects of climate change. A general model that applies to all species in all trophic levels (including the economic one) is used to simulate the effects of observed and projected weather on system dynamics. Observed daily weather and that of climate model scenarios were used as forcing variables in our studies. Geographic information system (GRASS GIS) is used to map the predicted effects on species across the varied ecological zones of California. The predictions of the geographic distribution and abundance of the various species examined accords well with field observations. Furthermore, the models predict how the geographic range and abundance of the some species would be affected by climate change. Among the findings are: (1) The geographic range of tree species such as olive that require chilling to break dormancy (i.e. vernalization) may be limited in some areas due to climate warming, but their range may expand in others. For example, olive phenology and yield will be affected in the southern part of California due to high temperature, but may expand in northern areas until limited by low winter temperatures. Pest distribution and abundance will also be affected. For example, climate warming would allow the cold intolerant pink bollworm in cotton to expand its range into formerly inhospitable heavy frost areas of the San Joaquin Valley, and damage rates will increase throughout its current range. The distribution and abundance of other cold intolerant pests such as olive fly, the Mediterranean fruit fly and others could be similarly affected. In addition, species dominance and existence in food webs could change (e.g. in alfalfa), and the biological control of invasive species might be adversely affected (e.g. vine mealybug in grape). The distribution and abundance of invasive weeds such as yellow starthistle will be altered, and its control by extant and new biological control agents will be difficult to predict because climate change will differentially affects each. (2) Marginal analysis of multiple regression models of the simulation data provides a useful way of analyzing the efficacy of biological control agents. Models could be useful as guides in future biological control efforts on extant and new exotic pest species. (3) Major deficiencies in our capacity to predict the effects of climate change on biological interactions were identified: (1) There is need to improve existing models to better forecast the effects of climate change on crop system components; (2) The current system for collecting daily weather data consists of a patchwork of station of varying reliability that often record different variables and in different units. Especially vexing, is the dearth of solar radiation data at many locations. This was an unexpected finding as solar energy is an important driving variable in biological systems.

In the special case of the dragonfly Gomphus vulgatissimus (L.) (Odonata: Gomphidae) previous research suggests that voltinism decreases from south to north. We analysed data on voltinism from 11 sample sites along a latitudinal gradient from about 44 degrees N to 53 degrees N, comprising small streams to medium-sized rivers. Furthermore, to simulate different conditions and to allow projections for future climate change scenarios, we developed a population dynamic model based on a projection matrix approach. The parameters of the model are dependent on temperature and day length. Our field results indicate a decrease in voltinism along the latitudinal gradient from southern to northern Europe and a corresponding increase of voltinism with higher temperatures. An increase in voltinism with width of the running water implies an effect of varying habitat temperature. Under the impact of global warming, our model predicts an increased development speed, particularly in the northern part of the latitudinal gradient, an extension of the northern range limit and changes in phenology of G. vulgatissimus, leading to an extension of the flight season in certain regions along the gradient.

Assessment of the physicochemical parameters and heavy metals toxicity of leachates from municipal solid waste open dumpsite	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Heavy metals and physicochemical characteristics of the different sites of the municipal solid waste dumpsite at Olusosun Landfill, Lagos, Nigeria, were investigated. The dormant site of the landfill has the potential of being a source of immediate environmental risk compared to the active and abandoned site, with the active site exhibiting tendency to be a likely source of Pb, Cd and Zn pollution. Zn was the most abundant metal in the area (0.264-0.947 mg/L) while Cd concentration was the lowest (0.001-0.022 mg/L). Pb, Cd, Zn were from anthropogenic sources and correlated significantly with chemical oxygen demand and oil and grease. Cu and Cr were more abundant in the dormant site and are attached to the solids as indicated by their significant correlation with TS and SS. The physicochemical characteristic of the leachate from the landfill indicate that they were more alkaline in nature, with TA range of 2354 to 7946 mg/L while the chemical oxygen demand values was also high 518.14 to 725.01 mg/L. The comparative analysis of the dormant site with other dormant site reveal a moderate concentration of the parameters measured but could contaminate the neighboring groundwater if not checked.

Deciduousness in a seasonal tropical forest in western Thailand: interannual and intraspecific variation in timing, duration and environmental cues	OECOLOGIA												Seasonal tropical forests exhibit a great diversity of leaf exchange patterns. Within these forests variation in the timing and intensity of leaf exchange may occur within and among individual trees and species, as well as from year to year. Understanding what generates this diversity of phenological behaviour requires a mechanistic model that incorporates rate-limiting physiological conditions, environmental cues, and their interactions. In this study we examined long-term patterns of leaf flushing for a large proportion of the hundreds of tree species that co-occur in a seasonal tropical forest community in western Thailand. We used the data to examine community-wide variation in deciduousness and tested competing hypotheses regarding the timing and triggers of leaf flushing in seasonal tropical forests. We developed metrics to quantify the nature of deciduousness (its magnitude, timing and duration) and its variability among survey years and across a range of taxonomic levels. Tree species varied widely in the magnitude, duration, and variability of leaf loss within species and across years. The magnitude of deciduousness ranged from complete crown loss to no crown loss. Among species that lost most of their crown, the duration of deciduousness ranged from 2 to 21 weeks. The duration of deciduousness in the majority of species was considerably shorter than in neotropical forests with similar rainfall periodicity. While the timing of leaf flushing varied among species, most (similar to 70%) flushed during the dry season. Leaf flushing was associated with changes in photoperiod in some species and the timing of rainfall in other species. However, more than a third of species showed no clear association with either photoperiod or rainfall, despite the considerable length and depth of the dataset. Further progress in resolving the underlying internal and external mechanisms controlling leaf exchange will require targeting these species for detailed physiological and microclimatic studies.

Long day conditions (16 h photoperiod) shortened development of the field populations with 2-3 days when compared with short day conditions (12 h photoperiod). Oviposition in the field populations was delayed by 1-3 months when reared at a 12 h photoperiod. Dissections indicated that the females were in reproductive diapause. As compared with live pea aphids, a diet consisting of E. kuehniella eggs yielded heavier adult body weights (up to 12%) and increased the number of egg laying days (by 45-169%) for both field populations at a 16 h photoperiod and lengthened adult life span (by 45-92%) under both light regimens. The morph types differed in their response to the foods offered in terms of developmental rate, pre-oviposition period and number of oviposition days. The laboratory and field strains responded differentially to regimens of food and photoperiod. The study indicated a greater nutritional plasticity of the non-melanic morphs which may offer them a competitive advantage that may in part explain the predominance of non-melanic morphs in newly colonized areas.

Dinoflagellate diversity and distribution	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Dinoflagellates are common to abundant in both marine and freshwater environments. They are particularly diverse in the marine plankton where some cause "red tides" and other harmful blooms. More than 2,000 extant species have been described, only half of which are photosynthetic. They include autotrophs, mixotrophs and grazers. They are biochemically diverse, varying in photosynthetic pigments and toxin production ability. Some are important sources of bioluminescence in the ocean. They can host intracellular symbionts or be endosymbionts themselves. Most of the photosynthetic "zooxanthellae" of invertebrate hosts are mutualistic dinoflagellate symbionts, including all those essential to reef-building corals. Roughly 5% are parasitic on aquatic organisms. The fossil record, consisting of more than 2,500 species, shows a rapid radiation of cysts, starting in the Triassic, peaking in the Cretaceous, and declining throughout the Cenozoic. Marine species with a benthic, dormant cyst stage are confined to the continental shelf and fossil cysts can be used as markers of ancient coastlines. Northern and southern hemispheres contain virtually identical communities within similar latitudes, separated by a belt of circumtropical species. A few endemics are present in tropical and polar waters. Some benthic dinoflagellates are exclusively tropical, including a distinct phycophilic community, some of which are responsible for ciguatera fish poisoning. In lakes chemical and grazing effects can be important. Predatory dinoflagellates co-occur with their prey, often diatoms.																	0960-3115					FEB	2008	17	2					407	418		10.1007/s10531-007-9258-3								WOS:000252689400013						
J	Wiegand, T; Naves, J; Garbulsky, MF; Fernandez, N				Wiegand, Thorsten; Naves, Javier; Garbulsky, Martin F.; Fernandez, Nestor			Animal habitat quality and ecosystem functioning: Exploring seasonal patterns using NDVI	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												Many animal species have developed specific evolutionary adaptations to survive prolonged periods of low energy availability that characterize seasonal environments. The seasonal course of primary production, a major aspect of ecosystem functioning, should therefore be an important factor determining the habitat quality of such species. We tested this hypothesis by analyzing the relationship between habitat quality and ecosystem functioning for brown bears (Ursus arctos), a species showing hyperphagia and hibernation as evolutionary adaptation to seasonal peaks and bottlenecks in ecosystem productivity, respectively. Our unique long-term data set comprised data from two brown bear populations in northern Spain on historical presence, current presence, and reproduction. The data were classified on a grid of 5 3 5 km pixels into five classes: frequent reproduction, sporadic reproduction, frequent presence, sporadic presence, and recent extinction. We used the long-term average of the seasonal course of NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) as a proxy for ecosystem functioning and investigated the relationship between habitat quality and ecosystem functioning with methods borrowed from statistical point-pattern analysis. We found that brown bears indeed selected habitat with specific ecosystem functioning (i.e., the variance in all habitat classes was smaller than in the landscape overall) and the relationship between habitat quality and ecosystem functioning was ordered. First, the average distance in ecosystem functioning between two habitat classes was larger if the difference in habitat quality was larger. Second, habitat for which there was the greatest need (i.e., breeding habitat) occupied the narrowest niche regarding ecosystem functioning and showed the most pronounced seasonality. Progressively poorer classes occupied wider niches that partly overlapped those of better classes. This indicated that nonbreeding animals are less selective. Our methodology provided new insight into the relationship between ecosystem functioning and habitat quality and could be widely applied to animal species living in seasonal environments. Because NDVI data are continuously collected, our methodology allows for continuous monitoring of changes in habitat quality due to global change.

Development, survivorship, and reproduction of Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera : Noctuidae) under constant and alternating temperatures	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												Laboratory studies were conducted to assess the effect of temperature on the survival, development, fecundity, and longevity of Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) at 11 constant temperatures ranging from 12.5 to 40 degrees C, as well as at five alternating temperature regimes (25-10, 30-15, 32.5-17.5, 35-20, and 35-27.5 degrees C) and under a photoperiod of 16:8 (L.D) h. H. armigera reared at constant temperatures did not develop from egg to adult (emergence) outside the temperature range of 17.5-32.5 degrees C. The alternating conditions expanded this range from 10 to 35 degrees C. The lowest developmental thresholds of the immature stages were estimated by a linear model and ranged from 10.17 (pupal stage) to 11.95 degrees C (egg stage) at constant temperature regimes and from 1.1 to 5.5 degrees C, respectively at alternating temperatures. The values of developmental thresholds estimated using the nonlinear (Lactin-2) model were lower than those estimated by the linear model for constant and alternating temperature regimes except for larval and pupal stages at constant temperatures. Mean adult longevity fluctuated from 34.4 d at 15 degrees C to 7.6 d at 35 degrees C. Females reared under all alternating temperature regimes laid more eggs than females reared at any, except the 25 degrees C, constant temperature treatment. The intrinsic rate of increase was highest at 27.5 degrees C, at both the constant and the corresponding alternating temperature regimes (0.147 and 0.139, respectively). Extreme temperatures had a negative effect on life table parameters.																	0046-225X	1938-2936				FEB	2008	37	1					16	28		10.1603/0046-225X(2008)37[16:DSAROH]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000253183300003	18348792					
J	Song, J; Clemens, J; Jameson, PE				Song, Jiancheng; Clemens, John; Jameson, Paula Elizabeth			Quantitative expression analysis of the ABC genes in Sophora tetraptera, a woody legume with an unusual sequence of floral organ development	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY												Sophora is a woody genus of the Leguminosae in which an unusual order and process of. oral organ development is often observed. The SEM results for Sophora tetraptera revealed precocious initiation of the carpel, delayed development of petals, and. oral organ development interrupted by an unusual prolonged summer-autumn dormant period which occurred between organ initiation and organ differentiation. These observations provided an opportunity to track key. oral identity genes over an extended developmental period. Homologues of LEAFY, APETALA1, PISTILLATA, and AGAMOUS were isolated from S. tetraptera. Real-time PCR enabled a simultaneous and quantitative analysis of both the temporal and spatial expression patterns of these four genes. Expression differences in the range of three to five orders of magnitude were detected between different genes and between different stages of flower development for the same gene. Although not functionally tested, the spatial expression patterns of the genes were consistent with expectations based on the ABC model of. oral development. Their temporal expression patterns were consistent with the timing of flower initiation and the unusual order of organ development. Quantitatively, while the expression levels of the LFY homologue and the A-class gene were high during the periods of organ initiation and organ differentiation and low during the summer-autumn dormant period, high expression levels of the B- and C-class genes were detected only during the rapid, albeit delayed, phase of organ differentiation. Additionally, the sustained expression of the floral organ identity genes after differentiation reflects on-going roles for these genes during subsequent organ development.																	0022-0957					FEB	2008	59	2					247	259		10.1093/jxb/erm305								WOS:000254006500013	18238803

Integrating individual behaviour and landscape genetics: the population tructure of timber rattlesnake hibernacula	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Individuals of many species show high levels of fidelity to natal populations, often due to reliance on patchily distributed habitat features. In many of these species, the negative impacts of inbreeding are mitigated through specialized behaviours such as seasonal mating dispersal. Quantifying population structure for species with these characteristics can potentially elucidate social and environmental factors that interact to affect mating behaviour and population connectivity. In the northern part of their range, timber rattlesnakes are communal hibernators with high natal philopatry. Individuals generally recruit to the same hibernaculum as their mother and remain faithful to that hibernaculum throughout their lives. We examined the genetic structure of Crotalus horridus hibernacula in the northeastern USA using microsatellite loci. Sampled hibernacula exhibited only modest levels of differentiation, indicating a significant level of gene flow among them. We found no significant correlation between genetic differentiation and geographical distance, but did find significant positive correlation between genetic differentiation and a cost-based distance metric adjusted to include the amount of potential basking habitat between hibernacula. Therefore, thermoregulation sites may increase gene flow by increasing the potential for contact among individuals from different populations. Parentage analyses confirmed high levels of philopatry of both sexes to their maternal hibernaculum; however, approximately one-third of paternity assignments involved individuals between hibernacula, confirming that gene flow among hibernacula occurs largely through seasonal male mating dispersal. Our results underscore the importance of integrating individual-level behaviours and landscape features with studies of fine-scale population genetics in species with high fidelity to patchily distributed habitats.

Contrary to the photoperiod pathway, convergent evolution of the cold-dependent pathway has implicated different genes between dicots and monocots. Whereas no association between natural variation in vernalization requirement and Flowering time locus T (FT) gene polymorphism has been described in Arabidopsis, recent studies in Triticeae suggest implication of orthologous copies of FT in the cold response. In our study, we show that nucleotide polymorphisms on A and D copies of the wheat FT gene were associated with variations for heading date in a collection of 239 lines representing diverse geographical origins and status (landraces, old or recent cultivars). Interestingly, polymorphisms in the non-coding intronic region were strongly associated to flowering variation observed on plants grown without vernalization. But differently from VRN1, no epistatic interaction between FT homeologous copies was revealed. In agreement with the results of association study, the A and D copies of FT were mapped in regions including major QTLs for earliness traits in hexaploid wheat. This work, by identifying additional homeoalleles involved in wheat vernalization pathway, will contribute to a better understanding of the control of flowering, hence providing tools for the breeding of varieties with enhanced adaptation to changing environments.																	0040-5752	1432-2242				FEB	2008	116	3					383	394		10.1007/s00122-007-0676-0								WOS:000252542400008	18040656

Environmental stress can accelerate the evolutionary rate of specific stress-response proteins and create new functions specialized for different environments, enhancing an organism's fitness to stressful environments. Pikas (order Lagomorpha), endemic, non-hibernating mammals in the modern Holarctic Region, live in cold regions at either high altitudes or high latitudes and have a maximum distribution of species diversification confined to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Variations in energy metabolism are remarkable for them living in cold environments. Leptin, an adipocyte-derived hormone, plays important roles in energy homeostasis. Methodology/Principal Findings. To examine the extent of leptin variations within the Ochotona family, we cloned the entire coding sequence of pika leptin from 6 species in two regions (Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and Inner Mongolia steppe in China) and the leptin sequences of plateau pikas (O. curzonia) from different altitudes on Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. We carried out both DNA and amino acid sequence analyses in molecular evolution and compared modeled spatial structures. Our results show that positive selection (PS) acts on pika leptin, while nine PS sites located within the functionally significant segment 85-119 of leptin and one unique motif appeared only in pika lineages-the ATP synthase a and b subunit signature site. To reveal the environmental factors affecting sequence evolution of pika leptin, relative rate test was performed in pikas from different altitudes. Stepwise multiple regression shows that temperature is significantly and negatively correlated with the rates of non-synonymous substitution (Ka) and amino acid substitution (Aa), whereas altitude does not significantly affect synonymous substitution (Ks), Ka and Aa. Conclusions/Significance. Our findings support the viewpoint that adaptive evolution may occur in pika leptin, which may play important roles in pikas' ecological adaptation to extreme environmental stress. We speculate that cold, and probably not hypoxia, may be the primary environmental factor for driving adaptive evolution of pika leptin.																	1932-6203					JAN 23	2008	3	1							e1472	10.1371/journal.pone.0001472								WOS:000260503900017	18213380

Life history, aggregation and dormancy of the rubber plantation litter beetle, Luprops tristis, from the rubber plantations of moist south Western Ghats	JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE												Life history, aggregation and dormancy of rubber plantation litter beetle Luprops tristis Fabricius, (Tenebrionidae: Coleoptera) is described from rubber plantation belts in the western slopes of Western Ghats from the south Indian state of Kerala. The life cycle lasted 12 months, including the 5 larval instars lasting 1 month, the 3 day pupal stage, and the adult stage that can last 11 months. The adult stage includes an inactive dormancy phase of 9 months in shelters and 1 month each of active pre-dormancy (feeding) and post-dormancy (feeding and reproduction) phases that occur in rubber plantation litter. Reproductive activities are confined to the post-dormancy phase. With the onset of summer rains, huge aggregations of adults invade residential buildings and enter into a state of dormancy for 9 months. Beetle aggregations were in the range of 0.5 million to 4.5 million individuals per residential building. Dormancy in L. tristis is best classified as oligopause, which is intermediate between quiescence and diapause. Adults and larvae feed preferentially on wilted rubber tree leaves. Age-specific variation in mortality during dormancy is distinct with higher survivability for adults that have a longer pre-dormancy period. Generations are non-overlapping.																	1536-2442					JAN 8	2008	8								1									WOS:000253056600001	20345315

Females overwinter as inseminated adults and exit diapause in New Jersey when spring peepers (Pseudacris crucifer) are calling. We tested the hypothesis that Cx. territans uses amphibian vocalizations as a long-distance attractant. Two thirds of females oriented toward sound across all experiments. Females allowed to orient toward or away from a frog call, bird song, live frog, or control (a plugged in compact disc player) exhibited positive phonotaxis only to the frog call. Females exhibited positive phonotaxis to calls of P. crucifer, Hyla versicolor (northern gray tree frog), Bufo americanus (American toad), and Rana clamitans (green frog), but they were not attracted to calls of R. catesbeiana (bullfrog), R. sylvatica (wood frog), or control, Multiple regression analysis showed that call frequency is the best predictor for phonotaxis, with pulse duration and call amplitude increasing the attractiveness of the source. When exposed to P. crucifer calls at increasing sound intensity levels, females oriented to calls in the range of 50-75 dB, with particle velocities of 0.02-0.3 mm/s, indicating that phonotaxis occurs at distances > 5 m from the source.

HEAT STRESS EFFECTS ON GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT IN THREE ECOTYPES OF VARYING LATITUDE OF ARABIDOPSIS	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Global temperatures have increased 0.6 degrees C over the past century; however regional temperatures have shown greater fluctuations. Since local environmental conditions vary along latitudinal clines, latitude has become an essential component in projecting plant response to warming. Three ecotypes of Arabidopsis were selected from varying latitudes in order to investigate heat stress within an ecotype and project potential effects across a gradient. Control and heat stressed groups received 12 hour photoperiods. Control plants were grown at 2.7/22.7 degrees C day/night mean temperatures and heat stressed plants were grown at 22.7/29 degrees C day/night mean temperatures. Plants were quantified and harvested 35 days after sowing. The number of rosette leaves, flower buds, and fruits resulted in significant differences both between control and heat stressed plants of the same ecotype and also across ecotypes. Heat overwhelmingly resulted in a quantitative decrease across all parameters, including overall plant size, with the exception of flowers in ecotype 902. And even though the heat stressed 902 plants flowered while the control group plants did not, neither produced fruit. Thus, heat adversely affects growth and development as well as reproductive success in Arabidopsis.																	1589-1623						2008	6	4					1	14										WOS:000265576500001

Evolution of biennial life cycles in ground beetles (Coleoptera, Carabidae) of the Western Palaearctic	BACK TO THE ROOTS AND BACK TO THE FUTURE: TOWARDS A NEW SYNTHESIS AMONGST TAXONOMIC, ECOLOGICAL AND BIOGEOGRAPHICAL APPROACHES IN CARABIDOLOGY, PROCEEDINGS	Pensoft Series Faunistica				13th European Carabidologists Meeting	AUG 20-24, 2007	Blagoevgrad, BULGARIA					Information about the life cycles of 400 Palaearctic carabid species was acquired on the basis of field study and analysis of literature. Five types of biennial development were defined: a biennial life cycle of spring-summer species; a biennial life cycle of summer-autumn species which developed as facultative (only part of the population develops within two years) or obligatory (biennial development occurs in the whole population); biennial life cycle of autumn species which may have appeared in two similar variants facultative and obligatory. So, biennial life cycles have independently evolved in carabid beetles by at least three means: among spring breeders (type 1, according to Thiele, 1977) with gonad dormancy during hibernation and gonad maturation; males in SD, females after changing SD to LD; among autumn breeders (type 3) without gonad dormancy but with temperature controlled larval dormancy during hibernation; among autumn breeders (type 4) with gonad dormancy during aestivation and gonad maturation after changing LD to SD. The similarity and differences between latitudinal and altitudinal trends in biennial development of Carabidae are discussed. In similar, extreme conditions, the parallel variants of biennial development are observed. However even in favorable environments, some individuals may develop over two years. According to the assimilated data for this study, the proportion of species with biennial life cycles in different habitats within the temperate zone is rather high and biennial development is not unusual.																	1312-0174		978-954-642-325-2				2008		75					259	284										WOS:000275086200013

Six species, Cardiaderus chloroticus, Pogonus transfuga, P. meridianalis, Pogonistes rufoaeneus, P. angustus and P. convexicollis, are spring breeders. Among them, P. transfuga, P. meridionalis and P. rufoaeneus are iteroparous while C. chloroticus, P angustus and P convexicollis are semelparous. The life cycles of all these species are monovariant monovoltine with spring or spring-summer reproduction and adult (immature or both immature and spent) hibernation. However, the life cycle in C. chloroticus is possibly bivoltine. In contrast, P. cumanus is an autumn-breeding iteroparous species, its life cycle being monovariant monovoltine with obligate larval hibernation and obligate adult aestivation, parapause. This is a surprising finding, because previously all Pogonini were considered to be "spring breeders" or "imaginal hibernators". Among the species studied, P transfuga and P meridionalis can be characterized as halophiles, because they live in habitats with moderate salinity All the other species are pronounced halobionts because, with rare exceptions only, they are restricted to high-salinity habitats. Parasitic mites of the family Podapolipidae were found on P. transfuga, P meridionalis, P cumanus and P rufoaeneus adults. Survival over winter and reproduction during a second season, together with the new generation specimens, is an important precondition for dispersal of Podapohpidae. On the other hand, this greatly restricts the range of their possible hosts.

A tropical, gregariously semelparous bamboo shows no seed dormancy	BIOTROPICA												Seed dormancy may be disadvantageous for gregariously semelparous plants because it disrupts the high levels of reproductive synchrony necessary for success. Alternately, it may provide a bet-hedging option for an otherwise 'all eggs in the one basket' reproductive strategy. Rapid germination of seeds upon hydration has been demonstrated for a range of tropical, semelparous bamboos, but the fate of seeds that failed to germinate promptly has been inadequately investigated. We demonstrate prompt germination of seeds upon hydration and the absence of a dormant seedbank in a long-lived, gregariously semelparous bamboo, Bambusa arnhemica, from monsoonal northern Australia. However, we refute the suggestion that seed dormancy is necessarily maladaptive in a gregariously semelparous plant. Rather, caryopsis dormancy may not be possible in a seasonally moist tropical climate. Given an inability to adjust or bet-hedge their germination, bamboo germinants must cope with the vagaries of the monsoonal climate, a factor that may contribute to the general restriction of bamboos to regions with higher rainfall.

J	Hodek, I; Michaud, JP				Hodek, Ivo; Michaud, J. P.			Why is Coccinella septempunctata so successful? (A point-of-view)	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY												Factors were examined that could be responsible for the predominance of Coccinella septempunctala (C7) in most habitats of the Palaearctic and for its successful invasion of the Nearctic Region. C7 is euryphagous, but less polyphagous than Harmonia axyridis or Coleomegilla maculata in that it cannot develop or reproduce on non-aphid food. The intraguild status of C7 is intermediate. Although adult size is large, preimaginal stages are palatable to those of H. axyridis and Adalia bipunctata, whereas it is not an intraguild predator of these species. Although these traits appear to be neutral or negative, many aspects of population plasticity are advantageous for C7, often acting in concert with a bet-hedging strategy. Given its high mobility and eurytopy, the inhibition of oviposition in the presence of conspecific larval trails represents an adaptive advantage that favors increased egg dispersal and lowers the risk of offspring mortality due to cannibalism. The ability to temporarily suspend oviposition, combined with heterogenous voltinism and diapause tendencies, enable a portion of C7 populations to feed and reproduce on unpredictably occurring aphid populations. An absence of reproductive diapause in males and pre-hibernation mating are other significant adaptations, along with the tendency to produce offspring in excess of the carrying capacity of local food resources. We suggest that one explanation for the broad geographic success of C7 resides in an ecological plasticity that is based on both genetic and phenotypic polymorphisms.																	1210-5759	1802-8829					2008	105	1					1	12										WOS:000253519400001						
J	Saunders, DS; Cymborowski, B				Saunders, David S.; Cymborowski, Bronislaw			Light-induced behavioural effects on the locomotor activity rhythm of the blow fly, Calliphora vicina (Diptera: Calliphoridae)	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY												Under continuous light (LL) of low intensity (up to 2.0 lux), the free-running period of the blow fly activity rhythm lengthened for flies whose initial DD was less than about 25 h, but shortened for longer-period flies. Light intensity above about 2.0 lux led to an overt behavioural arrhythmicity. A comparison of phases of the oscillation after LL as a function of phases before LL, however, indicated that the oscillation continued its motion even though overt behaviour was arrhythmic. As the intensity during LL increased to 48 lux, phases after LL became centred on a narrow range close to CT 12. Extended periods of brighter light are considered to have two effects: (a) an exogenous "masking" effect occurring at intensities greater than about 2.0 lux, and (b) at intensities between about 2.0 and 48 lux, a gradual resetting of the covert oscillator to CT 12. Between 2.0 and 48 lux, therefore, the circadian oscillation governing locomotor activity in C. vicina continues its motion despite the superficial arrhythmicity in behaviour.																	1210-5759						2008	105	4					585	590		10.14411/eje.2008.078								WOS:000261360200006

Using field sampling, we show that L. reali is a habitat specialist confined to meadows, whereas L. sinapis is a habitat generalist also inhabiting forests. This difference in habitat utilization was corroborated by experimental release of laboratory-reared L. sinapis and L. reali in two adjacent forest and meadow habitats during their natural flight period; virtually all recaptured L. reali that were released in the forest were later caught in the meadow, whereas L. sinapis shifted equally often from meadow to forest as in the opposite direction. In the field, both species fly in May-June, but L. reali appears on average a week earlier in spring and has a substantial second generation in July, whereas L. sinapis is practically univoltine. When overwintered pupae were incubated under identical conditions in the laboratory, females did, however, not differ in phenology, and L. sinapis males actually emerged earlier than L. reali males. When larvae were reared at 23 degrees C on the host plant Lotus corniculatus at a range of daylengths, both species produced a substantial proportion of directly developing individuals at an 18.5 h daylength or longer. When reared at 23 degrees C and a 22 h daylength, L. reali showed an overall higher propensity to develop directly than L. sinapis on plant species originating from both the meadow and the forest habitat. Both Leptidea species showed a lower propensity to enter direct development on forest associated plants than on meadow associated plants. Hence, we suggest that the difference in phenology and voltinism between L. sinapis and L. reali is largely the result of environmentally implemented ecological pleiotropic effects caused by the between-species difference in habitat preference.

Genetic population structure and hybridization in two sibling species, Tomoplagia reticulata and Tomoplagia pallens (Diptera: Tephritidae)	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH												Tomoplagia reticulata and T. pallens are sibling species that are specialists on Eremanthus glomerulatus. Besides adult terminalia, they show slight morphological differences and distinct geographic distributions. Once, however, they were found sympatrically. Using data from allozyme and mtDNA, we examined patterns of intra- and interspecific genetic structure, and investigated the possible occurrence of gene flow between them. Both species showed low diversity and high genetic structure, which can be linked to their high degree of specialization. Larval development occurs within flower heads, tissues that are available only during a short period of the year. Afterward, as they do not hibernate, they probably suffer a great reduction in population size, which leads to low genetic diversity. As monophagous insects, their population structure may correspond to the fragmented distribution of E. glomerulatus, which could isolate fly populations and increase inbreeding within them. One population exhibited a mixed genetic composition, compatible with one hybridization season when species were sympatric. This hybridization seems to be a rare event, due to T. pallens unusual range expansion.

J	Pritchard, G				Pritchard, Gordon			The life history of a temperate zone dragonfly living at the edge of its range with comments on the colonization of high latitudes by Neotropical genera of Zygoptera (Odonata)	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ODONATOLOGY												Of the many Zygopteran genera that occur in the Neotropics, only five (Hetaerina, Archilestes, Lestes, Argia, and Ischnura) are represented north of 40 degrees N in North America, and only three of these (Hetaerina, Ambilestes, and Argia) probably had a tropical origin. In the two genera of Lestidae (Arcbilestes and Lestes) the life history of temperate-zone populations is usually regulated by an egg diapause, whereas in the two genera of Coenagrionidae (Argia and Ischnura) larval diapause synchronizes life histories with seasonal temperature changes. This paper presents data on the life history of a northern population of a species in the first genus, Hetaerina americana living in a geothermally influenced stream near to the northern edge of the species' range in western North America. Larval growth is affected by temperature and differs between warmer and cooler years, but generally larvae appear to grow very rapidly during summer and even grow over winter. Two peaks of larval recruitment each year and a decrease in final stadium size over the summer may be evidence for bi-voltinism, and the absence of final stadium larvae in October, November, and December indicates a short-day regulatory diapause in F-I larvae. A long-day diapause which prevents autumnal metamorphosis of larvae appears not to be present. It is not known whether the tactics that allow New World species of Zygoptera to survive at mid- to high-temperate latitudes are also present in their tropical congeneric relatives, but it does appear that diapause expression has been associated with speciation in the temperate zone.																	1388-7890						2008	11	2					209	223		10.1080/13887890.2008.9748324								WOS:000259479200006

Larvae were reared under different photoperiods ranging from 8L16D to 16L8D at 20 +/- 0.5 degrees C. The critical photoperiods for pupal diapause induction were 14 h 40 min for the Iwamizawa population (43 degrees 10'N), 13 h 15 min For the Sendai population (38 degrees 15'N), 13 h 10 min for the Nagaoka population (37 degrees 23'N), 12 h 08 min for the Okayama population (34 degrees 39'N), 11 h 50 min For the Matsuyama (33 degrees 50'N) and Kagoshima (31 degrees 35'N) populations and I I h 15 min for the Naze population (28 degrees 23'N). The critical photoperiod increases as latitude increases. This result Suggests that adaptation to a cool climate in a higher latitude region shifts the critical photoperiod for pupal diapause induction towards a longer range. The developmental zero for the larval stage in the Sapporo (43 degrees 03'N) and Matsuyama populations was calculated as 9.8 degrees C and 9.6 degrees C for the larval stage, respectively. These results are discussed in relation to seasonal adaptation for each population.																	0021-4914						2008	52	4					201	206		10.1303/jjaez.2008.201								WOS:000262760300003

Development of the khapra beetle, Trogoderma granarium, in the lower part of its temperature range	JOURNAL OF STORED PRODUCTS RESEARCH												The lower temperature limit for breeding of the khapra beetle, Trogoderma granarium,, was determined at constant temperatures in the laboratory. The length of female adult life, oviposition, egg incubation period and duration of larval plus pupal development were observed at 25, 22.5, 20 and 17.2 degrees C, respectively, at 70% r.h. The results show that breeding is slow at 25 degrees, very slow at 22.5 degrees and populations decline at 20 degrees C and below. Thus cooling of produce to 20 degrees C and retention at or below this temperature is a sound, safe, environmental friendly method for control of this pest. For newly dried malted barley, the results indicate that cooling to 25 degrees C would be sufficient to prevent T granarium populations from reaching levels of economic importance.

The reproductive ecology of Mohave rattlesnakes	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												The reproductive ecology of Mohave rattlesnakes Crotalus scutulatus was investigated in the western Mohave Desert using radiotelemetry from August 2001 to November 2004. This paper documents reproductive behavior across successive seasons in the context of seasonal timing, mean daily movement, home range, body temperature and relationship with abiotic factors such as time of day, temperature, precipitation, photoperiod and microhabitat. This population of C. scutulatus used a bimodal mating system, with reproductive behavior occurring in late summer/fall (21 August to 7 October), interrupted by 4 months of cold weather, and concluding in the spring (16 March to 16 May). Drought apparently curtailed courtship and copulation during the 2002 activity season, but the pregnancy rates in 2002 and 2003 were not significantly affected. Communal denning was not detected and there was no indication of seasonal migration. Autumnal and vernal movements appeared to be driven by reproductive effort, predominantly males engaged in prolonged mate searching. Sexual maturity was achieved at 2.0 years/600 mm snout-vent length (SVL) for females, and 1.5 years/400 mm SVL for males.																	0952-8369					JAN	2008	274	1					65	76		10.1111/j.1469-7998.2007.00358.x								WOS:000251739900011

Whereas beech is the only host plant for R. fagi, the polyphagous defoliator L. dispar can switch to a wide range of plant species in case a resource is exhausted or less suited. In the present study we address the issue whether or not the induced response of beech leaves caused by R. fagi will decrease their nutritional quality for gypsy moth larvae. R. fagi adults perform typical feeding holes of about 2-3 mm in diameter at two terms in the season: (1) after hibernation and prior to oviposition in early spring and (2) as new generation weevils at the end of May. Larvae mine the leaves starting with a gallery close to a leaf nerve. The mine is enlarged when it reaches the leaf edge where pupation occurs. The intact part of the leaf remains turgescent and vital. The wide range of host plants of gypsy moth includes Fagus sylvatica, too. R. fagi-mined leaves of beech were fed to larvae of L. dispar in two experiments. (1) L4-larvae of L. dispar forced to feed R. fagi-mined leaves in no-choice experiments showed a reduced weight gain compared to conspecifics on control leaves. (2) In choice experiments gypsy moth larvae of the same stage preferred control (non-mined) leaves over R. fagi-mined leaves. The results are discussed as a strategy of specialists to protect its ecological niche against a generalist mediated by the induced response elicited by the specialist.																	0344-9084						2008	16						273	276										WOS:000262472800043

Genetic response to rapid climate change: it's seasonal timing that matters	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY					International Summit on Evolutionary Change in Human-Altered Environments	FEB 08-10, 2007	Inst Environm, Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA		Inst Environm, Univ Calif Los Angeles			The primary nonbiological result of recent rapid climate change is warming winter temperatures, particularly at northern latitudes, leading to longer growing seasons and new seasonal exigencies and opportunities. Biological responses reflect selection due to the earlier arrival of spring, the later arrival of fall, or the increasing length of the growing season. Animals from rotifers to rodents use the high reliability of day length to time the seasonal transitions in their life histories that are crucial to fitness in temperate and polar environments: when to begin developing in the spring, when to reproduce, when to enter dormancy or when to migrate, thereby exploiting favourable temperatures and avoiding unfavourable temperatures. In documented cases of evolutionary (genetic) response to recent, rapid climate change, the role of day length (photoperiodism) ranges from causal to inhibitory; in no case has there been demonstrated a genetic shift in thermal optima or thermal tolerance. More effort should be made to explore the role of photoperiodism in genetic responses to climate change and to rule out the role of photoperiod in the timing of seasonal life histories before thermal adaptation is assumed to be the major evolutionary response to climate change.																	0962-1083					JAN	2008	17	1					157	166		10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03509.x								WOS:000251740500013	17850269

Selection on domestication traits and quantitative trait loci in crop-wild sunflower hybrids	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												The strength and extent of gene flow from crops into wild populations depends, in part, on the fitness of the crop alleles, as well as that of alleles at linked loci. Interest in crop-wild gene flow has increased with the advent of transgenic plants, but nontransgenic crop-wild hybrids can provide case studies to understand the factors influencing introgression, provided that the genetic architecture and the fitness effects of loci are known. This study used recombinant inbred lines (RILs) generated from a cross between crop and wild sunflowers to assess selection on domestication traits and quantitative trait loci (QTL) in two contrasting environments, in Indiana and Nebraska, USA. Only a small fraction of plants (9%) produced seed in Nebraska, due to adverse weather conditions, while the majority of plants (79%) in Indiana reproduced. Phenotypic selection analysis found that a mixture of crop and wild traits were favoured in Indiana (i.e. had significant selection gradients), including larger leaves, increased floral longevity, larger disk diameter, reduced ray flower size and smaller achene (seed) mass. Selection favouring early flowering was detected in Nebraska. QTLs for fitness were found at the end of linkage groups six (LG6) and nine (LG9) in both field sites, each explaining 11-12% of the total variation. Crop alleles were favoured on LG9, but wild alleles were favoured on LG6. QTLs for numerous domestication traits overlapped with the fitness QTLs, including flowering date, achene mass, head number, and disk diameter. It remains to be seen if these QTL clusters are the product of multiple linked genes, or individual genes with pleiotropic effects. These results indicate that crop trait values and alleles may sometimes be favoured in a noncrop environment and across broad geographical regions.

Association mapping for photoperiod insensitivity trait in soybean	NATIONAL ACADEMY SCIENCE LETTERS-INDIA												Association mapping is a new approach for confirming the marker/trait association in an independent Population that leads to a better understanding of the genetic basis of complex traits. In the present study an effort was made to identify chromosomal segments associated with photoperiod insensitivity using association mapping approach in the soybean genotypes of diverse origin and differing in response to photoperiod sensitivity, which is an important trait in the adaptation of soybean to higher latitudinal environment. These genotypes were analyzed using SSR markers and marker data collected from all lines were subjected to control for population structure and kinship relationships. The results of both the above analyses along with the phenotypic data were used to establish marker-trait association by general linear model (GLM) using TASSEL. Association mapping identified five SSR markers, Satt231, Satt411, Satt489, Satt276 and Satt434 significantly associated with photoperiod insensitivity in soybean at R(2)-Model> 0.6 and P-Marker <= 0.01 and explaining 15.8%, 18.7%, 10.1%, 9.98% and 11.9% of the trait variations, respectively. The results suggest that marker trait associations can be readily detected in a population of diverse origin with differences in response to the trait. These associated markers after validation in large population can be used in MAS for improvement of photoperiod insensitivity trait in soybean.																	0250-541X						2008	31	9-10					281	283										WOS:000261852000004

Timing of breeding in tropical birds: Mechanisms and evolutionary implications	ORNITOLOGIA NEOTROPICAL					8th Neotropical Ornithological Congress	MAY 13-19, 2007	Maturin, VENEZUELA					Appropriate timing of breeding is an important component of reproductive success for almost all animals world-wide that live in seasonally fluctuating environments. A precise temporal regulation of reproduction is achieved by intricate physiological processes that sense variations in environmental conditions, integrate them with internal information and regulate the reproductive state accordingly. Most of our knowledge of the physiology underlying avian reproductive strategies has come from studies in temperate zone species. These studies have highlighted the physiological adaptations that species possess to regulate reproduction in environments with regular seasonal fluctuations in abiotic and biotic conditions. However, in other parts of the world, for example at tropical latitudes, variations in environmental conditions often occur in different patterns and regularity than at higher latitudes. The fascinating avian diversity in the tropics provides us with the unique opportunity to investigate the physiological mechanisms that form the basis of animal-environment interactions, to better understand how these physiological systems evolve. Here we summarize recent findings on the reproductive physiology and timing of reproduction in tropical birds, focusing on near-equatorial tropical species. We discuss variations in breeding strategies, responses to environmental cues and the functioning of the neuroendocrine reproductive axis in various avian species living in diverse tropical habitats. We then interpret these data in an evolutionary context to suggest future fines of research. Our understanding of the evolution of the timing of breeding and its underlying physiology in birds is still rudimentary, but we expect that studies on tropical species can play a major role in making substantial progress on these issues.

Gibberellins are commercially produced by fermentation of natural fungus, Gibberella fujikuroi. The most commonly used Gibberellic acid, GA(3), is primarily formulated as solutions (2 to 5% in isopropyl alcohol, 10% in methyl alcohol), as 5 to 20% wettable or soluble powders, or both, as 3.1% soluble granules or as 1 to 10-g effervescent tablets. The other frequently used gibberellins, GA(41.7), are primarily formulated as 1 to 4% solutions either in tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA) or in propylene glycol. Of the solvents currently used, isopropyl alcohol and methyl alcohol offer severe disadvantages such as flammability, toxicity, and restrictions in manufacturing, packaging, labeling, transportation, and warehousing. The THFA used in some of the formulations is considered corrosive to the eye and skin. Low solubility of gibberellins in propylene glycol does not permit solution formulations with greater than 2% wt/wt gibberellins. The powder formulations are not user friendly and require quite a long time to achieve true solubility of the active component in tank mixes. Due to low solubility and undesirable hydrolysis, it has not been possible to formulate gibberellins in aqueous systems. This paper will present formulation studies leading to the development of stable, high potency (GA(3) at 40% wt/wt and higher; GA(41.7) at 10% wt/wt and higher), dust free, instantly water wettable, dispersible, and soluble Gibberellin plant growth regulator granular formulations by low pressure extrusion methodology. Field biological efficacy studies on grapes showed concentrated water soluble granular formulation either equivalent or superior to the standard powder formutation.																	0066-0558		978-0-8031-4498-9				2008	1500						3	+		10.1520/STP47500S								WOS:000257884000001

Seed predation on Allagoptera arenaria (Gomes) O'Kuntze, 1891(Arecaceae) palm by Pachymerus nucleorum Fabricius, 1972 was evaluated from September 2003 to September 2005 at the Parque Nacional da Restinga de Jurubatiba (PNRJ), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The biology and behaviour of P nucleorum on A. arenaria and predation rates were described. Fruits found beneath 50 palms were collected, monthly, for each one of the two sampled areas at PNRJ (ridge forest and Clusia Sclthdl (Clusiaceae) open shrubland formation). The evaluation of preyed fruits was done by counting exit holes of Bruchinae in the field, the emergence of these insects in the laboratory and from fruits dissected. It was verified that Pachymerus nucleorum oviposit on young developing infrutescences, different from literature records for other palm species, for which oviposition takes place on the fruit already on the ground. Fruit predation by R nucleorum was 29.3% at ridge forest and 20.6% at Clusia open shrubland formation. The life cycle of P. nucleorum was long and with wide range of variation within samples, what suggests a possible diapause in some stage of life cycle.

Movement and growth of Neonate Eastern Massasaugas (Sistrurus catenatus)	COPEIA												Throughout the geographic range, adult Eastern Massasaugas (Sistrurus catenatus) exhibit plasticity in movement, fecundity, diet, and activity range size; however, the ecology of subadults remains unknown. We attached radio transmitters to 16 free-ranging neonate S. catenatus and monitored their movements and growth for up to 56 days prior to their initial hibernation. Neonate movement frequency (70%) was consistent with values reported for adults throughout the geographic range, but activity range size (0.36 ha) and mean daily distance moved (5.3 m) were smaller. Males gained significantly more mass than females over the first 50 days, but no difference in length was detected. Neonate S. catenatus returned to their general birthing area to overwinter. Because of ontogenetic shifts and differences in the spatial distribution of resources, regionally-specific management plans based on data for all age classes are essential in providing effective conservation measures.																	0045-8511	1938-5110				DEC 28	2007		4					994	1000		10.1643/0045-8511(2007)7[994:MAGONE]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000252100300021						
J	Kurota, H; Shimada, M				Kurota, Hiroyuki; Shimada, Masakazu			Over-wintering stage polymorphism of a bruchine beetle: geographical variation in optimal diapause strategy	ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												1. Most temperate insects undergo diapause at a specific developmental stage to overcome severe winters. The bruchine beetle Bruchidius dorsalis in a warmer region in Japan, however, has diverse over-wintering stages-non-diapausing larvae, diapausing larvae, and diapausing adults, whereas in a cooler region, it over-winters only as the final instar larva or adult in diapause. 2. The geographical pattern of over-wintering stages in 12 populations was investigated over a wide range along the mainland of Japan. It revealed that a distinct geographical pattern of over-wintering stages exists in relation to temperature conditions. In regions with warmer climates, the proportion of non-diapausing larvae increased and B. dorsalis had a more complex over-wintering stage structure. 3. Life cycles were also compared between two areas of Japan by field experiments. In the cooler area, the first generation over-wintered in the diapausing larval or adult stage. Conversely, in the warmer area, diapause was induced later and some of the first-generation adults produced second-generation offspring before over-wintering. 4. Based on the geographical cline of climates and the differences in cold hardiness among stages, we can demonstrate that the over-wintering stage variation among and within populations results from an adaptive timing of diapause induction in each region, because the late larval or adult diapauses protect pupae or eggs-which unlike other stages are not cold hardy-from being produced late in the season.

Maesen and S. Almeida. Adults of G. tredecimmaculata were ovoviviparous and reproduced throughout the summer, producing offspring that had an obligate adult diapause. In no-choice tests, adult and larval G. tredecimmaculata rejected most of the plant species tested, but consumed foliage and completed their life cycle on soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) and on a native woodland plant, hog-peanut (Amphicarpaea bracteata L. Fernald), which are in the same subtribe as kudzu (Glycininae). Insects showed similar responses to field- and greenhouse-grown soybean and kudzu foliage, despite measurable differences in leaf traits: field-grown foliage of both plants had greater leaf toughness, higher total carbon content, higher trichome density, and lower water content than greenhouse foliage. O. trifidus adults also rejected most of the plants tested but fed on and severely damaged potted soybean and hog-peanut plants in addition to kudzu. Further tests in China are needed to determine whether these species will accept nontarget host plants under open-field conditions.																	0046-225X					DEC	2007	36	6					1430	1440		10.1603/0046-225X(2007)36[1430:BAPHRA]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000252060700015	18284771

Adaptive population differentiation in phenology across a latitudinal gradient in European Aspen (Populus tremula, L.): A comparison of neutral markers, candidate genes and phenotypic traits	EVOLUTION												A correct timing of growth cessation and dormancy induction represents a critical ecological and evolutionary trade-off between survival and growth in most forest trees (Rehfeldt et al. 1999; Horvath et al. 2003; Howe et al. 2003). We have studied the deciduous tree European Aspen (Populus tremula) across a latitudinal gradient and compared genetic differentiation in phenology traits with molecular markers. Trees from 12 different areas covering 10 latitudinal degrees were cloned and planted in two common gardens. Several phenology traits showed strong genetic differentiation and clinal variation across the latitudinal gradient, with Q(ST) values generally exceeding 0.5. This is in stark contrast to genetic differentiation at several classes of genetic markers (18 neutral SSRs, 7 SSRs located close to phenology candidate genes and 50 SNPs from five phenology candidate genes) that all showed F-ST values around 0.015. We thus find strong evidence for adaptive divergence in phenology traits across the latitudinal gradient. However, the strong population structure seen at the quantitative traits is not reflected in underlying candidate genes. This result fit theoretical expectations that suggest that genetic differentiation at candidate loci is better described by F-ST at neutral loci rather than by Q(ST) at the quantitative traits themselves.

Changes in habitat use and movement patterns with body size in black ratsnakes (Elaphe obsoleta)	HERPETOLOGICA												Many animals exhibit pronounced shifts in ecology (e.g., habitat use, diet) as they grow. The central goal of this study was to determine whether habitat use and movement patterns of juvenile black ratsnakes (Elaphe obsoleta) differed from patterns previously documented for adult ratsnakes and to determine the conservation implications of any changes identified. We found a shift in habitat rise by black ratsnakes with body size; juveniles used macrohabitats and microhabitats in proportion to their availability, unlike adult black ratsnakes that have been shown to prefer forest edges at both scales. Frequency of movement declined with body size, whereas distance traveled per move increased with body size. Habitat selection and movement patterns may be a result of ontogenetic shifts in thermoregulatory behaviour associated with changes in body size, or alternatively, may reflect size-related variation in predation risk. Home range size and fidelity, and fidelity to hibernacula all increased with body size. Despite ontogenetic changes in habitat use and movement by ratsnakes, recommendations regarding critical habitat for adults of this species should be adequate to protect juveniles.																	0018-0831	1938-5099				DEC	2007	63	4					421	429		10.1655/0018-0831(2007)63[421:CIHUAM]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000252203700002

Temperature-dependent post-diapause development and prediction of spring emergence of the pine needle gall midge (Dipt., Cecidomyiidae)	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY												We determined the influence of temperature on post-diapause development of overwintered Thecodiplosis japonensis Uchida et Inouye (Dipt., Cecidomyiidae) under various treatments (12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27 and 30 degrees C) in an effort to predict its spring emergence. Survival and developmental period for the overwintered larvae and pupae were significantly influenced by temperature. Linear and nonlinear regression models quantitatively described temperature-dependent development and survival of T. japonensis. The survival models exhibited right-skewed bell shape patterns for all stages, indicating a more detrimental impact on survival at high temperatures. Theoretical optimum temperatures with highest survival were 22.3, 24.0 and 24.0 degrees C for the overwintered larvae, pupae and total post-diapause development (the larvae to adults) respectively. Pupal mortality was higher at all temperatures than larval mortality and the suitable range of temperature for pupae was narrower than that of larvae. The nonlinear Briere model estimated that optimum temperatures with the fastest development were 29.1 degrees C for larvae, 27.6 degrees C for pupae and 27.0 degrees C for larvae to adults. In a linear model, the lower threshold temperatures were 5.1, 7.1 and 5.9 degrees C for larvae, pupae, and larvae to adults respectively. A predictive degree-day model was developed using trap catches of T. japonensis adult emergence during 1991-1995. The model accounted for 84.6% of year-to-year variation in adult emergence and predicted accurately the median emergence time in 1996.																	0931-2048					DEC	2007	131	9-10					674	683		10.1111/j.1439-0418.2007.01214.x								WOS:000251193300012						
J	Coppack, T				Coppack, Timothy			Experimental determination of the photoperiodic basis for geographic variation in avian seasonality	JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												Geographic variation in the timing of breeding, moult and migration of birds reflects adjustment of their annual cycles to regional differences in environmental conditions. Understanding to what degree this variation results from phenotypic plasticity or from genetic adaptation is important both as a goal of primary research and especially because we need to understand the potential for species to adapt to global environmental change. The annual change in day-length remains invariant, year after year, and birds depend primarily on this environmental information to match breeding and migration schedules with the changing seasons. Here, I review what is known about the role of photoperiodic responses in shaping geographic variation in avian life cycles, focussing on intra-specific comparative studies in passerine birds. Experiments with hand-raised individuals from different populations kept under identical conditions (common-garden experiments) suggest that differences in the timing of events are not photoperiodically determined when trait differences persist. A single common-garden experiment has no neutral testing ground, however. Thus, if birds breeding at different latitudes have evolved (or retained) non-parallel reaction norms, a single test environment is not sufficient to quantify genetic and environmental influences. While reciprocal transplantation may control for this problem, such an extended experimental design has only rarely been considered. More recently, population-specific reaction norms have been studied by assigning full siblings to various photoperiodic regimes. Through this approach, the extent of genotype-by-environment interaction can be estimated, which is essential information when interpreting trait differences among populations under natural conditions and predicting how species or populations will respond to photoperiodic conditions outside present-day geographical ranges.

J	MacDougall-Shackleton, SA; Hahn, TP				MacDougall-Shackleton, Scott A.; Hahn, Thomas P.			Adaptation and evolution of photoperiod response systems in birds	JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												The reproductive cycle of most birds is driven by the annual change in photoperiod, with birds cycling between the physiological states of photosensitivity, photostimulation and photorefractoriness. Comparative studies show that variation in breeding schedules is often correlated with variation in photoperiod response systems. We caution, however, that before adaptive specialization of photoperiod response systems can be concluded, the effects of conditional plasticity and phylogenetic history need to be considered. Conditional plasticity can result in birds with identical response systems displaying different breeding schedules at different latitudes. Consideration of phylogeny can reveal whether parameters of response systems are derived adaptations or ancestral traits. Comparative data on photorefractoriness suggests that one criterion for absolute photorefractoriness-spontaneous regression of the gonads on constant long days-is ancestral in the songbirds. Only four species lack this form of photorefractoriness and all of them are opportunistic breeders. A second criterion for absolute photorefractoriness is insensitivity to even 24 h light when birds are refractory. In contrast to spontaneous regression of the gonads, the distribution of this second criterion across species does not support an adaptive hypothesis. In cardueline finches, a lack of photorefractoriness by this second criterion is widespread and is present even among strictly seasonal breeders. Further exploration of the evolution and adaptation of photoperiod responses will require measuring the response of each species to a range of photoperiods and interpreting results within a phylogenetic context.

Fire disturbance and forest structure in old-growth mixed conifer forests in the northern Sierra Nevada, California	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question: This study evaluates how fire regimes influence stand structure and dynamics in old-growth mixed conifer forests across a range of environmental settings. Location: A 2000-ha area of mixed conifer forest on the west shore of Lake Tahoe in the northern Sierra Nevada, California. Methods: We quantified the age, size, and spatial structure of trees in 12 mixed conifer stands distributed across major topographic gradients. Fire history was reconstructed in each stand using fire scar dendrochronology. The influence of fire on stand structure was assessed by comparing the fire history with the age, size, and spatial structure of trees in a stand. Results: There was significant variation in species composition among stands, but not in the size, age and spatial patterning of trees. Stands had multiple size and age classes with clusters of similar aged trees occurring at scales of 113-254 m(2). The frequency and severity of fires was also similar, and stands burned with low to moderate severity in the dormant season on average every 9 - 17 years. Most fires were not synchronized among stands except in very dry years. No fires have burned since ca. 1880. Conclusions: Fire and forest structure interact to perpetuate similar stand characteristics across a range of environmental settings. Fire occurrence is controlled primarily by spatial variation in fuel mosaics (e.g. patterns of abundance, fuel moisture, forest structure), but regional drought synchronizes fire in some years. Fire exclusion over the last 120 years has caused compositional and structural shifts in these mixed conifer forests.

Selective control of these plants, although desirable, is complicated by the shared physiology and phenology of the invader and the native components of the invaded plant community. Fortunately, there is evidence that some management practices, such as prescribed fire, herbicide, and mowing, can cause differential responses in native and invasive grassland species. However, timing of treatment is critical, and fire has been shown to increase rates of invasion when implemented during the dormant season. Bothriochloa ischaemum, an introduced C4 Eurasian grass is an increasing problem in grasslands, particularly in southern and central regions of North America. To date, there has been little success in effective selective control. Two invaded grassland sites representative of Blackland Prairie and Edwards Plateau ecoregions were subjected to two growing-season prescribed fire treatments, single and double herbicide applications, and single and double mowing treatments. Mowing had no effect on either B. ischaemum or other dominant species at either site one-year posttreatment. However, growing-season fire and herbicide were both effective at reducing the abundance of B. ischaemum, with other codominant species responding either negatively to herbicide or neutrally or positively to fire. The vulnerability of B. ischaemum to growing-season fire may be associated with the ecology of its native range. The negative growth response to growing-season fire, combined with its lower implementation costs, indicates that this method warrants further investigation as a selective management tool for other problematic species in invaded grasslands.																	1061-2971					DEC	2007	15	4					662	669		10.1111/j.1526-100X.2007.00278.x								WOS:000251555300009

Consequences of thermal acclimation for the mating behaviour and swimming performance of female mosquito fish	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												The mating system of eastern mosquito fish ( Gambusia holbrooki) is dominated by male sexual coercion, where all matings are forced and females never appear to cooperate and actively avoid all attempts. Previous research has shown that male G. holbrooki offer a model system for examining the benefits of reversible thermal acclimation for reproductive success, but examining the benefits to female avoidance behaviour has been difficult. In this study, we examined the ability of non-male-deprived female G. holbrooki to avoid forced-coercive matings following acclimation to either 18 or 30 degrees C for six weeks ( 12 h light : 12 h dark photoperiod). Thermal acclimation of burst and sustained swimming performance was also assessed, as these traits are likely to underlie their ability to avoid forced matings. There was no influence of thermal acclimation on the burst swimming performance of female G. holbrooki over the range 18-30 degrees C; however, sustained swimming performance was significantly lower in the warm-than the cool-acclimation group. For mating behaviour, we tested the hypothesis that acclimation would enhance the ability of female G. holbrooki to avoid forced matings at their host acclimation temperature relative to females acclimated to another environment. However, our hypothesis was not supported. The rate of copulations was almost three times greater for females acclimated to 30 degrees C than 18 degrees Cwhen tested at 30 degrees C, indicating that they possess the ability to alter their avoidance behaviour to 'allow' more copulations in some environments. Coupled with previous studies, female G. holbrooki appear to have greater control on the outcome of coercive mating attempts than previously considered and can alter their propensity to receive forced matings following thermal acclimation. The significance of this change in female mating-avoidance behaviours with thermal acclimation remains to be explored.

Conceptual model of seagrass die-off in Florida Bay: Links to biogeochemical processes	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Seagrasses are recognized as important plant communities in coastal estuaries and lagoons across both tropical and temperate climes; thus, large-scale seagrass die-off events worldwide are of general concern. In Florida Bay, at the southern terminus of the Florida peninsula, seagrass die-off events up to 4000 ha have been reported and smaller scale mortality events are noted annually. In the present study, we examined several hypothesized causative factors (high temperature, hypersalinity, sulfide toxicity) of seagrass (Thalassia testudinum) mortality in Florida Bay. To test sulfide effects, in situ sulfide production was stimulated by applying a labile carbon source (glucose) to sulfate reducers in the sediment at five sites across the bay (northeastern, northcentral, and southwestern basins). During the one year study, high temperature (32-36 degrees C) and salinity (>50 psu) were recorded in the bay associated with a regional drought. We also experienced major seagrass die-off events at two of our southwestern bay sites. These field conditions provided an excellent opportunity to closely examine cause-effect relationships among stressors and die-off events in the field, and verify results of our previous mesocosm experiments. Even though glucose amendments stimulated porewater sulfides in bay sediments (4-8 mmol L-1), no significant differences in biomass, short shoot density or final growth rates were found between control and glucose plots. In addition, the highest growth rates and shoot densities were concomitant with maximum water column salinity (>50 psu) and temperature (32-36 degrees C, when porewater sulfides were also in the millimolar range. Large-scale seagrass mortality events, encompassing similar to 50% of the entire meadow at one site, occurred at southwestern bay sites when plants were down regulating (slower growth and shoot density), probably in response to shorter day length and lower temperature (30-34 to 23-26 degrees C) from October, 2004 to January, 2005. Sulfate reduction rates (SRR) were also 2-fold higher in the southwestern (214-488 nmol cm(-3) d(-1)) versus northcentral and northeastern (97-240 nmol cm(-3) d(-1)) bay sites, possibly limited by labile carbon, which we found to stimulate SRR 3-fold in northeastern and northcentral bay sites (461-708 nmol cm(-3) d(-1)) and 4-fold at southwestern bay sites (1211-2036 nmol cm(-3) d(-1)). Based on a synthesis of the field data reported herein, our mesocosm experiments to date, and contributions by others, we present a conceptual model of seagrass die-off in Florida Bay outlining a cascade of stressors, stimulated by P enrichment, which leads to high 02 consumption in the system triggering a seagrass die-off event.

ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Land snails often exhibit intra-annual cycles of activity interspersed by periods of dormancy (hibernation/aestivation), accompanied by a range of behavioural and physiological adaptations to ensure their survival under adverse environmental conditions. These adaptations are useful to understand species-specific habitat requirements and to predict their response to environmental changes. We examined the seasonal physiological and biochemical composition patterns of the threatened land snail Codringtonia helenae, endemic to Greece, in relation to its behavioural ecology and climatic conditions. Fuel reserves (glycogen, lipids, proteins) and water were accumulated prior to aestivation, but subsequently were rapidly depleted. LDH exhibited substantial rise during aestivation, suggesting that anaerobic pathways may provide additional energy. The major outcome of our study was the unambiguous discrimination of the four life-cycle periods. Most remarkable was the clear distinction of the aestivation period, with hibernation, the other dormancy period, showing similarity with the two active periods but not with aestivation. We observed disassociation between behavioural and physiological responses and climatic conditions. The physiological responses of C. helenae were effective during hibernation, but only partly compensate the effect of adverse conditions during aestivation, since its aestivating behaviour is occasional and time limited. Perhaps, the behavioural ecology of Codringtonia is relictual and shaped during past environmental conditions. This constitutes an important extinction threat considering the current climatic trends and the deterioration of the habitat of that species due to human activities. (c) 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Mechanisms limiting the geographical range of the parasitic weed Orobanche crenata	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Factors and mechanisms limiting the geographical range of the root parasitic plant Orobanche crenata (crenate broomrape) were investigated and the risk of a spread beyond its current distribution area was assessed. Information on distribution and ecophysiology of O. crenata was gathered from literature and laboratory studies. A simulation model of seedbank dynamics served to test hypotheses and identify risk areas. The geographical range of O. crenata is strongly affected by mechanisms acting on the seedbank. Relevant processes include seed conditioning, germination, loss of viability, and dormancy induction and release. These are driven by the dynamics of soil temperature and moisture, and the presence or absence of hosts. Populations of O. crenata can only establish where a distinct precipitation seasonality prevails, with a warm and dry period being followed by warm and wet conditions, and where the presence of conditioned seeds coincides with that of a host. Climatically suitable regions include all Mediterranean climate areas and part of the monsoon, savanna and winter-dry climate regions of Central America, Africa, Australia and South Asia. In humid areas, both temperate and tropical, preponderance of dormancy-inducing wet conditions and lack of a warm-dry period facilitating dormancy release prevent the completion of the O. crenata life cycle and thus establishment of the species.

Long-term patterns of sleeping site use in wild saddleback (Saguinus fuscicollis) and Mustached Tamarins (S-mystax): Effects of foraging, thermoregulation, predation, and resource defense constraints	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY												Sleeping sites are an important aspect of an animal's ecology given the length of time that they spend in them. The sleep ecology of wild saddleback and mustached tamarins is examined using a long-term data set covering three mixed-species troops and 1,300+ tamarin nights. Seasonal changes in photoperiod accounted for a significant amount of variation in sleeping site entry and exit times. Time of exit was more closely correlated with sunrise than time of entry was with sunset. Both species entered their sleeping sites when light levels were significantly higher than when they left them in the morning. Troops of both species used >80 individual sites, the majority being used once. Mustached tamarins never used the same site for more than two consecutive nights, but saddlebacks reused the same site for up to four consecutive nights. Mustached tamarins slept at significantly greater heights than saddleback tamarins. There were consistent interspecific differences in the types of sites used. Neither the presence of infants, season, nor rainfall affected the types or heights of sites chosen. Sleeping sites were located in the central area of exclusive use more often than expected, and their position with respect to fruiting trees indicated a strategy closer to that of a multiple central place forager than a central place forager. These findings are discussed in light of species ecology, with particular reference to predation risk, which is indicated as the major factor influencing the pattern of sleeping site use in these species.

Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol 293: H2945-H2951, 2007. First published August 24, 2007; doi:10.1152/ajpheart.00012.2007. - Within hibernating myocardium, it is uncertain whether a normal energetic state is present at baseline and whether maintaining that energy state during a catecholamine challenge is dependent on ATP-dependent potassium channel opening. In this study, 16 swine underwent a thoracotomy with placement of an external constrictor on the left anterior descending coronary artery ( LAD) ( hibernation model). Seven additional swine underwent a sham operation. At 10 wk, the myocardial energetic state in the LAD region was assessed by P-31-NMR spectroscopy, and the ratio of phosphocreatine to ATP (PCr/ATP) was determined at baseline, during glibenclamide treatment (0.5 mg/kg bolus with 50 mu g/min iv), and during addition of dobutamine ( 40 mu g (.) kg(-1) (.) min(-1) iv). At baseline, transmural blood flow in the LAD and remote region was 0.75 +/- 0.11 and 0.88 +/- 0.09 ml (.) min(-1) mu g(-1), respectively ( P < 0.01), in hibernating hearts and 0.83 +/- 0.12 and 0.88 +/- 0.15 ml (.) min(-1) (.) g(-1), respectively ( not significant), in sham-operated hearts. Under basal conditions, PCr/ATP in the LAD region of hibernating and sham pigs was 2.15 +/- 0.04 and 2.11 +/- 0.05, respectively ( not significant). In sham pigs, addition of dobutamine to glibenclamide increased the double product from 10.4 +/- 0.8 to 23.9 +/- 4.0 mmHg (.) beats (.) min(-1) x 1,000 ( P < 0.05) and decreased transmural PCr/ATP from 2.06 +/- 0.06 to 1.69 +/- 0.06 ( P < 0.05). Dobutamine increased the double product in hibernating pigs in a similar fashion and, despite a 40% lower blood flow response, induced an equivalent decrease in PCr/ATP from 2.04 +/- 0.04 to 1.73 +/- 0.08 ( P < 0.05). In conclusion, we found that, in chronic hibernating swine myocardium with reduced basal blood flow and perfusion reserve, the transmural energetic state, defined by PCr/ATP, is normal during addition of dobutamine, despite inhibition of ATP-dependent potassium channel opening with glibenclamide. These data suggest that important adaptations other than the ATP-dependent potassium channel opening allow hibernating myocardium to operate over a lower range of the oxygen supply-demand relationship to protect against myocardial ischemia.

In addition, changes in parasitism levels of the cabbage seedpod weevil, Ceutorhynchus obstrictus (Marsham) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), by N. tidius were determined during 2003-2005 in commercial fields of canola (Brassica rapa L. and Brassica napus L.) in southern Alberta and Saskatchewan, Canada. Mean +/- SE developmental time from egg to adult was 18.3 +/- 0.23d for specimens reared at 21 degrees C and a photoperiod of 12:12 (L:D) h. Emergence began in late July in commercial fields near Lethbridge, AB, and 20 d later 81% of the population bad emerged. Emergence was completed by the end of August. Mating was preceded by a complex courtship behavior with the male standing on the dorsum of the mesosoma and gaster of the female, flapping its wings without flight, leaning forward and stroking its antennae over the antennae of the female, leaning back, and repeating the sequence several times. The native weevil Ceutorhynchus neglectus Blatchley was determined to be an alternate host of N. tidius in central and northern Alberta. N. tidius was found in few commercial canola fields in 2003, but in 2004, it occurred over hundreds of thousands of hectares of canola cropland, reaching peak parasitism levels of 45%. In 2005, N. tidius was still common, but parasitism declined relative to that observed in 2004.

Effect of photoperiod on growth, physiologica and Hematological indices of juvenile Siberian sturgeon Acipenser baerii	BIOLOGY BULLETIN												The effect of photoperiod on the growth of juvenile Siberian sturgeon Acipenser baerii has been studied in aquarium experiments. The maximum growth rate of juvenile Siberian sturgeon was observed under 12, 46, and 24 h photoperiods. This was accompanied by high respiratory rate and total food consumption and Z conversion. Rearing in the dark significantly decreased these indices. The hematological indices were within C, Z zn the normal range under optimal photoperiodic conditions. Pronounced neutrophilia and leukopenia were observed in the absence of light.																	1062-3590					NOV-DEC	2007	34	6					583	589		10.1134/S1062359007060088								WOS:000251216000008						
J	Gomi, T				Gomi, Tadashi			Seasonal adaptations of the fall webworm Hyphantria cunea (Drury) (Lepidoptera : Arctiidae) following its invasion of Japan	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH												The fall webworm, Hyphantria cunea (Drury) (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae), invaded Japan from North America about 60 years ago. Immediately after its invasion - and for the first three decades - its life cycle was bivoltine, two generations per year throughout its entire distribution in Japan. Thereafter, its life cycle shifted to trivoltine in the southwestern areas of Japan. In the present study we examined the life-history traits proposed to be implicated in this event with the aim of clarifying the mechanism of this life-cycle shift. The critical photoperiod for diapause induction, as defined by the photoperiod at which 50% of individuals enter diapause, was shorter in the trivoltine populations than in their bivoltine counterparts. The temperature sensitivity of the photoperiodic response, as defined by the difference in the critical photoperiod between 20 and 25 degrees C, was greater in the trivoltine populations than in the bivoltine ones. The geographic variation in larval and pupal periods was positively correlated to the latitude of the original localities of the populations. The change in the number of larval instars would be one of the main factors accounting for the regional differences in the developmental period. These results suggest that some life-history traits of H. cunea have changed following its invasion of Japan as an adaptive response to local climates.																	0912-3814	1440-1703				NOV	2007	22	6					855	861		10.1007/s11284-006-0327-y								WOS:000250834300002						
J	Gomi, T; Nagasaka, M; Fukuda, T; Hagihara, H				Gomi, Tadashi; Nagasaka, Masami; Fukuda, Takeshi; Hagihara, Hideharu			Shifting of the life cycle and life-history traits of the fall webworm in relation to climate change	ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA												The effects of global warming on the life cycle and life-history traits of the fall webworm, Hyphantria cunea (Drury) (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae), were investigated in Fukui, Japan. Our previous studies showed that the Fukui population had a predominantly bivoltine life cycle, but recently the life cycle has changed. In the present study, the life-history traits of individuals collected in 2002 in Fukui were clarified and compared to those in the previous studies. The lower threshold temperature for development and the thermal constant for one generation were 10.6 degrees C and 724.4 degree days, respectively. Although these developmental parameters were not investigated in the previous studies, the difference of the developmental period between the present and previous results was negligible in the larval and pupal stages at 20 degrees C. The critical photoperiod for diapause induction was 14 h 29 min at 20 degrees C and 14 h 10 min at 25 degrees C. The critical photoperiod at 25 degrees C was shortened to 14 min from that of the previous studies for individuals collected in 1995. The incidence of pupal diapause in the second generation was investigated in individuals that were collected as fourth and fifth instars in the field. Some portion of individuals averted diapause even if they were kept under a short photoperiod of L14:D10 at 25 degrees C after collection. These results, together with climate data and field observations in Fukui, suggest that at least a part of the population has three generations per year at present. This shift of the life cycle occurred within 7 years and is probably related to global warming in recent years.																	0013-8703					NOV	2007	125	2					179	184		10.1111/j.1570-7458.2007.00616.x								WOS:000250262100009

Host plant and latitude-related diapause variation in Rhagoletis pomonella: a test for multifaceted life history adaptation on different stages of diapause development	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY												Variation in the overwintering pupal diapause of Rhagoletis pomonella appears to adapt sympatric populations of the fly to seasonal differences in the fruiting times of their host plants, generating ecological reproductive isolation. Here, we investigate what aspects of diapause development are differentially affected (1) by comparing the propensities of apple vs. hawthorn-infesting host races of R. pomonella to forgo an initially deep diapause and directly develop into adults, and (2) by determining the chronological order that R. pomonella races and sibling species break diapause and eclose when reared under standardized environmental conditions. The results imply that factors affecting initial diapause depth (and/or differential mortality during the prewintering period) and those determining the timing of diapause termination or rates of post-diapause development are both under differential selection and are to some degree genetically uncoupled in flies. The modular nature of diapause life history adaptation in Rhagoletis suggests that phenology may involve multiple genetic changes and represent a stronger ecological barrier separating phytophagous specialists than is generally appreciated.																	1010-061X					NOV	2007	20	6					2101	2112		10.1111/j.1420-9101.2007.01435.x								WOS:000250298300003	17956381

Influence of seasonal timing on thermal ecology and thermal reaction norm evolution in Wyeomyia smithii	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY												Evolutionary changes in the seasonal timing of life-history events can alter a population's exposure to seasonally variable environmental factors. We illustrate this principle in Wyeomyia smithii by showing that: (1) geographic divergence in diapause timing reduces differences among populations in the thermal habitat experienced by nondiapause stages; and (2) the thermal habitat of the growing season is more divergent at high compared with low temperatures with respect to daily mean temperatures. Geographic variation in thermal reaction norms for development time was greater in a warm compared with a cool rearing treatment, mirroring the geographic trend in daily mean temperature. Geographic variation in body size was unrelated to geographic temperature variation, but was also unrelated to development time or fecundity. Our results suggest that proper interpretation of geographic trends may often require detailed knowledge of life-history timing.																	1010-061X					NOV	2007	20	6					2144	2153		10.1111/j.1420-9101.2007.01428.x								WOS:000250298300007	17903189

Avian Clock gene polymorphism: evidence for a latitudinal cline in allele frequencies	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												In comparison with most animal behaviours, circadian rhythms have a well-characterized molecular genetic basis. Detailed studies of circadian clock genes in 'model' organisms provide a foundation for interpreting the functional and evolutionary significance of polymorphic circadian clock genes found within free-living animal populations. Here, we describe allelic variation in a region of the avian Clock orthologue which encodes a functionally significant polyglutamine repeat (ClkpolyQcds), within free-living populations of two passerine birds, the migratory bluethroat (Luscinia svecica) and the predominantly nonmigratory blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus). Multiple ClkpolyQcds alleles were found within populations of both species (bluethroat: 12 populations, 7 alleles; blue tit: 14 populations, 9 alleles). Some populations of both species were differentiated at the ClkpolyQcds locus as measured by F-ST and R-ST values. Among the blue tit, but not bluethroat populations, we found evidence of latitudinal clines in (i) mean ClkpolyQcds repeat length, and (ii) the proportions of three ClkpolyQcds genotype groupings. Parallel analyses of microsatellite allele frequencies, which are considered to reflect selectively neutral processes, indicate that interpopulation allele frequency variation at the ClkpolyQcds and microsatellite loci does not reflect the same underlying demographic processes. The possibility that the observed interpopulation ClkpolyQcds allele frequency variation is, at least in part, maintained by selection for microevolutionary adaptation to photoperiodic parameters correlated with latitude warrants further study.

Haplotype analysis of vernalization loci in European barley germplasm reveals novel VRN-H1 alleles and a predominant winter VRN-H1/VRN-H2 multi-locus haplotype	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS												In barley, variation in the requirement for vernalization (an extended period of low temperature before flowering can occur) is determined by the VRN-H1, -H2 and -H3 loci. In European cultivated germplasm, most variation in vernalization requirement is accounted for by alleles at VRN-H1 and VRN-H2 only, but the range of allelic variation is largely unexplored. Here we characterise VRN-H1 and VRN-H2 haplotypes in 429 varieties representing a large portion of the acreage sown to barley in Western Europe over the last 60 years. Analysis of genotype, intron I sequencing data and growth habit tests identified three novel VRN-H1 alleles and determined the most frequent VRN-H1 intron I rearrangements. Combined analysis of VRN-H1 and VRN-H2 alleles resulted in the classification of seventeen VRN-H1/VRN-H2 multi-locus haplotypes, three of which account for 79% of varieties. The molecular markers employed here represent powerful diagnostic tools for prediction of growth habit and assessment of varietal purity. These markers will also allow development of germplasm to test the behaviour of individual alleles with the aim of understanding the relationship between allelic variation and adaptation to specific agri-environments.

Developmental response to a seasonal time constraint: the effects of photoperiod on reproduction in the grasshopper Romalea microptera	ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												1. Some organisms respond adaptively to seasonal time constraints by altering development time to life-history transitions (e.g. metamorphosis, oviposition). Such life-history changes may have costs (e.g. reduced fecundity, mass, offspring quality). 2. The hypothesis that a northern population of the grasshopper Romalea microptera (Beauvois) would show adaptive plasticity in oviposition timing in response to seasonal time constraints was tested by manipulating photoperiod to simulate the middle of the active season (Long photoperiod), the end of the active season (Short photoperiod), and seasonal change (photoperiod Declining from long to short). Females received either high or low food rations. Short or Declining photoperiod were predicted to induce early oviposition with costs of reduced egg number, post-oviposition mass, or egg size, particularly in low-food females. 3. Effects of food ration and photoperiod, but not interaction, were significant in failure time analysis of age at oviposition. MANCOVA on age at oviposition, egg number, and post-oviposition mass yielded similar effects. The multivariate effect of photoperiod resulted primarily from reduced time to oviposition in Short or Declining photoperiod. No costs in egg number or post-oviposition mass were associated with this photoperiod-induced reduction in time to oviposition. The multivariate effect of food ration resulted mainly from lower egg number with low food. Food ration affected egg size, but photoperiod and interaction did not. In all cases, Short and Declining photoperiod produced similar effects. 4. In its northern range, R. microptera accelerates reproduction in response to seasonal constraints, a response that may be adaptive. How R. microptera avoids costs associated with this reduced pre-oviposition period remains unknown.

Adaptations for life in the Arctic: evidence that melatonin rhythms in reindeer are not driven by a circadian oscillator but remain acutely sensitive to environmental photoperiod	JOURNAL OF PINEAL RESEARCH												In reindeer Rangifer tarandus, a high latitude species, the rhythmic production of melatonin periodically dissipates under natural photoperiods when, in mid-winter, there is near permanent darkness and again, in summer, when there is permanent light. In spring and autumn, as expected, melatonin production reflects the ambient light:dark (LD) cycle. We investigated the expression of circadian mechanisms on blood levels of melatonin in reindeer. Two experiments were conducted in which animals were transferred from natural photic conditions into continuous darkness for 3 days: (i) in February, when they had been exposed to an LD cycle (11L:13D) and (ii) in July, when they had been exposed to permanent light. In July, plasma levels of melatonin rose abruptly on exposure to darkness but then declined over 24 hr before displaying a second rise and decline over the following 36 hr. In contrast, in February, levels of melatonin rose abruptly but then remained elevated for more than 60 hr in darkness. Melatonin secretion upon exposure to darkness did not conform to a circadian pattern and did not, therefore, support the hypothesis that pineal activity in reindeer is tightly regulated by circadian mechanisms. Instead the secretion of melatonin appeared to be acutely and directly sensitive to ambient lighting. The results are consistent with a model in which Arctic resident animals have adapted to extreme photic conditions by disconnecting the generation of the pineal melatonin signal from their circadian machinery and relying, instead, on its being driven by the LD cycle for just a few weeks annually in spring and autumn.																	0742-3098					OCT	2007	43	3					289	293		10.1111/j.1600-079X.2007.00476.x								WOS:000249425400011	17803527

An agent-based model of group decision making in baboons	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES					Workshop on Modelling Natural Action Selection	JUL, 2005	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND	UK Biotechnol & Biol Sci Res Council				We present an agent- based model of the key activities of a troop of chacma baboons ( Papio hamadryas ursinus) based on the data collected at De Hoop Nature Reserve in South Africa. We analyse the predictions of the model in terms of how well it is able to duplicate the observed activity patterns of the animals and the relationship between the parameters that control the agent's decision procedure and the model's predictions. At the current stage of model development, we are able to show that across a wide range of decision parameter values, the baboons are able to achieve their energetic and social time requirements. The simulation results also show that decisions concerning movement ( group action selection) have the greatest influence on the outcomes. Those cases where the model's predictions fail to agree with the observed activity patterns have highlighted key elements that were missing from the field data, and that would need to be collected in subsequent fieldwork. Based on our experience, we believe group decision making is a fertile field for future research, and agent- based modelling offers considerable scope for understanding group action selection.

Tethya hibernica has a spherical body with tubercles on the surface. The colour in life is ochreous to yellow and shows in alcohol a white colour with greyish core. The oxyspherasters are evenly and densely scattered throughout the whole cortex. Their diameter is about 31-60 mu m and the R/C value range between 0.40 and 0.78. Micrasters form a discrete layer allocated to the exopinacoderm surface and support the endopinacoderm of the lacunae. Both the main and the auxiliary megascleres are strongyloxeas. Tethya hibernica possesses in contrast to the closely related T. norvegica auxiliary megascleres. In addition to the morphological description we analysed a fragment of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) mtDNA gene for T. hibernica and the other European species T. aurantium, T. citrina and T. norvegica to check for differences in nucleotide and amino acid sequence between the species. We found that T. hibernica is more closely related to the North-West Atlantic species T. norvegica and T. citrina than to T. aurantium or other non-European species. In conclusion, it is possible to differentiate the new species T. hibernica clearly from all other European species both by morphological and molecular methods.

Geographic variation in body size and sexual size dimorphism of a seed-feeding beetle	AMERICAN NATURALIST												Body size of many animals varies with latitude: body size is either larger at higher latitudes (Bergmann's rule) or smaller at higher latitudes ( converse Bergmann's rule). However, the causes underlying these patterns are poorly understood. Also, studies rarely explore how sexual size dimorphism varies with latitude. Here we investigate geographic variation in body size and sexual size dimorphism of the seed-feeding beetle Stator limbatus, collected from 95 locations along a 38 degrees range in latitude. We examine 14 variables to test whether clines in environmental factors are adequate to explain geographic patterns of body size. We found that body size and sexual size dimorphism of S. limbatus varied considerably with latitude; beetles were smaller but more dimorphic at lower latitudes. Body size was not correlated with a gradient in mean temperature, contrary to the commonly accepted hypothesis that clines are produced by latitudinal gradients in temperature. Instead, we found that three factors were adequate to explain the cline in body size: clinal variation in host plant seed size, moisture ( humidity), and seasonality ( variance in humidity, precipitation, and temperature). We also found that the cline in sexual size dimorphism was partially explainable by a gradient in moisture, though moisture alone was not sufficient to explain the cline. Other ecological or environmental variables must necessarily contribute to differences in selection on male versus female body size. The main implications of our study are that the sexes differ in the magnitude of clinal variation in body size, creating latitudinal variation in sexual size dimorphism, and that clines in body size of seed beetles are likely influenced by variation in host seed size, water availability, and seasonality.

Diapause could be induced by thermoperiod under both LL and DD; however, in the range of 24-30 degrees C, lower incidences of diapause were observed under LL than under DD. The critical cryophase was found to be dependent on the mean temperature of the thermoperiod applied. Although the thermoperiodic response pattern was similar under LL and DD, the incidence of diapause was higher under LL when the duration of the cryophase did not exceed 12 h. In contrast, when the duration of the cryophase was longer than 12 h, the incidence of diapause under LL was lower or equal to that under DD. When a thermoperiod of 24 degrees C (cryophase) and 28 degrees C (thermophase) was applied, the incidence of diapause was higher under LL than under DD, regardless of the duration of the cryophase. Thermoperiodic responses under a photoperiod of L12:D12 and under DD further revealed that induction of diapause was strongly influenced by the photophase temperature. Moreover, the incidence of diapause was lower when the thermophase coincided with the photophase than when the cryophase coincided with the photophase.

Forage production of tropical grasses under extended daylength at subtropical and tropical latitudes	ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY												Decreased growth of warm-season forage grasses during subtropical winters has been shown to be a response to short-daylength during those months. The objective of this research was to evaluate the influence of short-daylength on growth of forage grasses in low latitude locations. Three grasses (Argentine bahiagrass, Paspalum notatum Flugge; Common guineagrass, Panicum maximum Jacq.; Tifton-85 bermudagrass, Cynodon spp. Pers.) were grown at three locations (south Florida, Puerto Rico, and St. Croix) under extended (15h) and natural daylength during 2 years. Plots were harvested at 5-week (October-February) and 4-week (March-April) intervals to measure dry matter (DM) yield and nutritive value of the herbage. Daylength effects were found on DM harvested for all grasses in south Florida (P < 0.01). At that location, grasses exposed to increased daylength averaged a 44% increase in DM harvested compared to those grown under natural daylength. Daylength effects were consistent for bahiagrass at the other two locations as well. However, guineagrass and bermudagrass did not respond to extended daylength in Puerto Rico and St. Croix. These results showed that bahiagrass is capable of producing additional forage during the cool season at all locations tested if sensitivity to photoperiod is genetically removed or attenuated.

J	Gotoh, T; Shida, T				Gotoh, Tetsuo; Shida, Teruo			Life cycles and interactions in spider mites (Acari : Tetranychidae) on dwarf bamboo, Sasa senanensis (F. & S.) (Poaceae), in Japan	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ACAROLOGY												To clarify the interactions among mite species coexisting on the same plant, we determined the population dynamics of five spider mites (Acari: Tetranychidae) and their predators (Phytoseiidae, Stigmaeidae) appearing on dwarf bamboo, Sasa senanensis (Franchet and Savatier) (Poaceae), which has a high degree of structural heterogeneity in leaf pubescence. Tetranychid mites, Aponychus corpuzae Rimando, Panonychus bambusicola Ehara and Gotoh and Stigniaeopsis longus (Saito) preferred glabrous leaves, whereas Schizotetranychus recki Ehara and Yezonychus sapporensis Ehara, and the predators Agistemus summersi Ehara (Stigmaeidae) and Phytoseius tenuiformis Ehara (Phytoseiidae) preferred hirsute leaves. Species living on glabrous leaves tended to avoid species living on hirsute leaves. However, three species that prefer glabrous leaves sometimes coexisted with and sometimes avoided species that prefered hirsute leaves. Each species probably has some range of leaf hairiness that they tolerate and prefer. The presence of leaf hairs along the midvein of the lower surfaces of the leaves are especially important because they increase the acceptable range for coexistence of species preferring glabrous or hirsute leaves. Stigniaeopsis longus coexisted with Typhlodromus bainbusae Ehara, which is a species-specific predator of St. longus. Yezonychus sapporensis coexisted with Ag. summersi, which is a predator of Y. sapporensis and Sc. recki. The population density of each spider mite species produced one to three peaks in spring, autumn and/or early winter depending on the species and the census periods. Phytoseius tenuiformis accounted for most of the phytoseiid mites on Sasa leaves and occurred on the most hirsute leaves. Almost all phytoseiid mites collected in the nests of the spider mite St. longus were T bambusae. The critical photoperiods of five spider mite species ranged from 13.5 to 14.5 h at 18 degrees C, which occured between late August and mid-September in Sapporo. The dates by which 50% or more individuals entered diapause were between late August and late September, roughly corresponding with timing predicted by the critical photoperiods. The maximum number of generations that could be produced in a year was estimated as four or five based on the total degree-days accumulated above the lower temperature threshold (10.2-12.1 degrees C) of five spider mite species and the thermal constant (164.5-217.7 DD) of these mite species.																	0164-7954					SEP	2007	33	3					259	273		10.1080/01647950708684531								WOS:000249162400008

The effects of latitude and day length on fattening strategies of wintering coal tits Periparus ater (L.): a field study and aviary experiment	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												1. Cyclic daily fattening routines are very common in wintering small wild birds, and are thought to be the consequence of a trade-off between different environmental and state-dependent factors. According to theory, these trajectories should range from accelerated (i.e. mass increases exponentially towards dusk) when mass-dependent predation costs are the most important cause of mortality risk, to decelerated (i.e. the rate of mass gain is highest at dawn and decreases afterward) when starvation is the greater risk. 2. We examine if geographically separate populations of coal tits, wintering in Scotland and central Spain under contrasting photoperiods, show differences in their strategies of daily mass regulation. We describe population differences in wild birds under natural conditions, and experimentally search for interpopulation variation in diurnal body mass increase under common, manipulated, photoperiod conditions (LD 9 : 15 h vs. 7 : 17 h), controlling for temperature, food availability, predator pressure and foraging arena. 3. Winter diurnal mass gain of wild coal tits was more delayed towards the latter part of the daylight period in central Spain (i.e. the locality with longer winter days) than in Scotland. In both localities, the pattern was linked to the average mass at dawn, with mass increasing more rapidly in lighter birds. However, under the controlled photoperiod situation the pattern of daily mass gain was similar in both populations. Diurnal body mass gain was more accelerated at the end of the day, and the increase in body mass in the first hour of the day was considerably lower under the long (9 h) than under the short (7 h) photoperiod in both populations. 4. Wintering coal tits show patterns of mass gain through the day that are compatible with current theories of the costs and benefits of fat storage, with birds at lower latitudes (with longer winter days) having a greater tendency to delay mass gain until late in the day. The experimental study revealed that these patterns are plastic, with birds responding directly to the photoperiod that they experience, suggesting that they are continually making fine-scale adjustments to energy reserves on the basis of both inherent (e.g. state-dependent) and extrinsic cues.

J	Kingsolver, JG; Nagle, A				Kingsolver, Joel G.; Nagle, Annemarie			Evolutionary divergence in thermal sensitivity and diapause of field and laboratory populations of Manduca sexta	PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL ZOOLOGY												The tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta has been an important model system in insect biology for more than half a century. Here we report the evolutionary divergence in thermal sensitivity and diapause initiation between field and laboratory populations that were separated for more than 35 yr ( 1240 laboratory generations) and that are descendants from the same field populations in central North Carolina. At intermediate rearing temperatures (20 degrees-25 degrees C), mean body size was significantly larger and development time significantly faster in the laboratory than in the field populations. At higher temperatures (30 degrees-35 degrees C), these mean differences between populations were reduced or eliminated, and larval survival at 35 degrees C was significantly lower in the laboratory population than in the field population. F-1 crosses had survival and development time to wandering similar to the field population times at both 25 degrees and 35 degrees C; body mass at wandering for F-1 crosses was intermediate compared with that of the field and laboratory populations. Comparisons with earlier field and laboratory studies suggest evolutionary reductions in thermal tolerance and performance at high temperatures in the laboratory population. The critical photoperiod initiating diapause in field populations in North Carolina did not change detectably between the 1960s and 2005. In contrast, the laboratory population has evolved a reduced tendency to diapause under short- day conditions, relative to the field population.																	1522-2152					SEP-OCT	2007	80	5					473	479		10.1086/519962								WOS:000248351500002	17717810

Influence of fire on black-tailed prairie dog colony expansion in shortgrass steppe	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT												Factors influencing the distribution and abundance of black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) colonies are of interest to rangeland managers because of the significant influence prairie dogs can exert on both livestock and biodiversity. We examined the influence of 4 prescribed burns and one wildfire on the rate and direction of prairie dog colony expansion in shortgrass steppe of southeastern Colorado. Our study was conducted during 2 years with below-average precipitation, when prairie dog colonies were expanding throughout the study area. Under these dry conditions, the rate of black-tailed prairie dog colony expansion into burned grassland ((X) over bar = 2.6 ha . 100-m perimeter(-1) . y(-1); range = 0.8-5.9 ha . 100-m perimeter(-1). y(-1); N = 5 colonies) was marginally greater than the expansion rate into unburned grassland ((X) over bar = 1.3 ha . 100-m perimeter(-1) y(-1); range = 0.2-4.9 ha . 100-m perimeter(-1) . y(-1); N = 23 colonies; P = 0.066). For 3 colonies that were burned on only a portion of their perimeter, we documented consistently high rates of expansion into the adjacent burned grassland (38%-42% of available burned habitat colonized) but variable expansion rates into the adjacent unburned grassland (2%-39% of available unburned habitat colonized). While our results provide evidence that burning can increase colony expansion rate even under conditions of low vegetative structure, this effect was minor at the scale of the overall colony complex because some unburned colonies were also able to expand at high rates. This result highlights the need to evaluate effects of fire on colony expansion during above-average rainfall years, when expansion into unburned grassland may be considerably lower.

A Pseudo-Response Regulator is misexpressed in the photoperiod insensitive Ppd-D1a mutant of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS												Ppd-D1 on chromosome 2D is the major photoperiod response locus in hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum). A semi-dominant mutation widely used in the "green revolution" converts wheat from a long day (LD) to a photoperiod insensitive (day neutral) plant, providing adaptation to a broad range of environments. Comparative mapping shows Ppd-D1 to be colinear with the Ppd-H1 gene of barley (Hordeum vulgare) which is a member of the pseudo-response regulator (PRR) gene family. To investigate the relationship between wheat and barley photoperiod genes we isolated homologues of Ppd-H1 from a Chinese Spring' wheat BAC library and compared them to sequences from other wheat varieties with known Ppd alleles. Varieties with the photoperiod insensitive Ppd-D1a allele which causes early flowering in short (SD) or LDs had a 2 kb deletion upstream of the coding region. This was associated with misexpression of the 2D PRR gene and expression of the key floral regulator FT in SDs, showing that photoperiod insensitivity is due to activation of a known photoperiod pathway irrespective of day length. Five Ppd-D1 alleles were found but only the 2 kb deletion was associated with photoperiod insensitivity. Photoperiod insensitivity can also be conferred by mutation at a homoeologous locus on chromosome 2B (Ppd-B1). No candidate mutation was found in the 2B PRR gene but polymorphism within the 2B PRR gene cosegregated with the Ppd-B1 locus in a doubled haploid population, suggesting that insensitivity on 2B is due to a mutation outside the sequenced region or to a closely linked gene.

From cradle to early grave: juvenile mortality in European shags Phalacrocorax aristotelis results from inadequate development of foraging proficiency	BIOLOGY LETTERS												In most long-lived animal species, juveniles survive less well than adults. A potential mechanism is inferior foraging skills but longitudinal studies that follow the development of juvenile foraging are needed to test this. We used miniaturized activity loggers to record daily foraging times of juvenile and adult European shags Phalacrocorax aristotelis from fledging to the following spring. Juveniles became independent from their parents 40 days post-fledging. They compensated for poor foraging proficiency by foraging for approximately 3 h d(-1) longer than adults until constrained by day length in early November. Thereafter, juvenile foraging time tracked shortening day length up to the winter solstice, when foraging time of the two age classes converged and continued to track day length until early February. Few individuals died until midwinter and mortality peaked in January-February, with juvenile mortality (including some of the study birds) five times that of adults. In their last two weeks of life, juveniles showed a marked decline in foraging time consistent with individuals becoming moribund. Our results provide compelling evidence that juveniles compensate for poor foraging proficiency by increasing foraging time, a strategy that is limited by day length resulting in high winter mortality.

All three diapause-inducing factors had a significant influence on the incidence of diapause. Both populations could be induced to enter diapause under pertinent conditions. Long day length in G0 decreased the incidence of diapause and lowered the critical temperature for diapause-induction in G1. There were significant differences in the incidence of diapause between the two populations in almost all combinations. Compared to the southern Hangzhou population, the northern Changchun population produced a higher proportion of diapause individuals, and had higher critical temperatures for diapause-induction in all 6 photoperiod combinations used in G0 and G1 except for the one in which short day length (8L-16D) was used in both generations.																	0003-6862					AUG	2007	42	3					383	389		10.1303/aez.2007.383								WOS:000249835200006

Biology of Cheirogaleus major in a littoral rain forest in southeast madagascar	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY												Greater dwarf lemurs (Cheirogaleus major) are small nocturnal primates from the rain forests of eastern Madagascar. I investigated a population of Cheirogaleus major in a littoral rain forest of Southeast Madagascar during 2 rainy seasons to supplement the sparse information available for the species. I collected data on morphology, group composition, sleeping behavior, home range, and social organization via mark/recapture, radio telemetry, and focal individual observations. I identified 2 presumed family groups, and my data from radiotracking revealed a monogamous social organization. In each group, I found an adult pair and its presumed offspring sharing home ranges and sleeping sites together. I also observed gregarious behavior of group members during their nocturnal activity. I found no difference in body measurements between sexes, but body mass and tail circumference increased significantly from November to February, indicating a fatting period before hibernating.																	0164-0291					AUG	2007	28	4					895	905		10.1007/s10764-007-9163-3								WOS:000249624500011						
J	Buschini, MLT				Tunes Buschini, Maria Luisa			Life-history and sex allocation in Trypoxylon (syn. Trypargilum) lactitarse (Hymenoptera; Crabronidae)	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGICAL SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH												Hymenopterans have become a model for the study of factors that govern sex allocation. In 1983, Seger proposed a model to study Sphecidae wasps with a strong prediction that sex ratio for univoltine wasps should be I : I (female : male), and for partially bivoltine species it should be male-biased. The present study investigates if Trypoxylon lactitarse (Saussure, 1867) is a univoltine or a bivoltine species and if Seger's model prediction fits the pattern of sex ratio found in this species. The study was carried Out at Parque Municipal das Araucarias, in the municipality of Guarapuava, state of Paran, southern Brazil, from December 2001 to December 2004. Nests of T. lactitarse were obtained using trap-nests drilled longitudinally to a depth to 80 turn with 7.0, 10.0 and 13.0 mm opening diameter. They were placed in a very heterogeneous site filled with araucaria forests, swamps and grasslands. Trypoxylon lactitarse showed two alternative life histories: either they pupated immediately and emerged as adults later in the same season (direct development), or they entered diapause, overwintering and pupating the following spring (delayed development). Its annual sex ratios were not significantly different from 1 : 1, and both sex ratio of overwintering and sex ratio of direct-developing wasps were also not significantly different from 1 : 1, in all years of this study. By examining these results, it was possible to conclude that although T. lactitarse is a multivoltine species, with four generations per year and two alternative life histories, its sex ratio did not support Seger's model.																	0947-5745					AUG	2007	45	3					206	213		10.1111/j.1439-0469.2006.00405.x								WOS:000249010800005

As such, there is an apparent paradox between observed cosmopolitanism in the zooplankton that is associated with long-distance dispersal, and strong phylogeographical structures at a regional scale. Such population dynamics, far from migration-drift equilibrium, have been shown in the rotifer species complex Brachionus plicatilis, a group of over a dozen species inhabiting salt lakes and coastal lagoons worldwide. Here we present the mitochondrial DNA phylogeography of one of these species, Brachionus manjavacas, in the Iberian Peninsula, where it often co-occurs with the morphologically similar species B. plicatilis sensu stricto. We obtained sequences from 233 individuals from diapausing eggs and clonal cultures from 16 lakes in the Iberian Peninsula, and a Tunisian lake. Two strongly supported deep mitochondrial DNA clades were found (A and B). Phylogenetic and nested clade analysis showed that clade A has a strong phylogeographical structure, with a strong similarity of phylogeographical patterns between B. manjavacas clade A and B. plicatilis s.s. These include (i) signatures of allopatric fragmentation between central and southern populations, and (ii) range expansions in the Iberian Peninsula, both likely to have occurred during the Pleistocene. We find evidence for a glacial refugium in the Guadiana basin. Clades A and B co-occurred in several of these lakes because of range expansion and secondary contact between both clades. The co-occurrence between B. plicatilis s.s. and B. manjavacas is not recent, and both species might have experienced similar environmental challenges during the Pleistocene. The strong correlation of genetic and geographical distance found suggests that historical events can lead to such correlation, mirroring the effects of 'isolation by distance' in equilibrium populations.

J	Swenson, JE; Adamic, M; Huber, D; Stokke, S				Swenson, Jon E.; Adamic, Miha; Huber, Djuro; Stokke, Sigbjorn			Brown bear body mass and growth in northern and southern Europe	OECOLOGIA												We tested six hypotheses to explain expected geographical differences in body masses of 1,771 brown bears (Ursus arctos) from northern and southern Europe (Sweden and Norway compared with Slovenia and Croatia): Bergmann's rule, the fasting endurance hypothesis, and the dietary meat hypothesis, which predicted larger bears in the north; and hypotheses stressing the role of high primary productivity, high population density, low seasonality, and length of the growing season, which predicted larger bears in the south. Although brown bear populations in North America vary greatly in body mass, we found no significant difference in body mass between the two European populations using a new analytical approach incorporating modeled age-standardized body masses in linear models, when correcting for sex and season. The greater variation in North America may be due primarily to the presence of large bears that feed on salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), which does not occur in Europe. Asymptotic body masses were 115 +/- 9 (SE) kg in spring and 141 +/- 9 kg in autumn for southern females, 248 +/- 25 and 243 +/- 24 kg for southern males, 96 +/- 2 and 158 +/- 4 kg for northern females, and 201 +/- 4 and 273 +/- 6 kg for northern males, respectively. Northern bears gained more body mass before hibernation and lost more during hibernation than southern bears, probably because hibernation was twice as long in the north. Northern bears gained and southern bears lost mass during the spring, perhaps due to the greater availability and use of protein-rich food in spring in the north. As reproductive success in bears is correlated with adult female body mass in interpopulation comparisons, brown bears may have relatively similar reproductive rates throughout Europe, although minimum age at primiparity and litter interval are lower in the south.

Early offspring are often more valuable than later ones when food availability and predation risk fluctuate seasonally. Marine zooplankton have evolved a diversity of life history strategies in response to seasonality. We present a state-dependent life history model for the annual and herbivorous high-latitude copepod Calanoides acutus. Individuals are characterised by four states; developmental stage, structural size, energy reserves and vertical location. There are two habitats, a surface habitat with seasonal predation risk and food availability, and a safer deep habitat with no food and low metabolism (diapause). Optimal life histories (diapause and energy allocation strategies) are found by dynamic programming. Seasonal egg fitness (reproductive value) emerges from the model and peak values are typically before the feeding season. Disentangling the fitness components, we conclude that seasonality in egg fitness is caused both by environmental seasonality in food and predation risk and by time-constraints on development and diapause preparation. Realised egg production, as predicted from population simulations, does not match the seasonal peak in offspring fitness but is delayed relative to peak egg fitness. We term this an 'internal life history mismatch' as constraints and tradeoffs cause sub-optimal bird dates for most eggs whereas mothers maximise their reproductive value by high number of eggs rather than few and optimally timed eggs. The earliest eggs have a disproportionately high contribution to population recruitment, emphasising the importance of early eggs and the need to understand seasonal patterns in offspring fitness.

Demographic differences between two sympatric lilies (Calochortus) with contrasting distributions, as revealed by matrix analysis	PLANT ECOLOGY												Related species of similar morphology can differ greatly in distribution and abundance. Elucidating reasons for such differences can contribute to an understanding of intrinsic limiting factors and the causes of rarity. We studied sympatric populations of two terrestrial lilies with contrasting distributions: Calochortus lyallii, which is geographically restricted but locally abundant, and C. macrocarpus, which is widespread but locally sparse. Marked plants of each species were monitored for 5 years in British Columbia, Canada. Matrix projection models were used to estimate annual and stochastic population growth rates (lambda and lambda(s)) and to compare demographic traits. Annual lambda-values ranged from 0.89 to 1.04 in C. lyallii and from 0.89 to 1.01 in C. macrocarpus. Stochastic projections yielded a long-term growth rate near 1 for C. lyallii, but indicated a decline for C. macrocarpus. Elasticity analysis indicated that over the 5-year period of the study, survival of flowering plants made a larger proportional contribution to lambda in C. lyallii than in C. macrocarpus. LTRE analysis showed that temporal variation in lambda was driven primarily by the dynamics of flowering individuals in C. lyallii, and by the dynamics of vegetative individuals in C. macrocarpus. Similarly, higher flowering rates in C. lyallii and greater vegetative stasis in C. macrocarpus made the largest contribution to the difference in lambda between species. Thus, local persistence in these two morphologically similar species appears to be achieved via different demographic pathways. Our analyses show that extrapolations about demographic processes and population dynamics based on taxonomic relatedness, morphological similarity or habitat overlap may often not be justified.

Global dissemination of a single mutation conferring white pericarp in rice	PLOS GENETICS												Here we report that the change from the red seeds of wild rice to the white seeds of cultivated rice ( Oryza sativa) resulted from the strong selective sweep of a single mutation, a frame-shift deletion within the Rc gene that is found in 97.9% of white rice varieties today. A second mutation, also within Rc, is present in less than 3% of white accessions surveyed. Haplotype analysis revealed that the predominant mutation originated in the japonica subspecies and crossed both geographic and sterility barriers to move into the indica subspecies. A little less than one Mb of japonica DNA hitchhiked with the rc allele into most indica varieties, suggesting that other linked domestication alleles may have been transferred from japonica to indica along with white pericarp color. Our finding provides evidence of active cultural exchange among ancient farmers over the course of rice domestication coupled with very strong, positive selection for a single white allele in both subspecies of O. sativa.

J	Winterhalter, WE; Mousseau, TA				Winterhalter, Wade E.; Mousseau, Timothy A.			Patterns of phenotypic and genetic variation for the plasticity of diapause incidence	EVOLUTION												Phenotypic plasticity describes an organism's ability to produce multiple phenotypes in direct response to its environmental conditions. Over the past 15 years empiricists have found that this plasticity frequently exhibits geographic variation and often possesses a significant heritable genetic basis. However, few studies have examined both of these aspects of plasticity simultaneously. Here, we examined both the geographic and genetic variations of the plasticity for diapause incidence (the proportion of eggs that enter an arrested state of development capable of surviving over the winter) relative to temperatures and photoperiods associated with long and short season environments across six populations of the striped ground cricket, Allonemobius socius, using a half-sibling split brood quantitative genetic design. We found that plasticity, as measured by the slope of the reaction norm, was greater in the southern-low altitude region (where populations are bivoltine) relative to the southern-high and northern-low altitude regions (where populations are univoltine). However, the heritability of plasticity was only significantly different from zero in univoltine populations that experienced "intermediate" natal season lengths. These patterns suggest that selection may favor the plasticity of diapause incidence in bivoltine regions, but act against plasticity in regions in which populations are univoltine. Furthermore, our data suggest that under "intermediate" natal season length conditions, the interplay between local adaptation and gene flow may keep the plasticity of diapause incidence low (but still significant) while maintaining its genetic variation. As such, this study not only provides a novel observation into the geographic variation of phenotypic plasticity, but also provides much needed groundwork for tests of its adaptive significance.

Seals rarely hauled out at any of the sites during winter, although all cohorts (adult males, females, and juveniles) were observed underwater and surfacing at breathing holes throughout winter (June-September) and spring (October-December). Seal vocalizations were recorded during each sampling session throughout the study (n = 102 daytime at seven sites collectively, and n = 5 24-h samples at each of two sites). Mean daytime calling rate was low in mid-winter (July) (mean = 18.9 +/- 7.1 calls/min) but increased monthly, reaching a peak during the breeding season (November) (mean = 62.6 +/- 15.7 calls/min). Mean nighttime calling rate was high throughout the winter and early spring (July-October) with mean nocturnal calling rate in July (mean = 61.8 +/- 35.1 calls/min) nearly equal to mean daytime calling rate in November (during 24-h daylight). Reduced vocal behavior during winter daylight periods may result from animals utilizing the limited daylight hours for nonvocal activities, possibly feeding.

The genetic structure of hawthorn-infesting Rhagoletis pomonella populations in Mexico: implications for sympatric host race formation	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												The genetic origins of species may not all trace to the same time and place as the proximate cause(s) for population divergence. Moreover, inherent gene-flow barriers separating populations may not all have evolved under the same geographical circumstances. These considerations have lead to a greater appreciation of the plurality of speciation: that one geographical mode for divergence may not always be sufficient to describe a speciation event. The apple maggot fly, Rhagoletis pomonella, a model system for sympatric speciation via host-plant shifting, has been a surprising contributor to the concept of speciation mode plurality. Previous studies have suggested that past introgression of inversion polymorphism from a hawthorn-fly population in the trans-Mexican volcanic belt (EVTM) introduced diapause life-history variation into a more northern fly population that subsequently contributed to sympatric host race formation and speciation in the United States (US). Here, we report results from a microsatellite survey implying (i) that volcanic activity in the eastern EVTM may have been responsible for the initial geographical isolation of the Mexican and northern hawthorn-fly populations c. 1.57 mya; and (ii) that flies in the Sierra Madre Oriental Mountains (SMO) likely served as a conduit for past gene flow from the EVTM into the US. Indeed, the microsatellite data suggest that the current US population may represent a range expansion from the northern SMO. We discuss the implications of these findings for sympatric race formation in Rhagoletis and speciation theory.

Polymorphic Indian ricegrass populations result from overlapping waves of migration	WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST												Indian ricegrass (Achnatherum hymenoides [Roem. & Schult.] Barkworth) is a rangeland species native to western North America with populations that may exhibit distinct seed-size morphs borne on separate plants. These morphs are often associated with very different levels of seed dormancy. We compared RAN) profiles of the relatively infrequent and highly dormant jumbo seed morph to its more germinable small or large (non-jumbo) companion seed morphs collected front 9 sites where they were sympatric. Jumbo seed accessions from 9 additional sites that did not exhibit seed polymorphism were included to better sample this seed morph across the species range. Sympatric seed morphs were consistently distinguishable by their RAPD profiles, and sympatric seed morphs were no more likely to cluster together than nonsympatric seed morphs. The ability of sympatric seed morplis to maintain their genetic identity is compatible with the hypothesis of a predominately autogamous breeding system. Furthermore, these; data support the hypothesis that local polymorphic populations result from overlapping waves of migration with distinct geographical origins. The jumbo seed morphs exhibited moderate correlation between genetic distance and geographic distance, but the non-jumbo seed morplis exhibited no such correlation. Jumbo seed morphs that were collected at or cast of the Continental Divide in New Mexico and Colorado are more genetically homogeneous than those west of the Continental Divide, and non-jumbo seed morphs from the east are more genetically variable than jumbo seed morphs from the same location,. This suggests that gene flow eastward across the Rocky Mountains has been more. frequent for the noel-jumbo seed morphs than for the jumbo seed morphs.

A molecular basis for natural selection at the timeless locus in Drosophila melanogaster	SCIENCE												Diapause is a protective response to unfavorable environments that results in a suspension of insect development and is most often associated with the onset of winter. The ls-tim mutation in the Drosophila melanogaster clock gene timeless has spread in Europe over the past 10,000 years, possibly because it enhances diapause. We show that the mutant allele attenuates the photosensitivity of the circadian clock and causes decreased dimerization of the mutant TIMELESS protein isoform to CRYPTOCHROME, the circadian photoreceptor. This interaction results in a more stable TIMELESS product. These findings reveal a molecular link between diapause and circadian photoreception.

ABAM, a model for bioaccumulation of POPs in birds: Validation for adult herring gulls and their eggs in Lake Ontario	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												An Avian BioAccumulation Model (ABAM) of persistent organic pollutant (POP) uptake and elimination in adult life-stage of birds was validated by simulation of concentrations of DDE, dieldrin, mirex, and HCB in herring gull eggs in Lake Ontario for the years 1985, 1990, and 1992. These chemicals represented a range of whole-body half-lives of 82-265 days in the gull. Dietary intake of POPs by a female gull was simulated by a dynamic bioenergetics model which included dependence on temperature, photoperiod, egg production, and feeding chicks. Concentrations in the two main prey fish of the gull in Lake Ontario were used for POP exposure. Clearance from the female was based on a two compartment toxicokinetic model. Egg concentrations were estimated from egg/whole body female concentration ratios. Simulated concentrations were compared to measured concentrations in gull eggs from 4 different colonies in the northern part of Lake Ontario. Simulations using a diet of 81% fish and 19% uncontaminated food resulted in the best fit with least variance among predicted and measured data. The mean ratio of predicted to measured concentrations in eggs was 1.0 +/- 0.27 among chemicals, years, and colonies for this exposure scenario. This result was in excellent agreement with field assessments of herring gull diet composition in Lake Ontario of 80-82% fish. The ability to perform accurate a priori simulations for the range of test conditions employed in the validation constituted a rigorous test of the soundness of the model's structure and parameterization. With species-specific adjustments, ABAM can be regarded as a general model for lipophilic POPs bioaccumulation in birds.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				JUN 15	2007	41	12					4339	4347		10.1021/es062205z								WOS:000247187600022	17626434

Effect of temperature on development and survival of the parasitoid Pnigalio pectinicornis (Hymenoptera : Eulophidae) reared on Phyllocnistis citrella (Lepidoptera : Gracillariidae)	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												Laboratory studies were conducted to assess the effect of temperature on the development and survival of the indigenous parasitoid Pnigalio pectinicornis L. on the citrus leaf miner Phyllocnistis citrella Stainton as host, fed on leaves of Citrus sinensis L. Osbek cultivar Washington navel and Citrus reticulata Blanco cultivar Clementine. Experiments were conducted at five constant temperatures ranging from 15 to 32.5 degrees C, with 60 +/- 10% RH and a photoperiod of 14:10 (L:D) h. The relationship between the developmental rate and temperature was determined using both linear and nonlinear (Lactin's formula) models. Developmental time of immature stages tended to be shorter as the temperature increased the range from 15 to 30 degrees C. Mortality was greater at the temperatures extreme tested. Both linear and nonlinear models provided a reliable fit of developmental rates versus temperature for all immature stages. Developmental thresholds that were estimated by the linear model for eggs were higher than those estimated by the nonlinear model. However, higher values of the low developmental threshold for larva and pupa stage of P. pectinicornis were estimated by the Lactin-2 model than that by the linear model. The potential of these models to predict the phenology of this parasitoid and its biological characteristics found in this study are discussed for its proper use as a biological control agent.																	0046-225X					JUN	2007	36	3					497	505		10.1603/0046-225X(2007)36[497:EOTODA]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000246917100001	17540056

Sexual reproduction and diapause of Hexarthra sp (Rotifera) in short-lived ponds in the Chihuahuan Desert	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. In the life cycle of monogonont rotifers it is generally assumed that diapausing eggs invariably hatch into amictic stem females which produce female offspring parthenogenetically. Diapausing eggs are only produced by later generations after sexual reproduction has been induced by environmental cues. 2. We show that populations of an undescribed Hexarthra species inhabiting small temporary ponds in the Chihuahuan Desert deviate from this life cycle pattern. These ponds may dry within days and up to 85% of females were mictic. Females producing male offspring and diapausing eggs were observed 1 or 2 days, respectively, after ponds had filled with water. 3. Under laboratory conditions, 7-46% of females hatching from re-hydrated sediments were sexual. Male offspring of these females can fertilise other mictic stem females leading to diapausing egg formation. In laboratory experiments, females produced fully developed diapausing eggs within 1.9 days at 20 degrees C and 1.2 days at 30 degrees C. 4. In addition, embryonic development time (1.1-0.3 days at temperatures between 12 and 30 degrees C) and juvenile period (2.1-0.5 days for the same temperature range) are shorter than those of other rotifer species. In short-lived habitats, the potential for rapid population development and production of new diapausing eggs may be crucial in the long-term survival of populations.																	0046-5070	1365-2427				JUN	2007	52	6					1033	1042		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01751.x								WOS:000246904500006

Minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of 3.1-18.4 and 4.9-9.8 mu g/mL were obtained for NLCQ-I and NLCQ-2, respectively. In the same test setting; the corresponding MBC range for PA-824 was 6.4-12.8 mu g/mL. For rifampicin, isoniazid, minocycline, streptomycin, clarithromycin and capreomycin, the corresponding MBC values were 2.5, > 100, > 156.25, > 12.5, > 312.5 and 37.5 mu g/mL, respectively. Toxicity against Vero cells provided 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of 146.7, > 640 and > 640 mu g/mL for NLCQ-1, NLCQ-2 and PA-824, respectively. Therefore, the selectivity index (SI) was 8-47.3, > 65.3-130.6 and > 50-100 for NLCQ-1, NLCQ-2 and PA-824, respectively.

In the laboratory, insects were exposed to three constant temperatures 15, 20, and 25 degrees C and a photoperiod of 14: 10 (L:D). In the field, temperature and photoperiod were not manipulated; during the study period water temperature ranged between 15.5 and 24.2 degrees C, and photoperiod changed from 13:11 to 14:10 (L:D). Survival to the imaginal stage at 15 degrees C (85.4%) and in the field (88.8%) was higher than that at 20 degrees C (45.8%) and 25 degrees C (8.3%). Based on femur and wing length measurements, the mosquitoes reared under field conditions mean water temperature = 20.5 degrees C were smaller than those laboratory-reared, even when the time of development in the field (29.5 - 36 days) was longer than that observed at 15 degrees C (24 days), 20 degrees C (15 days), and 25 degrees C (11 days). Male emergence was earlier than that of females (protandry) only in the field. Although laboratory conditions included a photoperiod and temperature range comparable with the observed values in the field, the disagreements between field and laboratory results suggest that the characteristics examined in this work could be affected by the joint variation of several factors not controlled in field conditions, such as photoperiod, temperature regime, and/or food quality of larval habitat.																	1081-1710					JUN	2007	32	1					106	111		10.3376/1081-1710(2007)32[106:EODTCO]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000247711500014	17639632

A reliable bioassay procedure to evaluate per os toxicity of Bacillus thuringiensis strains against the rice delphacid, Tagosodes orizicolus (Homoptera : Delphacidae)	REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL												A reliable bioassay procedure was developed to test ingested Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxins on the rice delphacid T(Tagosodes orizicolus. Initially, several colonies were established under greenhouse conditions, using rice plants to nurture the insect. For the bioassay, an in Vitro feeding system was developed for third to fourth instar nymphs, Insects were fed through Parafilm membranes on sugar (10 % sucrose) and honey bee (1:48 vol/vol) solutions, observing a natural mortality of 10-15 % and 0-5 %, respectively. Results were reproducible under controlled conditions during the assay (18 +/- 0.1 degrees C at night and 28 +/- 0.1 degrees C during the day, 80 % RH and a 12:12 day:light photoperiod). In addition, natural mortality was quantified on insect colonies, collected from three different geographic areas of Costa Rica, with no significant differences between colonies under controlled conditions. Finally, bioassays were performed to evaluate the toxicity of a Bt collection on T orizicolus. A preliminary sample of twenty-seven Bl strains was evaluated on coarse bioassays using three loops of sporulated colonies in 9 ml of liquid diet, the strains that exhibited higher percentages of T orizicolus mortality were further analyzed in bioassays using lyophilized spores and crystals (1 mg/ml). As a result, strains 26-O-to, 40-X-m, 43-S-d and 23-O-to isolated from homopteran insects showed mortalities of 74, 96, 44 and 82 % respectively while HD-137, HD-1 and Bti showed 19, 83 and 95 % mortalities. Controls showed mortalities between 0 and 10 % in all bioassays. This is the first report of a reliable bioassay procedure to evaluate per os toxicity for a homopteran Species using Bacillus thuringiensis strains.																	0034-7744					JUN	2007	55	2					373	383										WOS:000250013300003	19069752

Vegetative and reproductive phenology of African rue (Peganum harmala) in the northern Chihuahuan Desert	SOUTHWESTERN NATURALIST												African rue (Peganum harmala) is an herbaceous perennial plain native to arid and semiarid regions of northern Africa and Asian deserts that has spread to parts of the Southwestern United States arid northern Mexico. Despite its occurrence in many geographic regions, little is known about the biology and ecology of this invasive species. We conducted field studies on 2 populations of African rue in the northern Chihuahuan Desert to describe its vegetative and reproductive phenology. Overwintering. dormant plants in both populations commenced growth in mid March, grew through May and June, and initially senesced during June and July. Shoot development was synchronous between the 2 populations, but was not related to ambient or soil temperatures or precipitation. Onset of senescence was not related to calendar date or accumulated temperature. Flower production commenced at both sites in mid April, and fruit maturation Occurred in June and July. Fruit maturation was related to calendar date and ambient temperature. In one population, senescent plants initiated new shoots in August and produced a second cohort of flowers. This renewed growth was not related to temperature, but likely triggered by midsummer precipitation. Therefore, African rue exhibits characteristic ''drought evader" growth and reproduction strategies. This fundamental description of African rue phenology, provides knowledge needed to manage this invasive species.																	0038-4909	1943-6262				JUN	2007	52	2					209	218		10.1894/0038-4909(2007)52[209:VARPOA]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000247606900003

The combing of cribellar silk by the prithine Misionella mendensis, with notes on other filistatid spiders (Araneae : Filistatidae)	AMERICAN MUSEUM NOVITATES												We present the first observations of the combing and attaching behavior in the subfamily Prithinae (Filistatidae), taken from Misionella mendensis. We compare its web architecture with that of other prithines (Pritha nana and Pikelinia sp. from Chile) and filistatines (Kukulcania hibernalis and Filistata insidiatrix). The combing behavior of M. mendensis corresponds to the stereotyped type I combing behavior, as is known for other filistatids. However, M. mendensis attaches the cribellar segments in a unique way, splitting the cribellar segment longitudinally and pushing each half to the substrate, attaching the silk with the tarsi of both legs IV simultaneously. These stereotyped movements result in web units of a very characteristic structure. We report the same split attachment behavior in the prithine Pikelinia tambilloi. We scored these observations into a previous dataset for filistatid relationships. Because of the missing observations on attachment behavior in the North American basal genus Filistatinella, the sister group of all other prithines, the evolution of split cribellar strands is a potential synapomorphic characteristic for the Prithinae, or at least the subgroup excluding its basal taxon.																	0003-0082	1937-352X				MAY 16	2007		3563					1	14		10.1206/0003-0082(2007)529[1:TCOCSB]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000246683700001

The lower developmental threshold was 7.4 and 7.2 degrees C, and the thermal constant was 297.4 and 307.5 degree-days for males and females, respectively. The effects of combinations of different temperatures and photoperiods on larval diapause induction and termination were also examined. Larval development showed a short-day type response affected by temperature. The percentage of individuals entering diapause increased with the temperature and photoperiod. The critical photoperiod for diapause induction was between 12 and 14 h at 25 degrees C, whereas at 15 h and 20 degrees C the diapause rate did not reach 50% within the photoperiod range tested. Regardless of the photoperiod, diapause terminated at 15 degrees C but was maintained at 25 degrees C. At 20 degrees C, 90% of individuals terminated diapause at 12 h photoperiod but only 16% at 16 h photoperiod. A significant effect of the photoperiod on the post-diapause emergence pattern of wasps was observed at 15 degrees C. From these results, it is considered that summer diapause enables C. pubicornis to synchronize its occurrence with that of the garden pea leafminer, Chromatomyia horticola.																	0003-6862					MAY	2007	42	2					189	197		10.1303/aez.2007.189								WOS:000247866300004

The present range of N. viridula in Kyushu coincided well with the areas where the mean temperature of the coldest month exceeds 5 degrees C that has been suggested to be the lowest thermal limit for N. viridula to overwinter successfully. The future range of N. viridula is predicted to cover a large area of Kyushu if the temperature rises by 1.4 to 5.8 degrees C by 2100. In some places, N. antennata seemed to have been replaced by N. viridula as a result of their interspecific mating that prevented N. antennata from intraspecific mating. This is because N. antennata was overwhelmed, in abundance, by N. viridula, which has a higher reproductive potential than N. antennata under warm conditions with a sufficient amount of food resources. Conversely, N. antennata populations recovered in a few places where N. viridula had replaced N. antennata in the 1950s, probably due to the shortage of rice plants on which N. viridula preferably reproduces.

Non-photoperiodic factors and timing of breeding in blue tits: Impact of environmental and social influences in semi-natural conditions	BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES												The seasonal development of life-history traits is influenced by many environmental factors. The impact of photoperiodic and non-photoperiodic factors on nest building and egg laying has been rarely investigated in non-domesticated avian species for which long term field data sets are available. Former investigations showed that blue tits originating from geographically close populations in the Mediterranean region do not respond in the same way to photoperiodic factors in semi-natural outdoor conditions. Here we show experimentally that nest building and onset of egg laying in captive blue tits is also proximately influenced by non-photoperiodic factors, including aspects related to aviary characteristics and social interactions between birds of the two sexes originating from different local Mediterranean study populations. In two successive experiments, we show that (1) increasing the volume of the aviary advanced the egg laying period of one specific population by almost I month, and (2) crossing pairs of birds from different origins strongly reduced the nest building and egg laying behaviours. These results indicate that obtaining biologically relevant breeding results in captivity with wild birds requires the control and experimental manipulation of a wide array of complex environmental cues.

Hawthorn-infesting populations of Rhagoletis pomonella in Mexico and speciation mode plurality	EVOLUTION												Categorizing speciation into dichotomous allopatric versus nonallopatric modes may not always adequately describe the geographic context of divergence for taxa. If some of the genetic changes generating inherent barriers to gene flow between populations evolved in geographic isolation, whereas others arose in sympatry, then the mode of divergence would be mixed. The apple maggot fly, Rhagoletis pomonella, has contributed to this emerging concept of a mixed speciation mode "plurality." Genetic studies have implied that a source of diapause life-history variation associated with inversions and contributing to sympatric host race formation and speciation for R. pomonella in the United States may have introgressed from the Eje Volcanico Trans Mexicano (EVTM; a.k.a. the Altiplano) in the past. A critical unresolved issue concerning the introgression hypothesis is how past gene flow occurred given the current 1200-km disjunction in the ranges of hawthorn-infesting flies in the EVTM region of Mexico and the southern extreme of the U.S. population in Texas. Here, we report the discovery of a hawthorn-infesting population of R. pomonella in the Sierra Madre Oriental Mountains (SMO) of Mexico. Sequence data from 15 nuclear loci and mitochondrial DNA imply that the SMO flies are related to, but still different from, U.S. and EVTM flies. The host affiliations, diapause characteristics, and phylogeography of the SMO population are consistent with it having served as a conduit for gene flow between Mexico and the United States. We also present evidence suggesting greater permeability of collinear versus rearranged regions of the genome to introgression, in accord with recent models of chromosomal speciation. We discuss the implications of the results in the context of speciation mode plurality. We do not argue for abandoning the terms sympatry or allopatry, but caution that categorizing divergence into either/or geographic modes may not describe the genetic origins of all species. For R. pomonella in the United States, the proximate selection pressures triggering race formation and speciation stem from sympatric host shifts. However, some of the phenological variation contributing to host-related ecological adaptation and reproductive isolation in sympatry at the present time appears to have an older history, having originated and become packaged into inversion polymorphism in allopatry.

Quantitative trait loci associated with photoperiodic response and stage of diapause in the pitcher-plant mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii	GENETICS												A, vide variety of temperate animals rely on length of day (photoperiodism) to anticipate and prepare for changing seasons by regulating the timing of development, reproduction, dormancy, and migration. Although the molecular basis of circadian rhythms regulating daily activities is well defined, the molecular basis for the photoperiodic regulation of seasonal activities is largely unknown. We use geographic variation in the photoperiodic control of diapause in the pitcher-plant mosquito Wyeomyia smithii to create the first QTL map of photoperiodism in any animal. For critical photoperiod (CPP), we detect QTL that are unique, a QTL that is sex linked, QTL that overlap with QTL for stage of diapause (SOD), and a QTL that interacts epistatically with the circadian rhythm gene, timeless. Results presented here confirm earlier studies concluding that CPP is under directional selection over the climatic gradient of North America and that the evolution of CPP is genetically correlated with SOD. Despite epistasis between timeless and a QTL for CPP, timeless is not located within any detectable QTL, indicating that it plays an ancillary role in the evolution of photopcriodism in W smithii. Finally, we highlight one region of the genome that includes loci contributing to CPP, SOD, and hormonal regulation of development.																	0016-6731					MAY	2007	176	1					391	402		10.1534/genetics.106.068726								WOS:000246960900032	17339202

Historical changes in the phenology of British Odonata are related to climate	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Responses of biota to climate change take a number of forms including distributional shifts, behavioural changes and life history changes. This study examined an extensive set of biological records to investigate changes in the timing of life history transitions (specifically emergence) in British Odonata between 1960 and 2004. The results show that there has been a significant, consistent advance in phenology in the taxon as a whole over the period of warming that is mediated by life history traits. British odonates significantly advanced the leading edge (first quartile date) of the flight period by a mean of 1.51 +/- 0.060 (SEM, n=17) days per decade or 3.08 +/- 1.16 (SEM, n=17) days per degree rise in temperature when phylogeny is controlled for. This study represents the first review of changes in odonate phenology in relation to climate change. The results suggest that the damped temperature oscillations experienced by aquatic organisms compared with terrestrial organisms are sufficient to evoke phenological responses similar to those of purely terrestrial taxa.

Role of larval host plants in the climate-driven range expansion of the butterfly Polygonia c-album	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												1. Some species have expanded their ranges during recent climate warming and the availability of breeding habitat and species' dispersal ability are two important factors determining expansions. The exploitation of a wide range of larval host plants should increase an herbivorous insect species' ability to track climate by increasing habitat availability. Therefore we investigated whether the performance of a species on different host plants changed towards its range boundary, and under warmer temperatures. 2. We studied the polyphagous butterfly Polygonia c-album, which is currently expanding its range in Britain and apparently has altered its host plant preference from Humulus lupulus to include other hosts (particularly Ulmus glabra and Urtica dioica). We investigated insect performance (development time, larval growth rate, adult size, survival) and adult flight morphology on these host plants under four rearing temperatures (18-28.5 degrees C) in populations from core and range margin sites. 3. In general, differences between core and margin populations were small compared with effects of rearing temperature and host plant. In terms of insect performance, host plants were generally ranked U. glabra U. dioica > H. lupulus at all temperatures. Adult P. c-album can either enter diapause or develop directly and higher temperatures resulted in more directly developing adults, but lower survival rates (particularly on the original host H. lupulus) and smaller adult size. 4. Adult flight morphology of wild-caught individuals from range margin populations appeared to be related to increased dispersal potential relative to core populations. However, there was no difference in laboratory reared individuals, and conflicting results were obtained for different measures of flight morphology in relation to larval host plant and temperature effects, making conclusions about dispersal potential difficult. 5. Current range expansion of P. c-album is associated with the exploitation of more widespread host plants on which performance is improved. This study demonstrates how polyphagy may enhance the ability of species to track climate change. Our findings suggest that observed differences in climate-driven range shifts of generalist vs. specialist species may increase in the future and are likely to lead to greatly altered community composition.

Late dormant rapeseed oil treatment against black cherry aphid and cherry fruit moth in sweet cherries	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY												Black cherry aphid [Myzus cerasi (Fabricius)] and cherry fruit moth [Argyresthia pruniella (Clerck)] are the main insect pests on sweet cherries in Norway. In this study, application of rapeseed oil alone and rapeseed oil mixed with pesticides were tested as a control method against overwintering eggs of both black cherry aphid and cherry fruit moth. Results showed that rapeseed oil applied at the late dormant stage significantly reduced damage by black cherry aphid. Efficiency of oil mixed with pesticides was higher, but only significant in three of seven trials. The efficiency of rapeseed oil against cherry fruit moth was low compared with what was achieved for black cherry aphid, but within the range that has been reported for other botanical pesticides. As for the black cherry aphid, adding pesticides to oil decreased damage by the cherry fruit moth. Timing of treatment and effect of temperature were discussed.																	0931-2048					MAY	2007	131	4					284	288		10.1111/j.1439-0418.2007.01155.x								WOS:000245609100008

The objectives of this work were to explore the genome-wide effect of induced mutation in photoperiod-converted induced cotton mutants, estimating the genetic change between mutant and wild-type cottons using simple sequence repeats (SSRs) as well as understand the pattern of SSR mutation in induced muragenesis. Three groups of photoperiod-converted radiomutants ((32)P) including their wild-type parental fines, A- and D-genome diploids, and typically grown cotton cultivars were screened with 250 cotton SSR primer pairs. Forty SSRs revealed the same SSR mutation profile in, at least, 2 independent mutant tines that were different from the original wild types. Induced muragenesis both increased and decreased the allele sizes of SSRs in mutants with the higher mutation rate in SSRs containing dinucleotide motifs. Genetic distance obtained based on 141 informative SSR alleles ranged from 0.09 to 0.60 in all studied cotton genotypes. Genetic distance within all photoperiod-converted induced mutants was in a 0.09-0.25 range. The genetic distance among photoperiod-converted mutants and their originals ranged from 0.28 to 0.50, revealing significant modification of mutants from their original wild types. Typical Gosgpium hirsutum cultivar, Namangan-77, revealed mutational pattern similar to induced radiomutants in 40 mutated SSR loci, implying possible pressure to these SSR loci not only in radiomutagenesis but also during common breeding process. Outcomes of the research should be useful in understanding the photoperiod-related mutations, and markers might help in mapping photoperiodic flowering genes in cotton.

J	Farnsworth, EJ				Farnsworth, Elizabeth J.			Plant life history traits of rare versus frequent plant taxa of sandplains: Implications for research and management trials	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												I apply a comparative, functional group approach to coastal sandplain grassland taxa in order to examine whether rare plant species share certain aspects of rarity and life history characters that are distinct from their more common, co-occurring congeners in these habitats. I compiled a comparative data set containing 16 variables describing biogeographic distributions, level of imperilment, habitat specialization, vegetative versus sexual reproduction, seed dispersal, and dormancy of 27 closely-related pairs of plant species that contrast in their abundance (infrequent versus common) in coastal sandplain grasslands. Frequent and infrequent species were paired within genera (or closely related genera) and thus distributed equivalently across families to control for phylogenetic bias. Paired comparisons revealed that infrequent species were intrinsically rarer range-wide, and exhibited a narrower range and more habitat specialization than their common relatives. A classification tree distinguished infrequent species from common species on the basis of higher habitat specialization, larger seed size, smaller plant height, less reliance less on vegetative (colonial) reproduction, and tendency toward annual or biennial life history. Research and management steps to reduce competition from larger-satured, colonial, perennial species are recommended for these infrequent species. Basic research involving more species and more data on ecophysiological characters, demography, and competitive interactions are needed to identify critical life history traits that will influence responses to particular management regimes.

Influence of temperature, photoperiod and humidity on oviposition and egg hatch of the root-feeding flea beetle Longitarsus bethae (Chrysomelidae : Alticinae), a natural enemy of the weed Lantana camara (Verbenaceae)	BULLETIN OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH												The root-feeding flea beetle Longitarsus bethae Savini & Escalona, was introduced into South Africa as a candidate biological control agent for the noxious and invasive weed, Lantana camara L. As part of the study to predict the beetles' survival in its new range, the influence of climatic conditions on its egg development and reproductive performance were investigated in the laboratory. The threshold temperature (T degrees) and degree-days (DD) required for egg hatch were determined after exposing the eggs to various constant temperatures (12, 17, 22, 27 and 32 degrees C) in separate growth chambers. The DD required for egg hatch was 178.6, and the temperature threshold required for egg hatch was 11.3 degrees C. Survival of eggs varied from 27 to 56% at 32 and 17 degrees C, respectively, and was optimum between 17 and 25 degrees C. Oviposition was examined under high and low relative humidity (RH) regimes while egg hatch was determined at six RH levels, each maintained in a separate controlled growth chamber set at a constant temperature (25 degrees C). Whilst RH had no influence on oviposition, eggs were highly susceptible to aridity, and continuous exposure to relative humidity below 63% for more than three days was wholly lethal at 25 degrees C. Optimum egg hatch occurred at RH between 85 and 95% for up to 12 days. The effect of day length on oviposition and subsequent egg hatch was investigated under two photoperiod regimes. Neither oviposition nor subsequent egg hatch was influenced by photoperiod. The knowledge obtained will be useful for mass rearing as well as field release programmes for L. bethae.																	0007-4853					APR	2007	97	2					111	116		10.1017/S0007485307004713								WOS:000246153700001	17411475

This cell generated action potentials of considerably smaller amplitude than those of the salt and pH cells, and phasic-tonically responded to sucrose and glucose over the range of 1-1000 mM tested. Responses were concentration dependent, with sucrose generating more spikes than glucose. During the first second of the response, maximum rates of firing of the sugar cell reached up to 19 and 37 imp/s when stimulated with 1000 mM glucose and Sucrose, respectively. Three to four seconds later, the responses decreased close to zero. Both sugars are important in plant carbohydrate metabolism. These ground dwelling insects may come into contact with live and decayed plant material everywhere in their habitat including their preferred overwintering sites in brown-rot decayed wood. In conclusion, we hypothesize that high content of Soluble sugars in their overwintering sites and refugia is unfavourable for these ground beetles, most probably to avoid contact with dangerous fungi.

Functional divergence in the Arabidopsis beta-1,3-glucanase gene family inferred by phylogenetic reconstruction of expression states	MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Plant beta-1,3-glucanases (beta-1,3-Gs) (E.C. 3.2.1.39) comprise large, highly complex gene families involved in pathogen defense as well as a wide range of normal developmental processes. In spite of previous phylogenetic analyses that classify beta-1,3-Gs by sequence relatedness, the functional evolution of beta-1,3-Gs remains unclear. Here, expression and phylogenetic analyses have been integrated in order to investigate patterns of functional divergence in the Arabidopsis beta-1,3-G gene family. Fifty beta-1,3-G genes were grouped into expression classes through clustering of microarray data, and functions were inferred based on knowledge of coexpressed genes and existing literature. The resulting expression classes were mapped as discrete states onto a phylogenetic tree and parsimony reconstruction of ancestral expression states was performed, providing a model of expression divergence. Results showed a highly nonrandom distribution of developmental expression states in the phylogeny (P = 0.0002) indicating a significant degree of coupling between sequence and developmental expression divergence. A weaker, yet significant level of coupling was found using stress response data, but not using hormone-response or pathogen-response data. According to the model of developmental expression divergence, the ancestral function was most likely involved in cell division and/or cell wall remodeling. The associated expression state is widely distributed in the phylogeny, is retained by over 25% of gene family members, and is consistent with the known functions of beta-1,3-Gs in distantly related species and gene families. Consistent with previous hypotheses, pathogenesis-related (PR) beta-1,3-Gs appear to have evolved from ancestral developmentally regulated beta-1,3-Gs, acquiring PR function through a number of evolutionary events: divergence from the ancestral expression state, acquisition of pathogen/stress-responsive expression patterns, and loss of the C-terminal region including the glycosylphosphatidylinisotol (GPI)-anchoring site thus allowing for extracellular secretion.

We show here that nearly continuous daylight at high latitudes causes a relaxation in diel migratory behaviour in zooplankton irrespective of predation risk. At lower latitudes, however, similar conditions lead to pronounced diel rhythms in migration. Hence, zooplankton may show local behavioural adaptations in their circadian rhythm. They are also able to make risk assessments as to whether diel migration is beneficial or not, manifested in a lack of diel migration at near constant daylight, irrespective of predator presence. Our results provide an additional explanation to previous knowledge regarding diel migrations among aquatic invertebrates by showing that both physical (light) and biological (predation) factors may affect the migratory behaviour.

J	Dawson, A				Dawson, Alistair			Seasonality in a temperate zone bird can be entrained by near equatorial photoperiods	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Birds use photoperiod to control the time of breeding and moult. However, it is unclear whether responses are dependent on absolute photoperiod, the direction and rate of change in photoperiod, or if photoperiod entrains a circannual clock. If starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) are kept on a constant photoperiod of 12 h light:12 h darkness per day (12 L:12 D), then they can show repeated cycles of gonadal maturation, regression and moult, which is evidence for a circannual clock. In this study, starlings kept on constant 11.5 L:12.5 D for 4 years or 12.5 L:11.5 D for 3 years showed no circannual cycles in gonadal maturation or moult. So, if there is a circannual clock, it is overridden by a modest deviation in photoperiod from 12 L:12 D. The responses to 11.5 L:12.5 D and 12.5 L:11.5 D were very different, the former perceived as a short photoperiod (birds were photosensitive for most of the time) and the latter as a long photoperiod (birds remained permanently photorefractory). Starlings were then kept on a schedule which ranged from 11.5 L:12.5 D in mid-winter to 12.5 L:11.5 D in mid-summer (simulating the annual cycle at 9 degrees N) for 3 years. These birds entrained precisely to calendar time and changes in testicular size and moult were similar to those of birds under a simulated cycle at 52 degrees N. These data show that birds are very sensitive to changes in photoperiod but that they do not simply respond to absolute photoperiod nor can they rely on a circannual clock. Instead, birds appear to respond to the shape of the annual change in photoperiod. This proximate control could operate from near equatorial latitudes and would account for similar seasonal timing in individuals of a species over a wide range of latitudes.

J	Frank, AA				Frank, Andrew A.			Plug-in hybrid vehicles for a sustainable future	AMERICAN SCIENTIST												The idea of a hybrid vehicle-one that propels itself using both a conventional engine and an electric motor-is not new. Indeed, some hybrid automobiles were produced more than a century ago, when the internal combustion engine was still in its infancy These cars were designed to address the limited range of existing electric vehicles and the difficulty of starting the early engines, which had to be cranked by hand (a procedure that resulted in not a few broken arms). The early hybrid vehicles, and the purely electric cars that dominated the fledgling automobile industry early in the 20th century, eventually gave way to a proliferation of cars based on the now-ubiquitous internal combustion engine, a development made possible by the relatively low cost and widespread availability of gasoline. As a result the hybrid concept remained dormant until the 1970s, a decade during which the price of a gallon of gas tripled. The higher cost brought to light an inherent problem of using internal combustion engines in cars: inefficiency. For example, until recently it's been universal practice to keep the engine running at all times, even when the car comes to a stop, because having to restart the engine was viewed as problematical. So the engines in our cars are simply idled, which uses fuel to do essentially nothing. Even when the car is moving, much energy is wasted because the engine is usually throttled the amount of air it is allowed to take in is restricted, which lowers power to an appropriate level but also acts to diminish efficiency. What's more, fuel is even consumed in slowing the car, because this is normally done by throttling back the engine after running at speed. Such inefficiencies are not so worrisome for aircraft or ships, which seldom idle and infrequently run at anything other than an optimal speed. But automobiles typically operate at very low power levels. In the city, the average speed of a car is just 19 miles per hours which requires around 9 kilowatts (equivalent to 12 horsepower). Yet the driving public demands rapid acceleration from its cars, which requires something like 150 kilowatts or 200 horsepower. Thus our cars usually operate with their engines throttled way back so as to use only a small fraction of their available power. With highway driving, which uses 12 kilowatts or about 16 horsepower (for a medium-sized sedan cruising at 65 miles per hour), somewhat better fuel economy can be realized. But even at highway speeds, the efficiency is far from what could be achieved were automobile engines not throttled so much.																	0003-0996					MAR-APR	2007	95	2					158	165		10.1511/2007.64.158								WOS:000244195600024

Long-term trends in food habits of a relict brown bear population in northern Spain: the influence of climate and local factors	ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION												Relict endangered populations may be especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change. A data series for the period 1974-2003 was used to examine shifts in brown bear Ursus arctos food habits in its south-westernmost European population. This focused on the hyperphagic season, when bears gain the fat that is essential for winter dormancy and reproduction. General climatic indicators were predictors of diet trends. Other variables potentially able to modify brown bear food habits at the local scale were accounted for by considering two areas where local conditions changed in different ways during the study period. General climatic indicators such as temperature and the winter North Atlantic Oscillation index were good predictors of some diet trends, although local factors seemed to modulate the potential response of food habits to recent climate change. Boreal and temperate food items decreasingly contributed to brown bear diet, replaced by increasing contributions of southern foods, which suggested that warmer temperatures might determine the occurrence of some food items in the diet of Cantabrian brown bears through effects on plant distribution and phenology. At the local scale, high cattle density in one of the study areas limited food sources available for brown bears. Important food sources for brown bears, such as heath-like Vaccinium formations and old-growth oak forest in the Cantabrian Mountains, require increased levels of protection.

Phenology model from surface meteorology does not capture satellite-based greenup estimations	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Seasonal temperature change in temperate forests is known to trigger the start of spring growth, and both interannual and spatial variations in spring onset have been tied to climatic variability. Satellite dates are increasingly being used in phenology studies, but to date that has been little effort to link remotely sensed phenology to surface climate records. In this research, we use a two-parameter spring warming phenology model to explore the relationship between climate and satellite-based phenology. We employ daily air temperature records between 2000 and 2005 for 171 National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration weather stations located throughout New England to construct spring warming models predicting the onset of spring, as defined by the date of half-maximum greenness (D-50) in deciduous forests as detected from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer. The best spring warming model starts accumulating temperatures after March 20th and when average daily temperatures exceed 5 degrees C. The accumulated heat sums [heating degree day (HDD)] required to reach D-50 range from 150 to 300 degree days over New England, with the highest requirements to the south and in coastal regions. We test the ability of the spring warming model to predict phenology against a null photoperiod model (average date of onset). The spring warming model offers little improvement on the null model when predicting D-50. Differences between the efficacies of the two models are expressed as the 'climate sensitivity ratio' (CSR), which displays coherent spatial patterns. Our results suggest that northern (beech-maple-birch) and central (oak-hickory) hardwood forests respond to climate differently, particularly with disparate requirements for the minimum temperature necessary to begin spring growth (3 and 6 degrees C, respectively). We conclude that spatial location and species composition are critical factors for predicting the phenological response to climate change: satellite observations cannot be linked directly to temperature variability if species or community compositions are unknown.

A climate-driven phenology model previously used in North America was applied to New Zealand. Weather and elevation data were used as inputs to predict where sustainable populations could potentially exist and predict the timing of hatch and oviposition in different regions. Results for New Zealand were compared with those in the Canadian Maritimes (New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island) where the gypsy moth has long been established. Model results agree with the current distribution of the gypsy moth in the Canadian Maritimes and predict that the majority of New Zealand's North Island and the northern coastal regions of the South Island have a suitable climate to allow stable seasonality of the gypsy moth. New Zealand's climate appears more forgiving than that of the Canadian Maritimes, as the model predicts a wider range of oviposition dates leading to stable seasonality. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of climate change on the predicted potential distribution for New Zealand. Climate change scenarios show an increase in probability of establishment throughout New Zealand, most noticeably in the South Island.

Ecology and behavior of the Midget Faded Rattlesnake (Crotalus oreganus concolor) in Wyoming	JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY												We conducted a three-year study to describe the ecology and behavior of the Midget Faded Rattlesnake, Crotalus organus concolor. We encountered 426 and telemetered 50 C. o. concolor between 2000 and 2002. We found that their primary diet was lizards (associated with rock outcrops), though they will consume small mammals and birds. They den in aggregations, although in low numbers when compared to other subspecies. Movements and activity ranges were among the largest reported for rattlesnakes. Minimum convex polygon area was 117.8 ha for males, 63.9 ha for nongravid females, and 4.8 ha for gravid females. Mean distances traveled per year were 2122.0 m for males, 1956.0 m for nongravid females, and 296.7 m for gravid and postpartum females. Following emergence from hibernation, they spent several weeks shedding, often in aggregations before migration, and migrations occurred in early summer. Most snakes made straight-line movements to and from discrete summer activity ranges where short, multidirectional movements ensued, although others made multidirectional movements throughout the active season. We observed mating behavior between 21 July and 12 August. Gravid females gave birth during the third week of August. Mean clutch size was 4.17 (range 2-7). We found that the sex ratio was skewed favoring females 1:1.24, and they were sexually dimorphic in size (males SVL = 44.1 cm; females SVL = 40.8 cm). Our data further illustrate the diversity within the large group of Western Rattlesnakes (Crotalus viridis).																	0022-1511					MAR	2007	41	1					41	51		10.1670/0022-1511(2007)41[41:EABOTM]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000245261700006

The effect of aqueous smoke solution in overcoming the light requirement for germination, and the potential of visible (VIS) and near infrared reflectance (NIR) spectroscopy for sorting sound and insect-damaged seeds were also investigated. Highly significant differences in germination were detected among provenances (P < 0.0001) and stratification periods (P < 0.0001), but not between temperature regimes (P = 0.111). Seeds from the south and southeast distribution ranges had higher percentage germination after 6 weeks of stratification than seeds collected from north, northwest and central ranges of distribution. The smoke treatment did not affect germination regardless of whether the seeds were exposed to light. Exposure to light increased germination capacity three fold. Sound and damaged seeds were distinguished with 90% accuracy using VIS + NIR spectroscopy. It can be concluded that dormancy in juniper seeds varies with provenances, and cold stratification for 6 weeks alleviates dormancy in some seed lots. Tentatively, smoke treatment seems ineffective in overcoming photo-dormancy in juniper seeds. VIS + NIR spectroscopy has demonstrated a great potential for sorting damaged seeds, thereby upgrading seed lot purity.

J	Musolin, DL; Fujisaki, K; Numata, H				Musolin, Dmitry L.; Fujisaki, Kenji; Numata, Hideharu			Photoperiodic control of diapause termination, colour change and postdiapause reproduction in the southern green stink bug, Nezara viridula	PHYSIOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												The effects of day length on adult diapause development, associated with diapause body colour change as well as postdiapause reproduction are studied in Nezara viridula from Japan. Facultative diapause spontaneously terminates under three constant short-day and near-critical photoperiods at 25 degrees C without low temperature treatment. The period required for body colour change from russet to green and the precopulation and preoviposition periods differ significantly between the photoperiodic treatments, being shortest under LD 13 : 11 h, intermediate under LD 12 : 12 h and longest under LD 10 : 14 h. Photoperiodic conditions do not affect postdiapause reproductive performance: the total egg production, duration of the period of oviposition and other reproductive indices do not differ significantly between the photoperiodic conditions. The total egg production depends on the duration of the period of oviposition but not on how long females remained russet during diapause. It is concluded that diapause in N. viridula does not require low temperature for its successful completion and diapause duration affects winter survival but not postdiapause reproductive performance or longevity. Such independence of the postdiapause reproductive performance from the duration of diapause may have contributed to the continuous worldwide range expansion of this species into temperate zone.

Cooling rates and body temperature regulation of hibernating echidnas (Tachyglossus aculeatus)	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY												Echidnas (Tachyglossus aculeatus) are amongst the largest deep hibernators, but it is difficult to get them to hibernate normally under laboratory conditions. We measured body temperature (T-b) in 14 free-ranging echidnas using implanted data-loggers. Cooling during entry into hibernation bouts followed a Newtonian cooling curve, and conductances calculated from cooling curves were identical to those observed in cold exposed euthermic echidnas. Comparison with a reference soil temperature demonstrated that echidnas showed behavioural thermoregulation during hibernation; early in the hibernation season echidnas preferred to hibernate in cool areas, while during the coldest months they moved to warmer hibernacula, giving a preferred T-b in the range 8-10 degrees C. Thermal buffering against excessive variation in T-b may be as important as maintaining a low T-b.																	0022-0949					FEB 15	2007	210	4					586	592		10.1242/jeb.02701								WOS:000244632700009	17267644					
J	Chen, XY; Mulder, J				Chen, Xi Yun; Mulder, Jan			Indicators for nitrogen status and leaching in subtropical forest ecosystems, South China	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												The deposition of nitrogen (N) is high in subtropical forest in South China and it is expected to increase further in the coming decades. To assess effects of increasing deposition on N cycling, we investigated the current N status of two selected 40-45-year-old masson pine-dominated Chinese subtropical forest stands at Tieshanping (TSP, near Chongqing City) and Caijiatang (CJT in Shaoshan, Hunan province), and explored the applicability of several indicators for N status and leaching, suggested for temperate and boreal forest ecosystems. Current atmospheric N deposition to the systems is from 25 to 49 kg ha(-1) year(-1). The concentration of total N in the upper 15 cm of the soil is from as low as 0.05% in the B-2 horizon to as high as 0.53% in the O/A horizon. The concentration of organic carbon (C) varies from 0.74 (B-2) to 9.54% (O/A). Pools of N in the upper 15 cm of the soils range from 1460 to 2290 kg N ha(-1), where 25-55% of the N pool is in the O/A horizon (upper 3 cm of the soil). Due to a lack of a well-developed continuous O horizon (forest floor), the C/N ratio of this layer cannot be used as an indicator for the N status, as is commonly done in temperate and boreal forests. The net N mineralization rate (mg N g(-1) C year(-1)) in individual horizons correlates significantly with the C/N ratio, which is from as high as 18.2 in the O/A horizon to as low as 11.2 in the B-2 horizon. The N2O emission flux from soil is significantly correlated with the KCl extractable NH4+-N in the O/A horizon and with the net nitrification in the upper 15 cm of the soil. However, the spatial and temporal variation of the N2O emission rate is high and rates are small and often difficult to detect in the field. The soil flux density of mineral N, defined as the sum of the throughfall N input rate and the rate of in situ net N mineralization in the upper 15 cm of the soil, i.e., the combination of deposition input and the N status of the system, explains the NO3- leaching potential at 30 cm soil depth best. The seasonality of stream water N concentration at TSP and CJT is climatic and hydrologically controlled, with highest values commonly occurring in the wet growing season and lowest in the dry dormant season. This is different from temperate forest ecosystems, where N saturation is indicated by elevated NO3- leaching in stream water during summer.																	0168-2563					FEB	2007	82	2					165	180		10.1007/s10533-006-9061-3								WOS:000243554400005

Seasonal timing of diapause induction limits the effective range of Diorhabda elongata deserticola (Coleoptera : Chrysomelidae) as a biological control agent for tamarisk (Tamarix spp.)	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												The leaf beetle Diorhabda elongata Brulle subspecies deserticola Chen, collected in northwestern China, has been released in the western United States to control tamarisk (Tamarix spp.). While beetle establishment and saltcedar defoliation have been noted at northern study sites, this species has not established at latitudes south of the 38th parallel. Critical daylength for diapause induction was measured in the laboratory and ranged between 14 h 50 min to 15 h 08 min, depending on temperature, and adults were shown to cease reproduction and enter diapause at daylengths of 14 h 30 min or less. Critical daylength in the field was measured at approximate to 14 h 39 min and occurred 13 d before 50% of the population reached diapause. South of 36 degrees 20' N, the longest days of the year are shorter than 14 h 39 min, making the beetles univoltine in the southern United States. North of 36 degrees 20' N, a window of reproductive activity opens 13 d after the critical daylength is reached in the spring and closes 13 d after it is passed in the summer, allowing at least a partial second summer generation. It is predicted that south of the 38th parallel, premature diapause will increase mortality and disrupt synchrony between the life cycle of the beetle and host plant availability. This could hinder establishment and help explain the failure of this population south of the 38th parallel, providing a rationale for testing other populations of D. elongata in the southern range of Tamarix in North America.																	0046-225X					FEB	2007	36	1					15	25		10.1603/0046-225X(2007)36[15:STODIL]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000244116100003	17349111					
J	Yu, SL; Sternberg, M; Kutiel, P; Chen, HW				Yu, Shunli; Sternberg, Marcelo; Kutiel, Pua; Chen, Hongwei			Seed mass, shape, and persistence in the soil seed bank of Israeli coastal sand dune flora	EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH												Question: Are seed mass and shape related to persistence in the soil seed bank among 54 species of the Israeli flora? Search method: Persistence was determined by soil seed bank investigations in which the fraction of non-germinated viable seeds was regarded as the persistent soil seed bank. When seedling emergence had ceased but before new seeds were shed, all soil from the upper 5 cm of 120 quadrats was removed to the laboratory. At that time, the seeds sampled were those from previous seed rains. Data description: Plant species with persistent and transient seeds were widely scattered across the range of seed mass or dimension and variances. A significant relationship was found between seed mass (or dimension) and seed persistence with persistent seeds tending to have larger mass. However, no significant relationship was found between seed shape and seed persistence. Species with persistent seeds had significantly higher seed mass than those with transient seeds (one-tailed t-test = 1.68, n = 48, P = 0.007), but there was no significant difference in shape between them (one-tailed t-test = 1.68, n = 48, P = 0.076; t-test = 1.68, n = 45, P = 0.124). Species with persistent seeds yielded significantly higher seed dimensions than those with transient seeds (one-tailed t-test = 1.95, n = 48, P = 0.029). In this study, there was no threshold in seed mass (or dimension) and shape that distinguished transient from persistent seeds. Conclusions: Species with persistent seeds have significantly larger seeds than species with transient seeds. However, species with small and/or round persistent seeds were relatively common. The underlying mechanism proposed for the observed pattern is a high proportion of large-seeded, persistent species with hard seed coat dormancy and abundant litter on the surface of the soil. Data from all eight floras studied to date suggest that significant differences in climate may determine diverse patterns in the relationships between seed mass and shape and persistence. Small and compact seeds are likely to occur in soil seed banks in humid climates, whereas large-seeded species with persistent seed banks are more likely to be abundant in arid climates. In addition, the importance of the spatial scale of investigations (or the range of habitats) is emphasized for studying the relationships between seed mass and shape and persistence.																	1522-0613					FEB	2007	9	2					325	340										WOS:000245084600008

We studied variation in the mitochondrial COI (mtCOI) gene of adult R. appendiculatus ticks originating from the Eastern and Southern provinces of Zambia. Rhipicephalus appendiculatus ticks from the two provinces were placed into two groups on the mtCOI sequence data tree. One group comprised all haplotypes of specimens from the Eastern province plateau districts of Chipata and Petauke. The second group consisted of a single haplotype of specimens from the Southern province districts and Nyimba, an Eastern province district on the fringes of the valley. This variation provides additional evidence to the earlier observations in the 12S rDNA and ITS2 data for the geographic subdivision of R. appendiculatus from Southern province and Eastern province plateau. The geographic subdivision further corresponds with differences in body size and diapause between R. appendiculatus from these geographic areas. The possible implications of these findings on the epidemiology of East Coast fever (ECF) the disease for which R. appendiculatus is one of the vectors are discussed.

Detection and resolution of genetic loci affecting circadian period in Brassica oleracea	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS												Circadian rhythms regulate many aspects of plant growth, fitness and vigour. The components and detailed mechanism of circadian regulation to date have been dissected in the reference species Arabidopsis thaliana. To determine the genetic basis and range of natural allelic variation for intrinsic circadian period in the closest crop relatives, we used an accurate and high throughput data capture system to record rhythmic cotyledon movement in two immortal segregating populations of Brassica oleracea, derived from parent lines representing different crop types. Periods varied between 24.4 and 26.1 h between the parent lines, with transgressive segregation between extreme recombinant lines in both populations of similar to 3.5 h. The additive effect of individual QTL identified in each population varied from 0.17 to 0.36 h. QTL detected in one doubled haploid population were verified and the mapping intervals further resolved by determining circadian period in genomic substitution lines derived from the parental lines. Comparative genomic analysis based on collinearity between Brassica and Arabidopsis also allowed identification of candidate orthologous genes known to regulate period in Arabidopsis, that may account for the additive circadian effects of specific QTL. The distinct QTL positions detected in the two populations, and the extent of transgressive segregation suggest that there is likely to be considerable scope for modulating the range of available circadian periods in natural populations and crop species of Brassica. This may provide adaptive advantage for optimising growth and development in different latitudes, seasons or climate conditions.

First demonstration of the influence of photoperiod on the thermal requirements for development in insects and in particular the linden-bug, Pyrrhocoris apterus (Heteroptera : Pyrrhocoridae)	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY												The influence of photoperiod on the thermal requirements for development was discovered for the first time in insects during experiments on the linden-bug, Pyrrhocoris apterus. The effect of photoperiod on the duration of linden-bug development at five constant temperatures (20, 22, 24, 26 and 28 degrees C) was measured and the thermal requirements for development at three photoperiods (14, 17 and 20 h light per day) were calculated. Bugs from four geographic populations were used in these experiments: Pyatigorsk (44 degrees 02'N, 43 degrees 04'E), Borisovka (50 degrees 36'N, 36 degrees 01'E), Mikhailov (54 degrees 15'N, 39 degrees 0'E) and Ryazan (54 degrees 36'N, 39 degrees 42'E). From the values of individual development times at different temperatures the coefficient of linear regression of development rate (the inverse of the duration) on temperature and the thermal threshold for development were calculated. Both these parameters were found to decrease significantly with decrease in day-length for all four populations studied. It means that at shorter day-lengths nymphal development is less dependent on temperature compared to the development at longer day-lengths. These effects seem to be adaptive. The development times of nymphs at relatively high temperatures (above 24-25 degrees C) are shorter under long-days than under short days which should be advantageous at the height of summer when the days are long and the weather is warm. In the contrast, at relatively low temperatures (below 24-25 degrees C) the nymphs develop significantly faster under short-days than under long days, which is advantageous at the end of summer as it allows the nymphs to reach the adult stage, the only stage capable of overwintering. The influence of photoperiod on the thermal reaction norm appeared to be more or less gradual, i.e. the shorter the day-length the shallower the slope of the regression line of development rate on temperature and the lower the thermal threshold for development. An analysis of the literature shows that this effect of photoperiod on the thermal requirements for development is widespread among insects but has been overlooked by previous authors. The authors conclude that the variation in the development time observed in insects at different seasons, photoperiods or food regimes, or from different populations, etc., are generally due to some modification of the thermal reaction norms and more specifically to differences in the thermal requirements for development.

Because fire behavior is related to fire effects on vegetation, validation of computer models will help understand possible outcomes and increase planning efficacy. Better predictions of fire behavior also will aid in management of risk associated with prescribed burning. We compared fire behavior predicted with BEHAVE, fire behavior and fuel modeling system, using standard and site-specific customized fuel models with observed fire behavior of strip headfires. These fires were observed in shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata)-dominated stands managed as pine-grassland stands for the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis). We evaluated the accuracy of fuel models across different seasons and fire return intervals. Fuels in all stands tended to be heterogeneous and discontinuous, with fuel loads differing considerably between growing and dormant seasons and time since burned both in weight and composition. Fuel models varied in accuracy depending on fuel loading and season of fire. Therefore, multiple fuel models were required to more accurately characterize fire behavior across fire seasons and fire return intervals. All fuel models failed to produce accurate predictions for fireline intensity and rate of spread. All fuel models tended to overpredict fireline intensity on low-intensity fires and underpredict fireline intensity on high-intensity fires. The firing pattern we chose may have influenced the accuracy of predictions, but we were unable to detect appreciable changes in wind speed due to presumed convective influences of backing and headfires approaching each other. Additional BEHAVE fuel models for a wider range of fuel conditions show some promise in providing managers with more realistic predictions of fire behavior under variable fuel conditions. However, field validation for specific sites is imperative.																	0082-1527						2007		23					170	180										WOS:000274198800035

Evolution of animal photoperiodism	ANNUAL REVIEW OF ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS	Annual Review of Ecology Evolution and Systematics											Photoperiodism is the ability of organisms to assess and use the day length as an anticipatory cue to time seasonal events in their life histories. Photoperiodism is especially important in initiating physiological and developmental processes that are typically irrevocable and that culminate at a future time or at a distant place; the further away in space or time, the more likely a seasonal event is initiated by photoperiod. The pervasiveness of photoperiodism across broad taxa, from rotifers to rodents, and the predictable changes of photoperiodic response with geography identify it as a central component of fitness in temperate and polar seasonal environments. Consequently, the role of day length cannot be disregarded when evaluating the mechanisms underlying life-historical events, range expansions, invasions of novel species, and response to climate change among animals in the temperate and polar regions of the world.																	1543-592X	1545-2069					2007	38						1	25		10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.37.091305.110115								WOS:000252359800001

Effect of light intensity on the oviposition rhythm of the altitudinal strains of Drosophila ananassae	CHRONOBIOLOGY INTERNATIONAL												The sensitivity of the circadian photoreceptors mediating entrainment of the eclosion rhythm and phase shifts of oviposition rhythm of the high altitude (HA) strain of Drosophila ananassae originating from Badrinath (5123 m above sea level) in the Himalayas was compared with the low altitude (LA) strain from Firozpur (179 m above sea level). Reduced photic sensitivity of the HA strain is regarded as the result of natural selection, which led to the weakening of the coupling mechanism between the circadian pacemaker and light at the high altitude of origin. The present study was designed to determine whether or not the photic entrainment of the oviposition rhythm of the HA strain of D. ananassae is also altered by the high altitude of its origin, and the results are compared with those of the LA strain. The effects of light intensity on the phase angle difference (psi), degree of rhythmicity (R), the percent oviposition in photophase, the threshold light intensity (i.e., the intensity at which stable entrainment occurred), and the saturation light intensity (i.e., the intensity beyond which the values of 41 or amplitude of rhythm remained unaltered) were determined. Entrainment was studied in light-dark cycles in which the light intensity of 12 h of photophase varied from 1 to 1000 lux, and complete darkness prevailed in all scotophases. The oviposition rhythm of the HA strain was arrhythmic from 1 to 90 lux, weakly rhythmic at 95 lux, but rhythmic at or above 100 lux, while that of the LA strain was weakly rhythmic at I lux but rhythmic at or above 2 lux. Oviposition of the HA strain occurred mostly in the photophase, while that of the LA strain occurred in the scotophase; as a result, the oviposition medians of the HA strain were around the subjective forenoons while those of the LA strain were around the subjective evenings. The percent of oviposition in photophase increased from 68 to 98 in the HA strain and from 5 to 33 in the LA strain as light intensity increased from 1 to 1000 lux. In the HA strain, the psi values were significantly less and values of R and percent oviposition in photophase were significantly more than those of the 1A strain at each level of light intensity. Threshold and saturation intensities for psi were 100 and 700 lux, respectively, for the HA strain, but just 2 and 45 lux, respectively, for the LA strain.

J	Benedito-Silva, AA; Pires, MLN; Calil, HM				Benedito-Silva, Ana Amelia; Pires, Maria Laura Nogueira; Calil, Helena Maria			Seasonal variation of suicide in Brazil	CHRONOBIOLOGY INTERNATIONAL												Most of what is known about the seasonal variation in suicide rate originates from studies conducted in the northern hemisphere; very few studies have been done in the southern hemisphere. The purpose of the present study was to explore the possibility that in Brazil, the seasonal variation of suicides is a function of photoperiod. This was accomplished by analyzing monthly suicide data for a 12 yr period (1979 to 1990), within latitudes ranging from 2 degrees N to 33 degrees S. Single cosinor analyses with periods of 12 or 6 months were applied to time series of monthly total and suicidal deaths, separated by gender and state. Significant spring or early summer peaks of suicide were found only in the south of Brazil for both men and women, except for the latter in one state. These peaks did not coincide with those found for total deaths, which occurred in the autumn or winter in all areas. No significant six-month period was found. In the present study, the chance of a suicide was typically 10-17% higher during the peak period than during the other months of the year. Although this moderate seasonal effect might not be sufficient to justify planning large scale prophylactic interventions, those dealing with patients who have suicide ideation should be aware of this high risk time.

Circadian entrainment of Neurospora crassa	COLD SPRING HARBOR SYMPOSIA ON QUANTITATIVE BIOLOGY					72nd Cold Spring Harbor Symposium on Quantitative Biology	MAY   30, 2007	Cold Spring Harbor, NY	NCI, Pfizer, Abbott Labs, Appl Biosyst, BioVentures, Bristol Myers Squibb, Diagnost Prod Corp, Forest Labs, GE Healthcare Bio Sci, Genetech, Hoffmann La Rouche, Amgen, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck Res Labs, Novartis Inst BioMed Res, Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceut Res & Dev, LLC, Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co Ltd, New England BioLabs, OSI Pharmaceut, Pall Corp, Sanofi Aventis Schering Plough Res Inst				The circadian clock evolved under entraining conditions, yet most circadian experiments and much circadian theory are built around free-running rhythms. The interpretation of entrainment experiments is certainly more complex than that of free-running rhythms due to the relationship between exogenous and endogenous cycles. Here, we systematically describe entrainment in the simplest of the traditional eukaryotic model systems in circadian research, Neurospora crassa. This fungus forms a mass of spores (bands of conidia) each day. Over a wide range of photoperiods, these bands begin to appear at midnight, Suggesting integration of neither dawn nor dusk signals alone. However, when symmetrical light/dark cycles (T cycles, each with 50% light) are applied, dusk determines the time of conidiation with a uniform, period-dependent delay in phase. This "forced" synchronization appears to be specific for the zeitgeber light because similar experiments, but using temperature, result in systematic entrainment, with bands appearing relatively later in shorter cycles and earlier in longer cycles. We find that the molecular mechanism of entrainment primarily concerns posttranscriptional regulation. Finally, we have used Neurospora to investigate acute effects of zeitgeber Stimuli known as "masking."																	0091-7451						2007	72						279	285		10.1101/sqb.2007.72.032								WOS:000257193300030	18419284

Temporal variation in food resources determines onset of breeding in an Australian mistletoe specialist	EMU												Temporal variation in the onset of breeding has been described for various species in a range of systems. Many of these studies have found a relationship between the timing of breeding and resource levels leading to a matching of life-history stages to resource abundance. However, most of this work has been conducted in northern hemisphere temperate zones - highly regular systems where temperature and other climatic factors have a predictable influence over food abundance. We present data gathered over two years on the timing of breeding in a nomadic mistletoe specialist, the Painted Honeyeater (Grantiella picta), relative to temporal variation in the abundance of its main food resource, fruit of the Grey Mistletoe (Amyema quandang), in an Australian semi-arid environment. Arrival and departure of the breeding population occurred either side of peak mistletoe fruiting in both years. Clutches were initiated on average on Day 66 of the breeding season (assigned as 1 October for both years) in 2004 (5 December) and Day 49 (18 November) during 2005, i.e. 17 days earlier in 2005. Abundance of mistletoe fruit peaked in January in both years but increased significantly earlier in 2005. Abundance of fruit was almost identical at the mean clutch initiation dates in both years, reaching comparable levels 19 days earlier in 2005. The timing of life-history stages followed the progression of fruiting phenology and was closely matched to resource levels despite marked differences in the temporal availability of fruit between years. Painted Honey-eaters appear similar to northern hemisphere passerines that use photoperiod to time their overall breeding season and then incorporate information from the local environment to fine-tune initiation of breeding. By cuing directly on the food resource, Painted Honeyeaters may avoid temporal mismatching in this highly unpredictable environment.

J	Shefferson, RP; Tali, K				Shefferson, Richard P.; Tali, Kadri			Dormancy is associated with decreased adult survival in the burnt orchid, Neotinea ustulata	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 Prolonged dormancy, a condition in which herbaceous perennial plants do not sprout for more than a year, has only been described to any great extent in long-lived clonal species, particularly in the family Orchidaceae. However, some short-lived, partly clonal or non-clonal perennials also experience dormancy, and their shorter life spans and reduced or absent clonality may change the life history costs and benefits of this phenomenon. 2 We explored the life history context of dormancy in one such plant, Neotinea ustulata. A total of 1013 plants were monitored in five populations across Estonia between 1993 and 2005. Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) and multistate analyses, two statistical methods to estimate demographic parameters in open populations, were conducted to estimate the probabilities of survival, dormancy and state transition among flowering, vegetative and dormant states among the populations. 3 The best-fit CJS model suggested that dormancy varied among populations unpredictably, while survival varied in parallel among populations across time. Mean survival was 0.727 +/- 0.115 (+/- SE) and mean dormancy was 0.543 +/- 0.129. 4 Multi-state analyses suggested that survival varied in parallel with life history state across all populations, with flowering plants surviving almost completely (0.999 +/- 0.007) and dormant plants being the least likely to survive (0.684 +/- 0.042). Vegetative plants were found to be intermediate (0.793 +/- 0.051). All plants were likely to revert to a dormant state (range 0.451 +/- 0.085-0.812 +/- 0.053). 5 Dormancy appears to be maladaptive in N. ustulata, although we suggest that it may still be adaptive as a bet-hedging trait if it results in substantially lower variability in survival and fitness over the long term. We suggest that conservation measures aimed at preserving populations of dormancy-prone plants be linked to censuses focusing on detecting and estimating dormancy levels because high levels of dormancy indicate a low annual survival.																	0022-0477					JAN	2007	95	1					217	225		10.1111/j.1365-2745.2006.01195.x								WOS:000242791300021

Long day plants and the response to global warming: rapid evolutionary change in day length sensitivity is possible in wild beet	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY												Day length is a key factor in flowering induction in many plant species in a seasonal environment with flowering induction usually happening at shorter day lengths in lower latitudes. Now, the climate changes systematically at a considerable speed due to global warming. As a consequence, earlier flowering will be selected for in long day plants by favouring a lower threshold for day length sensitivity, on the condition of available genetic variability. Here, we show that there is considerable genetic variation for day length sensitivity in our study species, the seabeet Beta vulgaris subsp. maritima. In the northernmost natural populations without vernalization requirement, in southwest France, the necessary day length for flowering induction could be reduced by artificial selection in < 10 generations from > 13 h to < 11 h, the latter value corresponding to populations in the Beta-species complex from Northern Africa and the eastern part of the Mediterranean tested under the same conditions. A quantitative genetic analysis provided evidence of a gradual change without detectable major genes. Additional experiments were carried out to separate the response to photoperiod from age and energy effects. A certain effect of energy availability has been found, whereas age effects could be excluded. These results indicate a considerable potential for evolutionary change in adjusting flowering time in a changing climate.

The aim of this study was to compare the activity period of the diurnal golden lion tamarins with the home range of each group, and the sleeping sites used by tamarins in the Uniao Biological Reserve. Two groups (Geni and SJ2) were followed monthly from April 2003 to March 2004, for a total of 712 h. The daily distance and the home range of the groups were estimated, the trees used as sleeping sites were marked with numbered tags, and the habitat and the positions of the trees were mapped. During the study, the mean daily activity period was 10.30 h. The SJ2 group had a home range of 96.22 ha and 21 different sleeping sites, and the Geni group had a home range of 72.52 ha and nine different tree hole sleeping sites. The daily activity of golden lion tamarins varied seasonally and was associated with photoperiod and temperature. The size of the home range may be influenced by the occurrence and interaction with neighboring groups.																	0025-1461	1864-1547					2007	71	3					131	137		10.1515/MAMM.2007.027								WOS:000250699300005						
J	Kauhala, K; Holmala, K; Schregel, J				Kauhala, Kaarina; Holmala, Katja; Schregel, Julia			Seasonal. activity patterns and movements of the raccoon dog, a vector of diseases and parasites, in southern Finland	MAMMALIAN BIOLOGY												Activity patterns and movements of raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides) were studied in Virolahti, southeast Finland, in 2000-2003. Activity data were compared to those collected from Evo, south-central Finland, in 1990-1993. Activity in winter was compared to weather (temperature and snow depth), day Length and moon. Also circadian activity rhythm was studied in Evo. Raccoon dogs moved fastest in Late winter after winter dormancy and slowest in autumn before settling in their winter dens. In March, males were moving more often than females. Raccoon dogs stayed usually in their dens in mid-winter (December-February) but were sometimes wandering around also during the harshest months of the year and changed their winter den on average three times. Both day Length and weather affected the activity of raccoon dogs in winter. Animals usually stayed in their dens, when temperature was below -10 degrees C, snow depth > 35 cm and day Length < 7 h and were moving around, when temperature was > 0 degrees C, there was no snow and day Length was > 10 h. Day length and snow depth together predicted rather well the probability of animals being active during winter. Although raccoon dogs were more often active at night than during the light hours, they also showed rather much diurnal activity. (c) 2006 Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Saugetierkunde.

Temporal variation in the symbiosis and growth of the temperate scleractinian coral Astrangia poculata	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Seasonal variation in the algal symbiosis and growth of Astrangia poculata, a facultatively symbiotic temperate scleractinian, was explored in Rhode Island, USA. Coral pigmentation and growth were measured simultaneously and repeatedly in both zooxanthellate (corals with symbionts) and azooxanthellate (symbiont free) colonies at 2 sites (similar to 10 km apart) over a 15 mo period using non-destructive digital image analysis methods. A chlorophyll density proxy based on coral pigmentation was derived from multivariate analysis of color data from coral images, and polyps were enumerated to measure colony growth. Among zooxanthellate corals, predicted chlorophyll density exhibited significant seasonal fluctuations that were positively related to temperature, with maxima occurring (luring late summer and early autumn. Pigmentation dynamics in azooxanthellate corals were more variable, although many of these corals displayed temporal fluctuations in pigmentation. Growth also exhibited seasonal fluctuations positively related to temperature, and ceased during the coldest 3 to 4 mo of the year. Corals lost live polyps during the winter as a result of tissue thinning and dormancy, which rendered the colony unable to fend off settling organisms. Although zooxanthellate colonies were able to grow faster than azooxanthellate colonies, coral pigmentation explained only 23 % of the variation in growth rate, emphasizing the importance of heterotrophy as the primary source of nutrition for A. poculata at this northern margin of its range.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2007	348						161	172		10.3354/meps07050								WOS:000251203500013						
J	Johnson, CL				Johnson, Catherine L.			Retention of dormant copepods in deep basins of the Southern California Bight	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The vertical distribution and abundance of dormant Calanus pacificus were described in deep basins and at deep, non-basin locations in waters off Southern California in October 1999 and 2000 and January 1999. Dormant C. pacificus were present in deep water at all stations sampled. In each month, Vertical distributions were similar across the region sampled. The abundance of dormant C. pacificus was higher and their depth range was broader and deeper in October than in January. There was no difference in the abundance of dormant C. pacificus in basins and at deep, non-basin locations in October. Except for the Santa Barbara Basin, Southern California Bight basins were too deep relative to the vertical distribution of dormant C. pacificus to trap dormant copepods. Migration to deep water during dormancy in this region removes copepods from equatorward flow in surface waters. Dormant copepods are exposed either to poleward flow at the shallow end of their depth range in the continental borderlands of Southern California, or to very low current velocities in deeper water, both at basin and non-basin locations. The broad horizontal distribution of dormant C. pacificus in this region implies that non-point sources are dominant in re-seeding surface waters at the end of the dormant season.																	0171-8630						2007	336						203	210		10.3354/meps336203								WOS:000246980400018

Summer Tourism in Austria and Climate Change	MODSIM 2007: INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION: LAND, WATER AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT: INTEGRATED SYSTEMS FOR SUSTAINABILITY					International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM07)	DEC 10-13, 2007	Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND	Lincoln Univ, HEMA Consulting Pty Ltd, Modelling and Simulat Soc Australia & New Zealand (MSSANZ), Univ Canterbury, SGI, Lincoln Ventures Ltd, Hoare Res Software Ltd, IMACS, IEMSS, Environm Modelling & Software, IBM				Weather and climate as well as topographical and orographical conditions, vegetation and fauna play a prominent part in the assessment of tourism and leisure facilities. However, they are limiting and controlling factors, too. Therefore climate change will have considerable consequences on summer tourism in Austria. But of course additionally, several other factors for tourism play a significant role: starting from the weather conditions at home and the weather experience of the last holidays to the variety of activities, advertising campaigns and last but not least costs and prices. Some existing studies take into account all the influencing factors. In the present contribution the main issue was set on the variability of weather and climate conditions of specific destination areas and secondly on a subjective assessment of the climate sensitivity of different kind of holidays. An analysis of relevant meteorological and climatological parameters for tourism climatology and human biometeorology is based on climate conditions for 1961 - 1990 and scenarios of the period 2021 - 2050 calculated by the Max-Planck-Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg. We used the A1B emission scenario. The contribution is focussed on the thermal - bioclimate and on precipitation conditions, because these parameters represent the most important factors for tourism and recreation. Instead of the often used monthly average values, the frequencies of these parameters are calculated in the high temporal resolution of 10 days - each month is divided into three time intervals. To describe the thermal facet of the climate for tourism purposes we used the physiologically equivalent temperature PET, which considers the influence of the complete thermal environment (i.e. air temperature, air humidity, wind velocity as well as short and long-wave radiation) on humans. The frequency of certain PET classes quantifies thermal suitable conditions for leisure and recreation and gives information about cold and heat stress. Additionally the term, "Sultriness" is calculated with the classical criterion of the excess of a certain water vapour pressure. For qualifying the aesthetic facet we used factors such as duration of sunshine, cloudiness and fog, range of visibility and day length. We integrated this aspect with the amount of cloudless or bright days as well as with the number of days with fog. The factors high wind velocity and precipitation (days with few or no rain as well as long lasting precipitation events) specify the physical facet, which comprises influences such as wind, rain, snow conditions, air quality and extreme weather situations. For Austria it can be expected that in the future (2021-2050) the summer tourism period will start earlier and end later in the year than now. The period for recreation and leisure will be extended, also the spring and fall months will offer comfortable thermal conditions for outdoor activities. However, this positive trend is opposed by an increase of frequency and intensity of heat stress and by an increase of days with sultriness in areas below 1000 m above sea level. It is also likely that there will occur a slight increase of days with longer rain events. The decrease of the amount of days with light or no rain will not be able to compensate that. The Climatic Tourism Information Scheme CTIS which we developed gives an overall view on the climatic conditions on a certain location and makes it also possible to compare the present situation with the future.

Activity ranges and habitat use of Lampropeltis getula getula (Eastern Kingsnakes)	NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST												The habitat use and activity range of Lampropeltis getula getula (Eastern Kingsnake) in the New Jersey Pine Barrens were studied from 1996-1998. Five male and four non-gravid female Eastern Kingsnakes were routinely radiotracked during daylight hours during one or two active seasons. Habitat and climatic conditions at snake locations were characterized using 9 climatic and 14 structural habitat features. Multivariate statistical comparisons with randomly selected locations indicated that Eastern Kingsnakes use available habitat in a non-random fashion with respect to microhabitat features (Wilks' lambda = 0.511; df = 28, 1066; P < 0.01). Eastern Kingsnakes preferred sites with thick leaf litter and dense shrub-layer foliage. They used a broad range of macrohabitats that spanned both wetland and pine-dominated upland areas. Moist areas were used for hibernation. Snakes exhibited a largely fossorial lifestyle, spending a great proportion of their time concealed under the cover of soil and/or leaf litter (79% of observations). Climatic conditions at selected sites did not differ between males and females. Analysis of movements revealed an affinity for specific locations within their established activity ranges. Males and females did not differ with respect to their activity ranges or measured movement patterns (e.g., mean distance traveled/day, total distance moved, range length).																	1092-6194						2007	14	3					343	360		10.1656/1092-6194(2007)14[343:ARAHUO]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000249907200003

Prunus host range of Plum pox virus (PPV) in the United States by aphid and graft inoculation	PLANT DISEASE												Plum pox (Sharka) is a serious virus disease of stone fruits caused by the Plum pox virus (PPV). To determine which species could function as potential hosts and virus reservoirs, we used aphid transmission and bud or chip grafting to evaluate the susceptibility of commercial, ornamental, and wild Prunus species to isolates of PPV found in Pennsylvania, USA. Following inoculation, test trees were observed for symptoms, analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), back-assayed to healthy peach, and followed through at least four cold-induced dormancy (CID) cycles over 4 years. Thirty-one of 33 Prunus species and cultivars were systemically infected following aphid transmission. Systemic infection could not be detected in P. cerasus (sour cherry) and P. x 'Snofozam' (Snow Fountains) despite repeated aphid inoculation attempts. Following grafting of PPV-infected budwood, all 40 species and varieties became infected, although species differed in their susceptibility. Within most species, some individual plants remained PPV negative throughout the study despite repeated inoculations. Infection in some species could be detected only through quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. Most species displayed clear symptoms, were highly positive by ELISA and RT-PCR, and could be back-inoculated into peach seedlings following CID. Our results indicate that a wide range of native and ornamental Prunus species are susceptible to U.S. isolates of PPV-D.																	0191-2917					JAN	2007	91	1					18	23		10.1094/PD-91-0018								WOS:000243011800002

Global vegetation phenology from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS): Evaluation of global patterns and comparison with in situ measurements	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												In the last two decades the availability of global remote sensing data sets has provided a new means of studying global patterns and dynamics in vegetation. The vast majority of previous work in this domain has used data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer, which until recently was the primary source of global land remote sensing data. In recent years, however, a number of new remote sensing data sources have become available that have significantly improved the capability of remote sensing to monitor global ecosystem dynamics. In this paper, we describe recent results using data from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer to study global vegetation phenology. Using a novel new method based on fitting piecewise logistic models to time series data from MODIS, key transition dates in the annual cycle(s) of vegetation growth can be estimated in an ecologically realistic fashion. Using this method we have produced global maps of seven phenological metrics at 1- km spatial resolution for all ecosystems exhibiting identifiable annual phenologies. These metrics include the date of year for ( 1) the onset of greenness increase ( greenup), ( 2) the onset of greenness maximum ( maturity), ( 3) the onset of greenness decrease ( senescence), and ( 4) the onset of greenness minimum ( dormancy). The three remaining metrics are the growing season minimum, maximum, and summation of the enhanced vegetation index derived from MODIS. Comparison of vegetation phenology retrieved from MODIS with in situ measurements shows that these metrics provide realistic estimates of the four transition dates identified above. More generally, the spatial distribution of phenological metrics estimated from MODIS data is qualitatively realistic, and exhibits strong correspondence with temperature patterns in mid- and high-latitude climates, with rainfall seasonality in seasonally dry climates, and with cropping patterns in agricultural areas.

Contribution of winter processes to soil nitrogen flux in taiga forest ecosystems	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												We measured annual net nitrogen (N) mineralization, nitrification, and amino acid production in situ across a primary successional sequence in interior Alaska, USA. Net N mineralization per gram dry soil increased across the successional sequence, but with a sharp decline in the oldest stage (black spruce). Net N mineralization expressed per gram soil organic matter exhibited the opposite pattern, suggesting that soil organic matter quality decreases significantly across succession. Net N mineralization rates during the growing season from green-up (early May) through freeze-up (late September-early October) accounted for approximately 60% of the annual inorganic N flux, whereas the remaining N was released during the apparent dormant season. Nitrogen release during winter occurred primarily during October-January with only negligible N mineralization during early spring in stands of willow, alder, balsam poplar and white spruce. By contrast, black spruce stands exhibited substantial mineralization after snow melt during early spring. The high rates of N mineralization in late autumn through early winter coincide with high turnover of fine root biomass in these stands, suggesting that labile substrate production, rather than temperature, is a major controlling factor over N release in these ecosystems. We suggest that the convention of restricting measurements of soil processes to the growing season greatly underestimate annual flux rates of inorganic nitrogen in these high-latitude ecosystems.																	0168-2563					DEC	2006	81	3					349	360		10.1007/s10533-006-9045-3								WOS:000241747600006						
J	Shimizu, K; Fujisaki, K				Shimizu, Ken; Fujisaki, Kenji			Geographic variation in diapause induction under constant and changing conditions in Helicoverpa armigera	ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA												Variation in the incidence of diapause in local populations of Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) and Helicoverpa assulta (Guenee) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) was examined in relation to changes in photoperiod and/or temperature during the larval period. Temperate zone populations of H. assulta, a native species in temperate Japan, showed a high incidence of diapause induction when only the photoperiod was decreased during the larval period, even at favorable temperatures. This photoperiod-dependent response may allow H. assulta to foresee the beginning of autumn well in advance in the temperate zone, where temperature conditions are severe. In contrast, temperate zone populations of H. armigera, an invasive and polyphagous species mainly distributed in the subtropics, showed a high incidence of diapause only when both photoperiod and temperature decreased, whereas subtropical populations showed a very low incidence of diapause under the same conditions. Furthermore, both temperate zone and subtropical populations of H. armigera enter diapause under constant low temperatures at short-day photoperiod. Thus, there is geographic variation in sensitivity to diapause-inducing stimuli (changes in photoperiod and temperature) in H. armigera. This variation may be a part of the climatic adaptation achieved by H. armigera in Japan.																	0013-8703					DEC	2006	121	3					253	260		10.1111/j.1570-8703.2006.00483.x								WOS:000241954100008

Using behaviorally-based seasons to investigate canebrake rattlesnake (Crotalus horridus) movement patterns and habitat selection	HERPETOLOGICA												Both abiotic factors and behavioral patterns may influence snake activity. However, other than reproductive activities, behavioral patterns have rarely been incorporated into studies of snake habitat selection. We investigated seasonal differences in canebrake rattlesnake (Crotalus horridus) movement patterns and habitat selection. We modeled habitat selection in two ways, with and without regard to behaviorally-based seasons, and compared the two models to determine which yielded the most informative results. Behaviorally-based seasons (foraging, breeding, and hibernation) were determined from field observations of study animals. Habitat selection was modeled as habitat use versus availability using a case control sampling design for males and nongravid females using logistic regression. Males had significantly larger home ranges, moved more often, and traveled greater distances between successive locations during the breeding season as compared to nongravid females. The male no-season habitat model lacked significance, and the nongravid female no-season model revealed a positive association with pine savannas. When behaviorally-based seasons were included in the models, both sexes showed distinct seasonal variation in habitat selection, with males and nongravid females using similar habitat for breeding and hibernation, but partitioning habitat during the foraging season. Our results indicate that behaviorally-based seasons provide important details about intraspecific canebrake rattlesnake habitat selection and movement patterns, and that future research should benefit from the inclusion of snake behavior in habitat studies.																	0018-0831					DEC	2006	62	4					389	398		10.1655/0018-0831(2006)62[389:UBSTIC]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000243331800005

Habitat use and activity of Prairie Kingsnakes (Lampropeltis calligaster calligaster) in Illinois	JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY												The natural history of Prairie Kingsnakes (Lampropeltis calligaster calligaster) is largely unknown because of their secretive nature. We radio-tracked 10 adult Prairie Kingsnakes (six males, four females) for one complete active season to determine activity patterns and habitat use in an area in Illinois that included forest, grassland, agricultural fields, and roads. The active season extended from approximately April to mid-October. Home ranges of males averaged over four times larger than those of females and usually included the individual's hibernation site. Males and females had similar activity levels throughout the season, with no differences in frequency of movement or distance traveled per move. Snakes were underground at least 73% of the 574 times they were relocated, suggesting most activity is nocturnal. Collectively, kingsnakes completely avoided agricultural fields and showed a preference for grasslands, but females were strongly associated with grassland edges along roads. This association with roadside edges, and failure of Prairie Kingsnakes to cross roads, suggests that roads may be barriers to movement-an observation consistent with recent evidence that roads can be barriers to movement, negatively affecting snakes in ways other than via direct mortality.																	0022-1511					DEC	2006	40	4					423	428		10.1670/0022-1511(2006)40[423:HUAAOP]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000243034100002

JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY												Starting in 1999, repeated massive intrusions of the bug Arocatus melanocephalus inside urban buildings have been reported every summer in different locations in Northern Italy. This investigation, performed in the town of Modena, where the problem was particularly intense, by means of a survey and meteorological data series, showed a significant positive correlation between the intensity of insect outbreaks and the daily mean temperature increase. These findings suggest that current climatic warming might have affected the behaviour and/or population dynamics of A. melanocephalus and that building intrusions might represent an attempt to escape exceptionally high summer temperatures.

J	Medlock, JM; Avenell, D; Barrass, I; Leach, S				Medlock, Jolyon M.; Avenell, David; Barrass, Iain; Leach, Steve			Analysis of the potential for survival and seasonal activity of Aedes albopictus (Diptera : Culicidae) in the United Kingdom	JOURNAL OF VECTOR ECOLOGY												The international trade in used tires, coupled with the ability to lay non-desiccating eggs, has enabled Aedes albopictus (Skuse) (Diptera: Culicidae) to travel and establish on new continents, including North, Central, and South America, the Caribbean, Australasia, Africa, and Europe. Concerns have been raised over its potential role in the transmission of arboviruses and Dirofilaria nematodes. Following importation into northerly latitudes, photoperiodically-induced egg diapause enables establishment of Ae. albopictus, and a number of abiotic factors determine the subsequent seasonal activity. The United Kingdom (U.K.) imports over 5 million used tires annually, and this seems the most likely route by which Ae. albopiclus would be imported. The anthropophilic and container-breeding nature of Ae. albopictus could cause an urban human biting nuisance and the potential for involvernent in (human and veterinary) disease transmission cycles needs to be assessed. This paper addresses the likelihood for importation of Ae. albopictus into the U.K. and assesses, using a Geographic Information Systems (GIS)-based model, the ability for Ae. albopictus to establish, and the likely seasonal activity. It also reviews its possible role as a potential disease vector in the U.K.. The model predicts that abiotic risk factors would permit establishment of Ae. olbopictus throughout large parts of lowland U.K., with at least four to five months of adult activity (May-September), being more prolonged in the urban centers around London and the southern coastal ports. Pre-emptive surveillance of possible imported Ae. albopictus, through a targeted approach, could prevent the establishment of this exotic mosquito and mitigate any subsequent human and animal health implications for the U.K., either now or in the future.subsequent human and animal health implications for the U.K., either now or in the future.																	1081-1710	1948-7134				DEC	2006	31	2					292	304		10.3376/1081-1710(2006)31[292:AOTPFS]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000243418000011	17249347					
J	Tatarenko, IV; Kondo, K				Tatarenko, Irina V.; Kondo, Katsuhiko			Population biology of Pogonia japonica in Russia and Japan	PLANT SPECIES BIOLOGY												Pogonia japonica (Orchidaceae) is a clonal plant forming numerous adventitious shoots on long perennial roots. Seeds remained dormant for 3 years or more and rarely germinated. Populations consisted of ramets of different ages. Each ramet was a partial shoot growing vertically and monopodially before changing to sympodial growth after the first flowering. Annual growth consisted of two internodes making it easy to determine the shoot age. Three to 12 ramets were connected by a common root system. This might provide rapid development of ramets. In favorable habitats, vigorous ramets started flowering in the second or third year, and flowering lasted for another 3-4 years. In unfavorable habitats, preflowering shoot development took 3-5 years, or it died before or just after the first flowering. Ramets remained alive but senescent for 1-2 years after the last flowering. Disconnection of 2-4-year-old shoots was a normal process of vegetative reproduction. Some isolated mature shoots stayed dormant for 1-2 years. Young shoots disconnected within the first year usually died. Vegetative mature shoots predominated in the Russian populations, whereas young ramets were more numerous in the Japanese populations. The proportion of flowering to vegetative shoots averaged 15%, but reached as high as 55% in one Japanese population. Fruiting was high (80%) in Russian populations, but in some Japanese populations it dropped to zero after all fruits were damaged by insects. Differences in plant size and population structure reflected differences in ecological conditions more than geographic difference.																	0913-557X					DEC	2006	21	3					185	192		10.1111/j.1442-1984.2006.00164.x								WOS:000241500500007

High genetic diversity is generally considered to be advantageous in both processes. Combined with sex, it allows rapid evolution and adaptation to changing environments. We combined paleogenetic analysis with continent-wide survey of genetic diversity at nuclear and mitochondrial loci to reconstruct the invasion history of a single asexual American water flea clone (hybrid Daphnia pulex X Daphnia pulicaria) in Africa. Within 60 years of the original introduction of this invader, it displaced the genetically diverse, sexual population of native D. pulex in Lake Naivasha (Kenya), despite a formidable numerical advantage of the local population and continuous replenishment from a large dormant egg bank. Currently, the invading clone has spread throughout the range of native African D. pulex, where it appears to be the only occurring genotype. The absence of genetic variation did not hamper either the continent-wide establishment of this exotic lineage or the effective displacement of an indigenous and genetically diverse sibling species.

Survival of diapause larvae during winter as affected by low temperatures is a key factor determining the range of PBW Winter survival was estimated using data from Gutierrez et al. (Can. Entomol. 109 (1977) 1457) and Venette et al. (Environ. Entomol. 29 (5) (2000) 1018). The model was run continuously over the period 1 January 1995 to 31 December 2003 using observed weather data from 121 locations. Three output variables were mapped as measures of PBW persistence: over-winter survival of diapause PBW larvae, cumulative daily PBW larval densities over the season, and the number of diapause larvae produced during the season. The distribution of pink bollworm is predicted to be restricted to the relatively frost-free cotton growing areas of Arizona and Southern California where it currently reaches pest status. The model predicts that extension of PBW's range into the Central Valley of California is unlikely The analysis questions the efficacy of an ongoing area-wide effort to prevent the establishment of PBW in the Central Valley of California. Four global warming scenarios were examined to estimate the effects on the potential geographic range of PBW Average observed daily temperatures were increased 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 or 2.5 degrees C, respectively, in the four scenarios. Scenarios with average increases of 1.5-2.5 degrees C predicted that the range of PBW would expand into the Central Valley of California and the severity of the pest would greatly increase in areas of current infestation.

Habitat use of the endangered butterfly Euphydryas maturna and forestry in Central Europe	ANIMAL CONSERVATION												The knowledge of ecological requirements of declining butterflies of European woodlands remains limited, which hinders conservation management of their localities. This also applies for continentally threatened scarce fritillary Euphydryas maturna. On the basis of the largest data set on its habitat use ever collected in Central Europe, we analyse habitat requirements of its populations in Austria (A), the Czech Republic (Cz) and Germany (D). All studied populations inhabit open-canopy sites within woodlands, but larval survival decreases under full sun and preferred sites are relatively humid and sheltered. Nests of pre-hibernation larvae occur at terminal branches of Fraxinus excelsior, 1.5-3 m above the ground. Pre-hibernation mortality reaches 70% (Cz, D). Another limiting factor is quality of woodland vegetation: post-hibernation larvae consume a wide range of herbs and shrubs, and adult distribution is linked to nectar availability. The butterfly thus depends on highly heterogeneous early successional stages of deciduous woods, historically maintained by coppicing (Cz, D) and forest pasture (A). Restoration of these traditional methods offers the only chance for survival of E. maturna in Central Europe, and the butterfly may become a flagship for other threatened organisms of open-canopy woodlands.																	1367-9430					NOV	2006	9	4					388	397		10.1111/j.1469-1795.2006.00045.x								WOS:000241386700008

On the other hand, such an outbreak of A. solani has never been observed in Hokkaido Prefecture. To estimate whether genotypic composition are implicated in the outbreaks on soybean, we examined the esterase patterns detected by electrophoresis of 284 clones collected in these three prefectures and five other prefectures. We also examined the susceptibility to insecticides and life-cycle category of some of them. The esterase phenotypic composition was different between Hokkaido and Miyagi/Yamagata. This was especially so in the phenotypes at the presumed esterase locus 2. In Miyagi and Yarnagata the phenotypes with band F and activity (+ +) were frequently found, but the phenotypes with activity (+/-) and (-) were not found. In Hokkaido the phenotypes with activity (+/-) and (-) were frequently found, but the phenotypes with band F and activity (+ +) were not found. Any of the esterase alleles at this locus were not associated with resistance to acephate or fenvalerate. Populations in Hokkaido and northern Honshu were holocyclic and consisted of various esterase forms. These results were discussed in relation to the outbreaks on soybean.																	0003-6862	1347-605X				NOV	2006	41	4					595	605		10.1303/aez.2006.595								WOS:000243709100009						
J	Valimaki, P; Kaitala, A; Kokko, H				Valimaki, Panu; Kaitala, Arja; Kokko, Hanna			Temporal patterns in reproduction may explain variationin mating frequencies in the green-veined white butterfly Pieris napi	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY												There is genetic variation in the female mating rate in the green-veined white butterfly (Pieris napi), and females benefit from male ejaculates that contain both sperm and accessory gland substances. Although polyandry corresponds to higher lifetime fecundity than monandry, some females abstain from remating irrespective of the number of available mates. Explaining genetic variation in mating rates requires that monandrous females perform better than polyandrous ones under some conditions. We experimentally explored the reproductive performance of females either with a low or high intrinsic mating rate by allowing them to mate, feed, and lay eggs freely in a laboratory. Individual females followed different life histories: during the early days of reproduction, females with a low mating rate produced more eggs than females with a high mating rate. Hence, refraining from the benefits of multiple mating may be beneficial, if the time for reproduction is limited, or other female traits associated with polyandry are traded off against longevity. Given the day length of 10 h, a model shows that even if polyandrous females enjoy higher lifetime reproductive success, changeable and unpredictable weather will favor monandry if each period of suitable weather lasts, on average, less than 5 days. Thus, a combination of life history cost and unpredictability of fitness may explain the maintenance of monandry in the wild. Our results are also consistent with the observation that frequency of monandry increases with latitude.

Genetic analysis of the cultivated potato Solanum tuberosum L. Phureja Group using RAPDs and nuclear SSRs	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS												The Solanum tuberosum L. Phureja Group consists of potato landraces widely grown in the Andes from western Venezuela to central Bolivia, and forms an important breeding stock due to their excellent culinary properties and other traits for developing modern varieties. They have been distinguished by short-day adaptation, diploid ploidy (2n = 2x = 24), and lack of tuber dormancy. This nuclear simple sequence repeat (nSSR or microsatellite) study complements a prior random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) study to explore the use of these markers to form a core collection of cultivar groups of potatoes. Like this prior RAPD study, we analyzed 128 accessions of the Phureja Group using nuclear microsatellites (nSSR). Twenty-six of the 128 accessions were invariant for 22 nSSR markers assayed. The nSSR data uncovered 25 unexpected triploid and tetraploid accessions. Chromosome counts of the 102 accessions confirmed these nSSR results and highlighted seven more triploids or tetraploids. Thus, these nSSR markers (except 1) are good indicators of ploidy for diploid potatoes in 92% of the cases. The nSSR and RAPD results: (1) were highly discordant for the remaining 70 accessions that were diploid and variable in nSSR, (2) show the utility of nSSRs to effectively uncover many ploidy variants in cultivated potato, (3) support the use of a cultivar-group (rather than a species) classification of cultivated potato, (4) fail to support a relationship between genetic distance and geographic distance, (5) question the use of any single type of molecular marker to construct core collections.

Long-term population monitoring: Lessons learned from an endangered passerine in Hawai'i	WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN												Obtaining reliable population estimates is crucial to monitoring endangered species and developing recovery strategies. The palila (Loxioides bailleui) is an endangered seed-eating Hawaiian honeycreeper restricted to the subalpine forests of Mauna Kea, a volcano on the island of Hawaii, USA. The species is vulnerable to extinction primarily because > 90% of the population is concentrated in < 30 km(2) of habitat on the western slope of this high, dormant volcano. Annual surveys of the palila population have been conducted for ecological, legal, and other purposes since 1980. Because refinements to sampling protocols and analytical methods have evolved, we examined means of adapting the monitoring program to produce comparable estimates of abundance over the past 25-year period and into the future. We conducted variable circular plot surveys during the nonbreeding season (Jan-Mar) and this used data to obtain estimates of effective detection radius and annual density with Distance 4.0, Release 2. For comparability over the time-series, we excluded from analysis the data from new transects. We partitioned the 25-year data set (1980-1996 and 1997-2004) into 2 separate analyses because, beginning in 1997, observers received more training to reduce their tendency to estimate distances to 5-m intervals. We used geographic strata in the analysis of recent surveys because changes in habitat may have invalidated the density-based strata used previously. By adding observer and year and observer and time of day as co-variables, we improved the model fit to the 2 data sets, respectively. Annual estimates were confounded by changes in sampling methodology and analytical procedures over time. However, the addition of new transects, increased training for observers, and use of exact distance estimates instead of rounding also improved model fit. Habitat characteristics and behavior of palila that potentially influenced detection probability, sampling, analysis, and interpretation were regeneration of trees in response to reduced numbers of introduced browsing mammals, seasonally variable rates of vocalization, non-territoriality, and resource-tracking along an elevation gradient. We believe our adaptive approach to analysis and interpretation of 25 years of annual variable circular plot data could help guide similar long-term monitoring efforts.

J	Smith, CR; Tschinkel, WR				Smith, C. R.; Tschinkel, W. R.			The sociometry and sociogenesis of reproduction in the Florida harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex badius	JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE												The colony is the functional unit of natural selection for most social insects including the Florida harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex badius. To address reproduction in the species variables were evaluated relevant to the colony-level (sociometry), and social growth ( sociogenesis). Colonies become reproductively mature when the worker population reaches similar to 700 individuals. The production of males and gynes ( reproductive females) occurs only in spring, and is highly synchronized from its onset, which in turn allows synchronization of mating in early summer. Worker production follows sexual production, and continues until colonies go dormant in winter. Once mature, colony investment into reproduction is a constant proportion of colony size ( isometric), regardless of the sex ratio produced. As individual male body size increases, they become leaner, whereas the amount of fat stored by gynes is highly variable. Larger colonies produce larger males, but gyne size is a constant across the range of colony sizes. As colony size increases, investment into males increases faster than investment into gynes. Therefore, there is a trend of increasing male bias in the sex ratio with increasing colony size ( although a single outlier complicates this conclusion). We interpret our results in the light of sexual and natural selection as documented in related species. We also report the first documentation of male production by workers in the genus Pogonomyrmex.																	1536-2442					OCT 23	2006	6								32									WOS:000243273500002	19537980					
J	Flisak, Z; Ziegler, T				Flisak, Zygmunt; Ziegler, Tom			"Dormant" secondary metal-alkyl complexes are not omnipresent	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												This theoretical study was inspired by the perpetual debate over the so-called "dormancy" of the active sites in propylene polymerization, i.e., a drop in their activity after a regioerror (2,1-insertion), which was reported to occur in many (although not all) catalytic systems. To explore the range of possible situations, we have selected two homogeneous systems of fundamentally different structure: an octahedral system Of C-2 symmetry with a tetradentate -O-N-N-O- ligand and a bridged indenyl catalyst. This choice was not accidental; it is in these two systems where the experimentalists cannot reach a consensus about dormancy. Our density-functional theory calculations explain why in certain catalytic systems both primary and secondary alkyl complexes can be equally reactive toward propylene polymerization, despite the intuitive concept of dormancy. To understand such a behavior, it was imperative to build an extensive model, including the counteranion and solvent effects. The discussion is also supplemented by our latest calculations on the classical second-generation Ziegler-Natta system.
