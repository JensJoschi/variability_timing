J	CUNNINGHAM, EM; GUIRY, MD; BREEMAN, AM				CUNNINGHAM, EM; GUIRY, MD; BREEMAN, AM			ENVIRONMENTAL-REGULATION OF DEVELOPMENT, LIFE-HISTORY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY OF HELMINTHORA-STACKHOUSEI (RHODOPHYTA) BY DAYLENGTH AND TEMPERATURE	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												The marine red alga Helminthora stackhousei (Clemente) Cremades et Perez-Cirera [ = H. divaricata (C. Agardh) J. Agardh] from the west coast of Ireland has a heteromorphic life history in culture. Tetrasporangia are formed on uniseriate, filamentous tetrasporophytes, mainly under short-day conditions, at (7-)9-17-degrees-C. Although photoperiodic induction occurs, night-breaks of 1 h in the middle of a 16-h night are ineffective in suppressing this response. Tetraspores form further uniseriate filaments which produce multiaxial gametophytic thalli, mainly under long-day conditions at (7-)9-17-degrees-C. The critical daylength is not constant over this temperature range. Night-breaks promote the initiation of multiaxial thalli, and nine photoinductive long-day cycles induce a 50% response. At 16-degrees-C, equivalent photon exposures at two irradiance levels promote development of multiaxial thalli in long-day regimes but continue to inhibit induction in short days. Tetrasporophytes and uniseriate gametophytes reproduce asexually by fragmentation and monospores under all conditions. Multiaxial gametophytic thalli form monosporangia, gametangia, and develop carposporophytes regardless of photoperiod. Photoperiod and temperature as factors controlling the developmental life history sequence are used to formulate models to explain the phenology of H. stackhousei. These factors are also considered in relation to the biogeography of the species in the eastern North Atlantic and Mediterranean.																	0022-0981						1993	171	1					1	21		10.1016/0022-0981(93)90136-C								WOS:A1993LX81700002

More females than males were present during the breeding season. Field-collected animals become progressively easier to bring into breeding condition with subsequent month of collection after the end of the natural breeding season. A recuperative phase at the end of the natural breeding season exists, but its duration can be reduced by increasing the ambient temperature to which animals are exposed. Neither initiation of reproduction or female fecundity is effected by day length (L:D 14:10 same as D:D). There was no consistent effect of salinity on either initiation of breeding or female fecundity, although the rate of development of the embryos may have been slower at the highest salinity (100 % seawater). The important environmental factor in the control of reproduction in 0. gammarellus is temperature. Higher temperatures initiate reproduction more rapidly (within the range 15-22-degrees-C). The onset of breeding in the field occurs when the maximum air temperature reaches 10-degrees-C. The role of temperature in regulating reproduction is discussed in relation to the breeding of other amphipod species and the possibility of temperature effects on the field sex ratio is considered.																	0022-0981						1993	165	2					191	208		10.1016/0022-0981(93)90105-W								WOS:A1993KH75900005

The isolation of PRL-like ir-material was accomplished using a 0.25 M ammonium sulphate (pH 5.5) extraction followed by ethanol precipitation, whereas the resulting 2.0 M ammonium sulphate (pH 7.0) precipitate contained a GH-like immunoreactivity. Gel chromatography of the GH-like immunoreactivity (Sephadex G-100) indicated the presence of several GH-like fragments ranging in the M(r) range of 7,000 to 55,000. Analyses of the PRL-like ir-material found in pineal tissue on HPLC using a TSK 545-DEAE column led to the resolution into a single peak of immunoreactivity. A single peak of activity was also observed following chromatofocusing and hydrophobic interaction chromatography of the ir-peak from the TSK 545-DEAE column. The PRL-like ir-material inhibited the binding of [I-125]ovine PRL-S14 to anti-ovine PRL antibodies without showing an affinity for binding to anti-rat PRL or anti-bovine GH antibodies. Scatchard analysis of the binding of pineal PRL-like ir-material and pituitary ovine PRL-S14 to liver membranes from day-20 pregnant rats revealed similar affinity constants (K(a) of 4.7 +/- 0.2 x 10(9) M(-1)). In addition, the replication of Nb 2 Node rat lymphoma cells was stimulated by pineal PRL-like ir-material, an effect known to be specific for lactogenic hormones. The pineal PRL-like immunoreactivity appeared on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels as a single major band of M(r) 24,000. The functional status of PRL- and GH-like ir-material in the ovine pineal remains to be determined, but evidence is presented that the overall protein synthesis rate of the rat pineal responded to circulating concentrations of PRL.																	0742-3098					JAN	1993	14	1					11	22		10.1111/j.1600-079X.1993.tb00479.x								WOS:A1993KW38200002	7683336					
J	HONEK, A				HONEK, A			MELANISM IN THE LAND SNAIL HELICELLA-CANDICANS (GASTROPODA, HELICIDAE) AND ITS POSSIBLE ADAPTIVE SIGNIFICANCE	MALACOLOGIA												Shell banding polymorphism in 184 local populations of Helicella candicans (Pfeiffer) from western Czechoslovakia was investigated. The shells are white with up to nine dark brown bands, which may fuse. There was large within- and among-population variation in shell banding. An ''index of melanisation,'' indicating proportion of shell surface covered with extended or fused bands, revealed geographic patterning of dark phenotypes. The frequency of dark forms was higher in some areas, due perhaps to decrease of incident sunshine by fog, clouds or industrial air pollution. High and dense vegetation cover were also associated with melanism. In the laboratory, temperature of irradiated dark shells increased more rapidly than that of light shells, and the thermal equilibrium of the former was higher. The differences were greatest on a white background and with low ambient temperature. In areas of reduced sunshine, dark individuals may be at an advantage, especially during the autumn breeding period. When exposed to sunshine during summer dormancy, light forms may also be able to maintain lower body temperature than dark forms.																	0076-2997						1993	35	1					79	87										WOS:A1993LQ99700006

Observations of this population over the past ten years yielded similar results. Eighty percent of the pups were born by 2 October. Most (96%) of 663 females marked during three breeding seasons gave birth to a pup. Females stayed on land a mean of 28 d, gave birth 6 d after arrival, nursed their pups for 22 d, and copulated a mean of 2.5 times 20 d after parturition and 2 d before departure. Copulations peaked during the third week in October. Males spent 57-80 d on land fasting and defending harems of up to 134 females (median 11-13 females, depending on year). Most (96%) marked females that gave birth (n = 636) also weaned their pups successfully. Pup sex ratio was unity. Harems were smaller and breeding occurred about three weeks earlier in Patagonia than in other colonies. Thermal conditions, day length and food availability may explain clines in the timing of breeding events between populations. Other parameters of the breeding season for the expanding Patagonia colony are similar to those for declining southern elephant seal populations elsewhere.

J	BACK, S; COLLINS, JC; RUSSELL, G				BACK, S; COLLINS, JC; RUSSELL, G			COMPARATIVE REPRODUCTIVE-BIOLOGY OF THE GULF OF FINLAND AND THE IRISH SEA FUCUS-VESICULOSUS L	SARSIA												Variation in reproductive characters of two geographically distinct populations of Fucus vesiculosus L. (Phaeophyta, Fucales) from both open and sheltered shores of Baltic, the Gulf of Finland and Atlantic, the Irish Sea coast has been quantified. The period during which the population contains fertile plants is longer on Atlantic than on Baltic coasts, where all receptacles are shed by the end of July. There are differences in reproductive allocation, the value of Atlantic plants being double that of the Baltic population. The mean oogonial length is greater in the Atlantic populations and the size frequency is different, with Atlantic plants bearing some immature oogonia at peak fertility time. Baltic plants have oogonia of more uniform size. Receptacles of Baltic plants have a looser web-like organisation of hyphae in the medulla, which is also characterized by presence of enlarged air cavities formed by schizogeny. The hyphal cells are wider in Atlantic plants than in Baltic plants. Atlantic receptacles are greater in size, they contain more mucilage and lack air-spaces. Baltic Fucus, which is permanently submerged, has receptacles modified for buoyancy while those of intertidal Atlantic coasts have a structure more related to mechanical strength. The reproductive phenology of Baltic Fucus reflects the relatively short season when the growth is possible. Unlike floral structure, which is relatively conservative, fucoid reproductive characters are subject to considerable environmental modification.																	0036-4827						1993	78	3-4					265	272										WOS:A1993NB68800007

Bionomic data obtained from laboratory rearings between 1982-1987 showed that T. dubius eggs took about 7 days to hatch and that duration of the larval stage was about 42 days. Observations showed that T. dubius had a prolonged prepupal stage (xBAR = 56.4 days, range 14-274 days), which was probably non-diapausal in nature. Mean adult longevity was 50 days (range 1-358 days). Temnochila virescens eggs took almost 9 days to hatch, and a lengthy larval stage (xBAR = 155.4 days, range 73-333 days) was observed. Mean duration of the pupal stage was 14 days (range 7-28 days). A long preoviposition period (xBAR = 141 days, range 47-206 days) was observed, and adults were very long-lived (xBAR = 232.7 days, range 14-667 days). Capacity for increase (r(c)) calculated from rearing data suggested that numbers of T. dubius could be increased faster than T. virescens. Mortality between 1982-1987 averaged about 70% for both species. However, mortality of T. dubius in 1987 increased significantly, suggesting that inbreeding or other methodological factors could be responsible. A mass-rearing method using Ips-infested pine billets was developed as a cheaper alternative to laboratory rearing, and was shown to be effective in producing large numbers of insects for release.

J	TAUBER, CA; TAUBER, MJ				TAUBER, CA; TAUBER, MJ			PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY IN CHRYSOPERLA - GENETIC-VARIATION IN THE SENSORY MECHANISM AND IN CORRELATED REPRODUCTIVE TRAITS	EVOLUTION												A genetically variable sensory mechanism provides phenotypic plasticity in the seasonal cycle of the Chrysoperla carnea species-complex of green lacewings. The mechanism functions as a switch during the pupal and early imaginal stages to determine aestival reproduction versus aestival dormancy, and it has two major components: (1) response to photoperiod and (2) response to a stimulus(i) associated with the prey of the larvae. Ultimately, the switch is based on the response to photoperiod - an all-or-nothing trait whose variation (long-day reproduction versus a short-day/long-day requirement for reproduction) is determined by alleles at two unlinked autosomal loci. In eastern North America, variation in this component of the switch differentiates two reproductively isolated ''species'' that are sympatric throughout the region: Chrysoperla carnea, in which both loci are homozygous for the dominant alleles that determine long-day, spring and summer reproduction and thus multivoltinism, and C. downesi, which has a very high incidence of the recessive alleles for the short-day/long-day requirement, and thus univoltine spring In contrast, geographical populations in western North America harbor variable amounts of within- and among-family genetic variation for the photoperiodic responses and also for the switch's second component-adult responsiveness to the prey of the larvae. The geographic pattern of genetic variation in the two components of the switch indicates that it is a highly integrated adaptation to environmental heterogeneity. Expression of among-family variation in the prey component of the switch is highly dependent on photoperiodic conditions and genotype (it requires a constant long daylength and the recessive short-day/long-day genotype). Thus, we infer that responsiveness to prey evolved as a modifier of the photoperiodic trait. The switch has a significant negative effect on a major determinant of fitness; it lengthens the preoviposition period in nondiapausing reproductives. This negative effect may result in temporal variation in the direction of selection, which helps maintain genetic variability in the switch mechanisms of western populations. Also, the photoperiodic and prey components of the switch are positively correlated with fecundity in nondiapausing reproductives; however, the strong influence of environmental factors-presence or absence of prey-leaves open the question whether the correlated effects on fecundity are expressed in nature.																	0014-3820					DEC	1992	46	6					1754	1773		10.2307/2410029								WOS:A1992KG89700011	28567748

The diapausing strain showed negligible digestive amylase activity at a pH range of 3-11, while the nondiapausing strain registered strikingly higher amylase activity at pH 9.2. Higher levels of undigested starch was found in the faecal matter of the diapausing strain, which is consistent with the negligible digestive amylase activity. Developmental specific expression of haemolymph amylase activity was seen in nondiapausing and diapausing strains. In the nondiapausing strain the digestive amylase activity was at its peak during intemoult and depressed during moult. PAGE analysis revealed the occurrence of only anodal digestive and haemolymph amylases in the diapausing strain, whereas both cathodal and anodal enzymes were seen in the digestive fluid and haemolymph of the nondiapausing strain.																	0965-1748					DEC	1992	22	8					867	873		10.1016/0965-1748(92)90113-S								WOS:A1992KC89800010

Two types of responses occur: (1) in reptant decapods, short photoperiods and low temperatures are necessary to induce vitellogenesis; (2) in natant decapods and in most peracarids, both high temperatures and long photoperiods promote the onset of reproduction. In this context studies on the biological clocks involved in photoperiodic time measurement were performed on two crustaceans: the ditch shrimp Palaemonetes varians and the woodlouse Armadillidium vulgare, which is distributed worldwide outside polar and intertropical areas. The most important feature of the photoperiodic response curves was the same mean lag time in response to photophase length less-than-or-equal-to 12 h: short photophases delayed breeding but did not prevent it (i. e., '' short-day effect''). On the contrary, long photophases promoted the onset of reproduction (i.e., 'long-day effect'') differently in P. varians and A. vulgare. In A. vulgare strains the shape of the photoperiodic response curve depended on latitudinal origin. Results of ''resonance'' experiments provided evidence of involvement of an endogenous circadian component in the photoperiodic clocks of the two species according to the internal coincidence model developed for insects. Seeing that relations between reproduction and moulting were different in the two species, we proposed the hypothesis of an evolutionary change in the transition from the sea to the continental environment.

The effect of a slight rise in temperature is discussed as far as aquatic organisms are concerned. The effect is likely to be most marked on pelagic populations of marine organisms such as squid and also on intertidal animals. A rise in mean sea level is an indirect result of global warming, and this is likely to have an effect on estuarine organisms and mud flat dwellers. It is suggested that those organisms which are close to the southern limits of their distribution in Ireland may disappear from our fauna. Examples are given from earlier periods and from the present-day fauna. There is likely to be an expansion of the distribution of southern forms which at the moment are near the northern limit of their range. As far as terrestrial animals are concerned, the problem of whether the rainfall pattern will also change is discussed. The likely effects of this on parasite and free-living populations (including the fauna of temporary water bodies, common in West Ireland) are discussed. The complications introduced by diapause and related factors are considered. The fauna of peat bogs may be seriously affected and also those organisms dependent on certain food plants. The peculiar problems of Ireland in having so many empty niches is considered in relation to the increased dangers of accidental introductions.																	0168-8170					DEC	1992	22	1-3					239	244		10.1080/07924259.1992.9672276								WOS:A1992LK66800029

However, changes in temperature and photoperiod may disturb the life cycles of some existing polar invertebrates while continuing to constrain the polewards migration of more temperate species. Higher plants are likely to have higher productivity as temperatures and atmospheric CO2 levels increase but this productivity will be reduced by exposure to increasing UV-B radiation. Higher plants migrate more slowly than the rate at which climate is predicted to change and many species will be trapped in supra-optimal climates. Both mosses and lichens can migrate faster than higher plants, propagules of non-polar species already reaching the Antarctic, but they have fewer mechanisms of responding to changing environments. Polar vegetation and ecosystems provide feedback to the climate system: positive feedbacks are associated with decreases in reflectivity and increased carbon emissions from warming soils. In the Antarctic, feedback and responses to environmental change will be smaller than in the Arctic because of the less responsive cryptogams which dominate the Antarctic, the paucity of Antarctic soils, and geographical barriers to plant and invertebrate migrations.

Migration was associated with life-history events and may have occurred in response to spatial and temporal variations in environmental conditions and resources. All crabs displayed distinct shifts in depth and habitat use and followed a general pattern of seasonal movement as follows: (1) gradual movement to deep water in spring after mating and egg extrusion, and residence there through early November; (2) abrupt, synchronous movement into shallow-water areas in November, and residence there, through late February or early March; and (3) gradual, synchronous movement to intermediate depths followed by movement into shallow water to molt and mate between late March and late May. The behavior of primiparous crabs was more variable than that of multiparous crabs. The differences in behavior may result from ontogenetic shifts in movements, and habitat selection. The annual range of primiparous crabs (xBAR = 11.9 km2) exceeded that of multiparous crabs (xBAR = 3.6 km2). Mean depth was directly correlated with photoperiod, and the sudden, synchronous movement of crabs between habitats coincided with thermohaline mixing. Females displayed a highly aggregated distribution, especially during winter in shallow water, where podding behavior of adult crabs was documented for the first time.																	0278-0372					NOV	1992	12	4					546	560		10.2307/1548836								WOS:A1992JX85500003

The obliquebanded leafroller is native to the study area and apple was introduced in the valley at the beginning of the century. Components of insect fitness were measured to help formulate predictions about the evolution of host preference in this generalist herbivore. In the summer, females attained a higher pupal weight on apple than on trembling aspen, wild rose and snowberry. Males performed best on apple and trembling aspen. In the field, females arising from caterpillars fed on apple leaves had a 26% greater mean fecundity than if fed on alternative hosts. The diet also affected development time; females initiated pupation later on trembling aspen than on the other hosts. Finally, no differences were found in larval survival nor in the proportion of larvae diapausing when fed on different hosts. These components of fitness indicate apple as the most suitable host in the summer. In the fall, diet influenced larval propensity to initiate diapause in the second or third instar, the time elapsed from hatching to diapause initiation and the weight of the instars initiating diapause. However, no difference in overwintering survival among larvae fed on different hosts was detected. The rank order of water and nitrogen contents of leaves of the host plants did not match the rank order of larval feeding performance in either season. A high suitability of apple and its abundance in the Okanagan valley are factors that would favor the evolution of an increased utilization of this host by the obliquebanded leafroller.																	0013-8703					OCT	1992	65	1					1	10		10.1111/j.1570-7458.1992.tb01621.x								WOS:A1992JV40900001

For each buffer system, eight pH levels were tested ranging from 4 to 11. GLYC at pH 7-9 supported the highest germination percentages compared with the other combinations tested. In general, highest germination levels for all buffer systems occurred in the pH range of 6-8, although they were skewed toward the basic side of the pH scale in OPHO, THMM, and GLYC for isolate RF 150. THMM supported germination better than any other buffer system under highly alkaline conditions. Soil pH may be an important factor in disease transmission under natural conditions. The combined effects of temperature, photoperiod, pH, and buffer medium should be considered when reporting and comparing spore germination levels.																	0046-225X					OCT	1992	21	5					1202	1211		10.1093/ee/21.5.1202								WOS:A1992JU15400038						
J	ANTOLIN, MF				ANTOLIN, MF			SEX-RATIO VARIATION IN A PARASITIC WASP .1. REACTION NORMS	EVOLUTION												To understand genetic and phenotypic constraints on the sex ratio in a parasitic wasp that attacks fly pupae, I carried out a laboratory study of sex ratio variability in five strains of Muscidifurax raptor (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae). I manipulated the environment through combinations of temperature and day length, and the numbers of females that attack a group of hosts. The change of phenotype in each strain over the range of environmental conditions describes the norm of each reaction for that strain, and measures how a strain responds to environmental variation to create phenotypic variability. Sex ratio in parasitic wasps is a complex trait that has several components-the numbers of eggs laid by an ovipositing wasp and the fraction of eggs that are fertilized (female). Further, sex ratio may be influenced by a female's reaction to other females exploiting the same hosts (superparasitism). I found no strain-environment interactions in either sex ratio or fecundity when I varied environmental conditions. Although strains differed in sex ratio and fecundity, all strains produced a more female-biased sex ratio and had higher fecundity when temperature and day length increased. Sex ratio and fecundity were phenotypically correlated, and strains with greater fecundity also produced a more female-biased sex ratio. All strains facultatively shifted sex ratio toward a higher fraction of males with increasing female density, despite apparent differences in superparasitism among strains. Males and females survived equally during development, so that mortality differences among strains and across environments could not account for sex ratio variability. This study indicates that sex ratio variability among strains is constrained by the correlation between sex ratio and fecundity, and that strains display similar facultative shifts in sex ratio as female density increases because sex ratio shifts are insensitive to differing levels of superparasitism.																	0014-3820	1558-5646				OCT	1992	46	5					1496	1510		10.2307/2409953								WOS:A1992JV37100019	28568978

Shallow groundwater samples were collected from springs and analyzed. After the 5-yr prestudy period, NO3-N levels in the groundwater from the three watersheds were in a 3 to 5 mg/L range. Groundwater NO3-N concentrations increased slightly during the first 3 yr at the higher N fertilizer rate, though they remained in the 3 to 5 mg(L range. Nitrate-N levels increased more sharply during the rest of the study. Although these NO3-N levels varied more between the growing and dormant seasons than when lower rates of fertilizer were applied, they eventually reached a slower rate of increase. During the 9th and 10th yr of the high application, seasonal NO3-N levels in groundwater ranged from 10 to 16 and 7 to 14 mg(L from the watersheds receiving NH4NO3 and methylene urea, respectively. This study showed that 168 kg N/ha was too much for this system, regardless of whether conventional or slow-release N was used.																	0047-2425					OCT-DEC	1992	21	4					607	613		10.2134/jeq1992.00472425002100040014x								WOS:A1992JZ31600014

The strains represented the following types of diapause: larval obligatory, larval photoperiodic (critical daylengths from 14 h in the south to 21 h in the north), and no photoperiodic diapause. The eclosion rhythmicity of all strains was weak in all diel photoperiods. The free-running rhythms of eclosion were also of low amplitude. Three other species of Chymomyza were studied for comparison: Chymomyza distincta and C. fuscimana with a larval diapause and C. caudatula with an adult diapause. Only C. caudatula had the rhythmic eclosion that drosophilids have in general. We conclude that the exceptionally weak eclosion rhythmicity in C. costata is an adaptation for eclosion at any permissive time of day around midsummer. The weak rhythmicity of eclosion in C. costata would thus be phenotypic plasticity, an adaptation to the exceptional phenological timing of the species. There was no parallel variation between circadian eclosion rhythms and photoperiodism.																	0022-1910					OCT	1992	38	10					803	811		10.1016/0022-1910(92)90033-A								WOS:A1992JT79000010						
J	ROGOWITZ, GL				ROGOWITZ, GL			REPRODUCTION OF WHITE-TAILED JACKRABBITS ON SEMIARID RANGE	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Reproduction in lagomorphs may be sensitive to adverse winter conditions or summer drought. Consequently, I studied white-tailed jackrabbits (Lepus townsendii) in Wyoming, from 1985 to 1987, to evaluate their reproductive pattern and fertility on semi-arid range. The breeding season of white-tailed jackrabbits began between late February and mid-March and ended in July. Breeding began later in 1986 and 1987 (2 yr with sparse snow cover) than in 1985 (when greater late-winter snow accumulation occurred). I detected no effect of ambient temperature on the onset of breeding. Reproductively active females conceived in approximate synchrony, and litters were produced during 3 distinct periods each year. In the first 2 litter periods, all adult females were pregnant, and they shed a mean of 7 ova/litter. Prenatal mortality during late winter (xBAR = 36% loss/litter, 1985-87) reduced the mean size of first litters to 4 viable fetuses. In the second litter period, when vegetation was no longer dormant, less prenatal mortality occurred (xBAR = 7% loss/litter, 1985-86) and the mean litter size increased to 6. Reproductive output subsequently declined in the third litter period, which occurred during late-summer drought. Low ova production (xBAR = 5/litter, 1985-86) and high prenatal mortality during the third litter period (max. = 86% loss/litter) reduced the mean litter size to 4. White-tailed jackrabbits may respond to environmental changes by shifting their breeding onset and varying their reproductive output. Their reproduction increased when environmental conditions seemed improved, as shown by their earlier breeding onset in 2 years with reduced snow cover and greater fetal production in the middle than at the extremes of the breeding season.																	0022-541X					OCT	1992	56	4					676	684		10.2307/3809460								WOS:A1992JU69400008						
J	WAITE, TA				WAITE, TA			WINTER FATTENING IN GRAY JAYS - SEASONAL, DIURNAL AND CLIMATIC CORRELATES	ORNIS SCANDINAVICA												Recent models of body mass regulation predict that small birds wintering under thermally stressful conditions should show increases in the dawn minima of their body mass and fat reserves with the approach of midwinter. This seasonal increase in energy reserves is hypothesized to function as insurance against the increased thermal demands during the short cold days of midwinter, when snowstorms can further reduce the already-deteriorating food supply. Superimposed on this winter fattening strategy, there should be a daily increase in the amount of fat stored for the coming night of fasting. To investigate patterns of variation in their body mass and fat reserves, Gray Jays Perisoreus canadensis were captured repeatedly near the northern limit of their range in Alaska between 7 September and 16 December 1987. As predicted, the dawn minima of body mass and fat stores tended to increase with the approach of mid-winter. In addition, the results suggest that the jays increased their energy reserves later in the day, and that they facultatively increased their reserves in response to lower temperatures, heavier snowfall, and windier conditions. These results indicate that there was a seasonal increase in energy reserves associated with decreasing photoperiod, and that superimposed on this pattern was a daily cycle sensitive to contemporaneous climatic conditions. Thus, the jays appeared to have increased fasting capacity during those times when the risk of energetic shortfall was heightened.																	0030-5693					OCT-DEC	1992	23	4					499	503		10.2307/3676682								WOS:A1992KA56200010

Interacting effects of photophase and scotophase were examined by exposing larvae to non-24-h cycles in which the two component phases were varied independently of each other. With a photophase of 1-3 h, winter diapause was most effectively prevented by a light pulse at a fixed time (I 2 h) from lights-on rather than lights-off. With photophases of 4-36 h, the diapause programming was basically dependent on the scotophase length, but the critical scotophase increased as the photophase deviated from 12 h. The quantitative variation in the diapause-inducing effect of scotophases within the inductive range could interact with the available number of cycles restricted by the cycle length, and this might cause apparent shift of the "critical" scotophase. The response to interruption of 12-h scotophase was also affected by photophase length, and the effect of 1 h light pulse was more changeable in the early than in the late scotophase.																	0022-1910	1879-1611				SEP	1992	38	9					681	686		10.1016/0022-1910(92)90050-N								WOS:A1992JK82000006

Adults are in reproductive diapause during the dry season. In conditions of 40:25-degrees-C or 35:25-degrees-C, diapause is induced when larvae develop in thermophases longer than 14 h, in thermophases shorter than 10 h and in continuous darkness. Thermophases of 12 h cause a reduction of the proportion of diapausing beetles. This proportion also depends on the thermoperiod temperatures. Development at low temperatures (23:16-degrees-C, 12:12 h) induces a high percentage of diapausing beetles. However, at low temperatures, the developmental times of the beetles are long and show important interindividual variability. When larvae develop in decreasing temperatures, small changes in thermoperiod temperatures (35:25-degrees-C to 30:20-degrees-C) have a strong effect on diapause induction. When larvae develop at low temperatures (25:15-degrees-C) and then at high temperatures (40:25-degrees-C), the proportion of diapausing beetles depends on the duration of development at low temperatures. Whatever the developmental conditions, both sexually active and diapausing beetles always emerge from the seeds. This interindividual variability is important in this species which has a wide geographical distribution in Africa.																	0307-6962					SEP	1992	17	3					247	254		10.1111/j.1365-3032.1992.tb01018.x								WOS:A1992JH95500008

These traits then form genetically coordinated syndrome of traits that reinforce each other in a continuum from diapause-prone to diapause-resistant genotypes. We propose that this syndrome maintains genetic flexibility in a habitat that imposes fluctuating stabilizing selection on diapause.																	0013-8746					JUL	1992	85	4					445	451		10.1093/aesa/85.4.445								WOS:A1992JD98100010

Mean conception dates for 25 groups of Japanese macaques species did not correlate with latitude. Instead, they were positively related to mean fall and winter temperatures and negatively related to the magnitude of the decrease in the mean temperature from summer to fall. Evidence from transplanted groups supports the hypothesis that environmental temperature is a decisive factor in determining the timing of mating activities of Japanese macaques. These results are also consistent with the concept that, in temperate zones, environmental temperature is probably the best indicator of local climatic characteristics.

Wide varietal variation was observed in each character. Nearly half of the variation for each character was explained by a geographical difference in origin. Based on these data and the growing environments in each locality, we analyzed "adaptation strategy", seen as the adjustment of heading time in terms of differences in the constituent traits, both individually and combined. The difference among localities indicated that wheat landraces had been selected for early heading as an adaptation strategy to water stress and/or high temperature in early summer. This change was caused by a reduction in photoperiodic response and narrow-sense earliness. The vernalization requirement was also reduced for adaptation to relatively mild winters. Adaptation strategy deduced from the variation within each locality was also different amongst localities. In the central region of wheat evolution, where wide variations existed in both photoperiodic response and narrow-sense earliness, the late-heading trait was achieved by either one of these traits individually or both of them combined. On the contrary, in the eastern and the western regions, wide variation in heading time was achieved by the unique combination of photoperiodic response and narrow-sense earliness. A sampling strategy for wheat germ plasm is also discussed.																	0040-5752					JUL	1992	84	3-4					259	265										WOS:A1992JG24700001	24203181

A minimum incubation time of 16+/-SE 0.97 d was recorded in summer and this progressively increased through autumn as temperatures declined. Eggs laid in autumn overwintered for 140+/-2.63 d until spring, when rising temperatures initiated hatching. Controlled laboratory studies established that the threshold for egg development was in the region of 15.6-degrees-C and that eggs required 5268 degree-hours to complete their development. Analysis of hourly soil temperature records, measured at egg pod depth in the field, showed that temperatures first dropped below this critical temperature threshold during mid-April, after which eggs became quiescent and overwintered until spring. There was no evidence of diapause in the field and overwintering eggs exhibited a wide range of embryonic development. Quiescence during winter on the OFS highveld was therefore a simple temperature-induced response. This is the first record of prolonged overwintering in the egg stage of the migratory locust in Africa.																	0007-4853					JUN	1992	82	2					235	241		10.1017/S0007485300051786								WOS:A1992JC72300013

In the bivoltine strain, both the egg and larval stages were found to be sensitive to photoperiod. When the egg stage was exposed to a long-day photoperiod (16L:8D), larval development showed a short-day type response, and mature third-instar larvae entered a summer diapause under a long-day photoperiod (15L:9D). When eggs experienced short days, the first-instar larvae entered a winter diapause under short-day conditions, and the critical photoperiod in the larval stage ranged from about 14L:10D to about 12L:12D as the photoperiod experienced by the eggs increased from 12L:12D to 14L:10D. However, the development of the larvae after overwintering was not influenced by the photoperiod In the trivoltine strain, larval development was retarded under a 14L:1OD photoperiod but not under either shorter or longer photoperiods, when larvae had spent the egg stage under a 16L: 8D photoperiod. The critical photoperiod of the larval stage for the induction of a winter diapause in the first instar was about 12L:12D, though it varied to some extent with the photoperiod during the egg stage. Thus, Chlorops oryzae was able to adapt itself to the local climatic conditions by the development of variable and complicated photoperiodic responses.																	0013-8703					JUN	1992	63	3					273	281		10.1111/j.1570-7458.1992.tb01584.x								WOS:A1992JD11100010

Joint scaling tests were used to analyze means and variances of first- and second-generation hybrids in order to determine whether nonadditive genetic variance, especially epistatic variance, contributed to divergence in critical photoperiod. In both crosses, digenic epistatic effects were highly significant, indicating that genetic divergence cannot have resulted solely from differences in additively acting loci. For one cross that could be tested directly for such effects, higher order epistasis and/or linkage did not contribute to the divergence of critical photoperiod between the constituent populations.

The SIL population is located near the northern range limit of H. limbata, and some important differences in hatching dynamics were seen in comparison with southern populations. Hatching success and egg development time were related to temperature, as reported in the south, but the developmental threshold temperature for the SIL population was near 8-degrees-C, 2-degrees tower than previously reported. Storage of the eggs at 8-degrees-C resulted in slow but measurable development rather than low-temperature quiescence as expected, leading to inconsistent degree-day estimation among temperature treatments. Following storage at 8-degrees-C, both egg development rate and hatching success increased with increasing temperature. However, hatching success was improved by increasing the time the eggs spent in storage, ranging from only 50% hatch in unstored eggs to > 90% hatch in eggs stored for approximately 6 mo. In addition, a bimodal hatching response was seen in the eggs; about half of the eggs deposited by individual females hatched immediately under favourable conditions, and the remainder hatched after exposure to cold (4-degrees-C). A lower developmental threshold than previously reported and a previously undescribed egg diapause may enable Hexagenia limbata to persist near the northern extent of its distribution.																	0887-3593					JUN	1992	11	2					194	203		10.2307/1467385								WOS:A1992HV97500006

In progressive chilling experiments (10 days acclimation at each 5-degrees step in the temperature range from 15 to -5-degrees-C), mean supercooling points (measured at a cooling rate of 0.1-degrees-C min-1) were lowered from -20.4-degrees-C at 15-degrees-C to -24.0-degrees-C at 5-degrees-C (lower lethal temperatures: c.-28-degrees-C) in O.nubilalis, compared with -15.0 to -17.2-degrees-C (lower lethal temperatures: -15 to -17-degrees-C respectively) in S.cretica. Concentrations of glycerol and trehalose determined by gas chromatography of whole body extracts were consistently higher in the former than in the latter species at both 15 and 5-degrees-C, and may be responsible for the deeper supercooling in O.nubilalis larvae. Acclimation to 5-degrees-C increased glycerol levels in O.nubilalis extracts compared with 15-degrees-C, and this was enhanced in larvae exposed for a further 10 days at each of 0 and -5-degrees-C (glycerol being 438-mu-mol ml-1 body water). Haemolymph glycerol concentrations showed a similar pattern to whole body extracts in this species. Fat body glycogen was reduced during low temperature acclimation in both species. Body water contents did not change with acclimation in O.nubilalis, whilst S.cretica, containing significantly more water, lost c.7% during acclimation from 15 to 5-degrees-C. Haemolymph osmolalities increased during acclimation, especially in Ostrinia larvae, probably as a result of the accumulation of cryoprotectants. The majority of O.nubilalis larvae survived freezing,under the conditions of the cooling experiments, whilst larvae of S.cretica did not, thereby confirming an element of freezing tolerance in the former.																	0307-6962					JUN	1992	17	2					148	152		10.1111/j.1365-3032.1992.tb01192.x								WOS:A1992HZ99700007

Cutting percentages within each size class indicate that this management technique represents a compromise between forest improvement and harvesting. Sprouting is the mean regeneration process of these holm-oak stands. The mean number of living sprouts per stool is considerably higher than in other coppiced hardwood species, and decreases along the cutting-cycle according to a negative exponential function. Mean number of surviving sprouts per stool is significantly correlated with regenerative age and stool size. Death of sprouts throughout the cutting cycle is compensated by growth of surviving sprouts. Thus, the weight of living sprouts per stool increases linearly with time, and also with the basal area coppiced. Sprouts developing within the first fifteen years of regeneration belong to a single cohort that appears during the first year after cutting. After that period of time, new sprouts appear from dormant buds, so that after 30 years of regeneration a wide range of cohorts of different ages are present.

At a dose of 0.75 brain equivalents, PTTH activity is highest in non-diapause-bound and diapausing prepupae. Levels are approx. 50% as high in younger 5th instars. In diapausing prepupae, PTTH activity again falls to approx. 50% after 5-8 weeks of refrigeration. Prothoracic glands from diapausing O. nubilalis prepupae were refractory to stimulation. In vivo experiments indicate that brains from diapausing prepupae have more moult-stimulating activity than those from non-diapause-bound prepupae. However, this may be due to the presence of factors other than PTTH. Based on gel filtration HPLC, the molecular weight range of the small form of O. nubilalis PTTH is 1500-3300 Da, somewhat less than the 5000-7000 Da peptide reported for other lepidopterans.																	0022-1910					MAY	1992	38	5					383	395		10.1016/0022-1910(92)90063-J								WOS:A1992HZ02700008

The percentage of females that entered diapause at 18-degrees-C and 9L:15D photoperiod ranged between 0 and 77%. In addition, both photoperiodic and temperature responses varied widely among these populations. We suggest that temperature response might be a better trait than photoperiodic response for selection among local populations. Females in diapause survived -24-degrees-C better than those that were not. However, no difference in cold hardiness among these populations was found. The mite responded rapidly to artificial selection for low and high diapause percentage. The response was asymmetrical, being easier in the direction of low diapause percentage. Reciprocal and back crosses using selected low and high diapause percentage cultures showed that the. genetic control of diapause was complicated. Neither the "low-diapause" nor the "high-diapause" trait dominated over the other. However, the "low-diapause" trait seemed to be stronger. The results of this study suggest that variation in diapause response is maintained by (1) adaptation to local environments and (2) the complexity of the genetics of diapause. Such variation may provide the genetic raw material for natural selection and is a prerequisite for the extension of ecological range.																	0029-8549					MAY	1992	90	2					270	275		10.1007/BF00317185								WOS:A1992HU05200015	28313723

The mean temperature inside the hibernaculum was 7.1-degrees-C and outside was 5.6-degrees-C. The mean relative humidity in the hibernaculum was 82% (range 67%-93%). The activity of the bats outside the hibernaculum was monitored by two Doppler radar units. The daily probability of an individual bat emerging from the hibernaculum was between 0.26 and 0.99. Emergence probability increased when there was food available and when it was warmer. The activity of the bats was strictly nocturnal, initial emergence occurring a mean of 64.4 min after sunset (n = 42, SD = 27.0 min). When denied access to food, the bats drank an average of 0.20 mL . bat-1 . night-1 on the nights that at least one emerged (n = 14 nights, SE = 0.05, range = 0.00-0.68). On warmer nights the bats were more active and ate and drank more than on colder nights. We suggest that typically in P. auritus winter flights may not be induced by the onset of starvation (and hence the need to feed) or by the onset of dehydration (and hence the need to drink). Rather, at typical winter temperatures P. auritus may fly frequently, almost daily, to try and ensure that neither energy nor water reserves approach critically low levels. Only during a prolonged cold period (mean night temperature < 4-degrees-C) might many days pass without a winter flight.

We found that newly hatched larvae from eggs collected from a population using plantain were heavier than those from a population using turtlehead. Nonetheless, both the prediapause and postdiapause larvae derived from the turtlehead population and fed turtlehead in a laboratory experiment gained more mass than those from the plantain population fed plantain. Collections of diapausing larvae from field sites corroborated that pattern. Regardless of the population source (i.e., those using either turtlehead or plantain), postdiapause larvae reared on turtlehead exhibited higher relative growth rate (RGR), efficiency of conversion of ingested food (ECI), and efficiency of conversion of digested food (ECD) than those fed plantain, even though approximate digestibility (AD) and leaf nitrogen concentrations were lower for turtlehead. Regardless of their population of origin, choice tests showed that newly hatched larvae preferred turtlehead. Likewise, adult females reared from larvae collected from both populations oviposited exclusively on turtlehead. Both C. glabra and P. lanceolata contain iridoid glycosides. The iridoid glycoside profile of butterflies reared on these two plants differed, reflecting the differences of the host plants. The shift of some populations of E. phaeton onto plantain is most likely a function of several ecological factors rather than genetic differentiation between populations using turtlehead and plantain.

During the prediapause period they accumulate triacylglycerols, but not glycogen, as energy resources. The capacity for storing triacylglycerols differs between species, and appears to be closely correlated with diapause and cold-hardiness; cool-temperate species, such as those of the auraria species complex, which enter a deep diapause and are highly cold-hardy, accumulate larger quantities of triacylglycerols than warm-temperate species, such as D. rufa and D. lutescens, which enter a weak diapause and are less cold-hardy. Among the cool-temperate species, D. subauraria occurs at a higher latitude and has the greatest capacity for accumulating triacylglycerols. A subtropical species, D. takahashii, which has no diapause in nature and is not cold-hardy, is unable to store the same quantities of triacylglycerols as temperate species.																	0174-1578					APR	1992	162	3					203	208		10.1007/BF00357524								WOS:A1992HR19100002	1613157					
J	PROBER, SM				PROBER, SM			ENVIRONMENTAL-INFLUENCES ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE RARE EUCALYPTUS-PALIFORMIS AND THE COMMON E-FRAXINOIDES	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Eucalyptus paliformis is restricted to seven small populations within an area of < 5 km2 on the Wadbilliga Plateau of south-eastern NSW. It occurs as a dominant tree in habitats superficially similar to those of the more widespread E. fraxinoides, which dominates forests immediately adjacent to the E. paliformis populations. This study examined factors which may influence the replacement of E. fraxinoides by E. paliformis, and similarly, factors which exclude E. paliformis from sites dominated by E. fraxinoides. Seedling growth and competition experiments indicated that E. fraxinoides outcompetes E. paliformis under unburnt field conditions, on field soils, under high and low moisture regimes, under high light and high nutrient conditions, and under a range of temperature regimes. Thus, it is likely that E. paliformis is excluded from E. fraxinoides sites by competition. However, further investigation of the competitive relationship between the two species under recently-burnt conditions is still required to test this hypothesis. The exclusion of E. fraxinoides from E. paliformis sites is unlikely to be due to soil types or moisture regimes. Further, temperature regimes do not appear to be important in reducing the competitive advantage of E. fraxinoides over E. paliformis, leaving survival at low temperature extremes as the most promising avenue for further investigation. Temperature measurements, and evidence for low temperature dormancy mechanisms in seeds of E. paliformis but not E. fraxinoides, support the hypothesis that E. fraxinoides is excluded from E. paliformis sites by low temperature extremes.

We present the results of a simulation model used to test whether between-year variance in mortality can lead to the persistence of multiple hatching strategies considered over an ecological time scale (50 years). The model is based on the general life history characteristics of a population of planktonic copepods (Diaptomus sanguineus) in Bullhead Pond, Rhode Island. Our model results demonstrate that, given a range of between-year variance in mortality, multiple strategies for timing of emergence can persist in a common environment for ecologically relevant periods of time. A qualitative test of the model comparing field estimates of mean and variance of mortality in Bullhead Pond with the region of persistence indicates that the model results are in approximate agreement with field estimates. The results suggest that variability in year-to-year selection pressures, such as predation or harsh winters, may play an important role in determining the evolution of life histories.																	0092-8240					MAR-MAY	1992	54	2-3					313	334		10.1016/S0092-8240(05)80029-1								WOS:A1992GZ98900009

Trirhabda bacharidis was usually univoltine. Larvae appeared in late winter-early summer, adults approximately two months later, and eggs then remained dormant until their eclosion at the end of winter. Natural hosts for the insect include B. halimifolia and B. neglecta Britton. Host specificity tests using 64 economically important plant species showed that both larvae and adults fed exclusively on Baccharis foliage and that the insect was safe to import into Australia. Trirhabda bacharidis was released in Australia in 1969 and established at a number of sites in southeastern Queensland. It showed poor dispersal powers and over the next 15 years was dispersed artificially. It eventually established on only a small proportion of the weed's range. In localized areas it caused severe defoliation. The insect changed its phenology in Australia, where larvae emerge in autumn and pupae overwinter. This change may have contributed to the failure to establish in many areas.				Palmer, William/D-7234-2011													0010-065X					MAR	1992	46	1					61	66										WOS:A1992HQ31600010

The egg development is interrupted by an obligatory diapause at an early stage of embryogenesis. The whole of the egg's incubation can be concluded at a constant temperature within the range 8-degrees-C-21-degrees-C. The intensity of diapause has been found to be directly correlated with rising temperatures from 11-degrees-C to 21-degrees-C, applied for 15 days immediately after egg laying. None of the experimental temperature regimes tested prevented the occurrence of diapause, the incubation period could however be reduced to a quarter of its natural duration thus allowing larvae to hatch before winter. These results afford a better understanding of the life cycle modifications observed throughout the geographical range. A rapid loss in the receptivity of the main host plant towards young larvae makes of an early diapause a necessity under the mediterranean climate.																	0013-8703					MAR	1992	62	3					277	284		10.1111/j.1570-7458.1992.tb00668.x								WOS:A1992HQ64100009

The trial was carried out in the autumn on a non-outbreak population of second instar larvae on Rubus sp. bushes in southern England. Despite erratic droplet coverage generated by a hand held, fan assisted ULV sprayer (Turbair Fox), a series of doses produced a clearly defined primary infection response peaking at ca. 70% at 1 x 10(9) PIBs/ml. The development of these infections was slow and most mortality occurred during or shortly after winter diapause. Secondary infection peaks in the spring were unpredictable, but occurred in many plots across the dose range. The data suggest that the virus would be a useful, environmentally acceptable insecticide for control of this insect in sensitive areas during pest outbreaks.																	0931-2048	1439-0418				MAR	1992	113	3					295	306		10.1111/j.1439-0418.1992.tb00667.x								WOS:A1992HM30700011

Egg production averaged 23.96 +/- 0.83 eggs per female per day and was greatest from 2400 to 0300 hours and lowest from 0700 to 0900 hours and from 1700 to 1900 hours. Daily fecal deposition was 0.77 +/- 0.03 mg feces per flea and did not vary significantly among hours. Flea eggs and adult feces were dropped continuously from infested cats, but significantly more eggs were shed at times of day when cats normally rest. More feces are concentrated in the small areas where cats rest than over the large areas they roam. Consequently, eggs and feces would not be deposited uniformly throughout the hosts home range, resulting in a clumped distribution of larval development sites at host resting areas.																	0022-2585					MAR	1992	29	2					203	206		10.1093/jmedent/29.2.203								WOS:A1992HG77200011	1495030

J	LANDA, K				LANDA, K			SEASONAL DECLINES IN OFFSPRING FITNESS AND SELECTION FOR EARLY REPRODUCTION IN NYMPH-OVERWINTERING GRASSHOPPERS	EVOLUTION												In this study, I examine the effects of natural and experimentally induced variation in life cycle timing on offspring fitness in Arphia sulphurea and Chortophaga viridifasciata, to understand the selective pressures shaping phenology in these two species of nymph-overwintering grasshoppers. Because these species lack embryonic diapause, hatching varies over a two month range under natural conditions. I used a cold treatment to delay hatching of some egg pods and extend the natural range of hatching dates. Due to the shorter time for growth and poorer growing conditions late in the fall, late-hatching nymphs of both species grew to a smaller size before winter and suffered higher overwinter mortality, compared to early nymphs. In addition, late nymphs that did survive the winter became reproductive later in the following year's breeding season. Size-dependent mortality of offspring during the winter is a strong selective pressure favoring early reproduction in these species. Female adult life history traits appear responsive to the seasonal declines in offspring fitness, in that late-maturing females began reproducing sooner after adult maturation and reproduced at a more rapid rate, even at the expense of having shorter adult longevity and producing fewer total egg pods. Experimental manipulations were crucial in understanding the fitness consequences of intrapopulation variation in the timing of specific life-cycle events for these species.																	0014-3820					FEB	1992	46	1					121	135		10.2307/2409809								WOS:A1992HD99300010	28564957					
J	GROETERS, FR; SHAW, DD				GROETERS, FR; SHAW, DD			ASSOCIATION BETWEEN LATITUDINAL VARIATION FOR EMBRYONIC-DEVELOPMENT TIME AND CHROMOSOME STRUCTURE IN THE GRASSHOPPER CALEDIA-CAPTIVA (ORTHOPTERA, ACRIDIDAE)	EVOLUTION												From southeastern Queensland to southern Victoria over a transect of 11-degrees latitude, the Moreton taxon of the Australian grasshopper Caledia captiva exhibits a cline in chromosome structure that involves change from a metacentric to an acrocentric genome. In this study, we show that embryonic development time covaries with chromosome structure along the transect. Both development time and chromosome short arm length exhibit an overall negative correlation with latitude, but with maxima just south of the northern limit of the taxon's distribution. Selection for such a pattern appears to arise from changes in voltinism along the cline in season length that exists along the transect. Populations with the highest temperature thresholds for avoidance of embryonic diapause also have the slowest development time and probably represent the northern extreme of a primarily univoltine life cycle. North of this region bivoltinism increases in frequency and, as expected from a split of the season length, development time decreases. Maximum chromosome short arm length occurs in the vicinity of the northern univoltine populations, rather than at the limit of distribution where bivoltinism prevails. We conclude that variation in chromosome structure could be contributing to the heritable variation for development time that forms the basis for adaptive change in this trait. These results provide justification for investigating causal relationships between chromosome structure and development time, with an ultimate aim of understanding the adaptive significance of chromosomal variation in C. captiva.																	0014-3820	1558-5646				FEB	1992	46	1					245	257		10.2307/2409819								WOS:A1992HD99300020	28564964

Although risk is high in industrialized societies, it is low in nonindustrialized areas. The search for the causes of breast cancer has not yet yielded a convincing explanation for the geographic and temporal patterns in the occurrence of breast cancer. Generation of electric power is a hallmark of industrialization, and two products of electric power, light-at-night (LAN) and electromagnetic fields (EMF), may affect breast cancer risk. Exposure to either LAN or EMF can decrease production of melatonin by the pineal gland. Melatonin, in turn, has been shown to suppress mammary tumorigenesis in experimental animals. Moreover, recent epidemiological findings indicate an increased risk of breast cancer in workers occupationally exposed to EMF. On the basis of these considerations, it is proposed that the use of electrical power accounts, in part, for the higher risks of breast cancer in industrialized societies.																	0892-6638	1530-6860				FEB 1	1992	6	3					853	860										WOS:A1992HE39000008	1740235

The date of budburst seems to be the most important factor that determines which species of Abietoideae are suitable. However, because of both the interpopulation variation in the date at which the budworm larvae emerge from hibernation, and the variable phenology within each Abietoideae species, it is improbable that the selection exercised by this factor would be very severe. C. murinana can complete its entire life cycle on the following European Abietoideae: Abies alba, A. borisii regis, A. cephalonica and Picea abies. This latter, however, is a very poor quality host, and it even seems that the budworm can maintain persistent populations on it only if it occurs with A. alba. The resistance of P. abies to the budworm might be the result both of a late budburst date and tough scales covering the tips of its swelling buds. As a consequence of the increasing use of various exotic Abietoideae species in Europe for both ornamental and forestry purposes, the host range of C. murinana is likely to increase. For example, it has already become established on Cedrus atlantica, and there is evidence that it is capable of establishing itself on Abies grandis, Pseudotsuga menziesii, and most of the Mediterranean Abies, including A. nordmanniana.																	0931-2048					FEB	1992	113	1					18	40										WOS:A1992HE41400004						
J	GEHRKEN, U; SOUTHON, TE				GEHRKEN, U; SOUTHON, TE			SUPERCOOLING IN A FREEZE-TOLERANT CRANE-FLY LARVA, TIPULA SP	JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY												The freezing curves of individuals of Tipula sp. revealed two markedly separate freezing events during winter. The initial freezing event occurred at about -3-degrees-C, the second at about -5-degrees-C. Larvae survived freezing to -10-degrees-C and contained about 30% unfreezable water. Larvae ligated close to the anus supercooled to -5-degrees-C, yet did not survive freezing. The drop in relative water content from about 81-76% gave rise to a somewhat smaller depression of haemolymph melting point than what should be expected from the water loss. Thus, the data indicated that osmolytes must have been removed rather than added to the body fluid of hibernating larvae. Ice-nucleating agents present in excised alimentary tracts and in haemolymph samples promoted freezing in the temperature range from -5 to -7-degrees-C. In larvae ligated close to the anus to prevent a leakage of rectal water, freezing occurred at temperatures equivalent to those of their excised alimentary tracts which contained the most powerful ice nucleators in the organism. Therefore, rectal fluid which moistens the body surface surrounding the anus, appeared to be the prime nucleating site. Thus, freezing is initiated when rectal fluid freezes outside the animal and ice propagates throughout the tissue. The remarkably high supercooling point of intact larvae moreover suggests that they rely upon freezing by inoculation rather than by extracellular ice nucleators.																	0022-1910	1879-1611				FEB	1992	38	2					131	137		10.1016/0022-1910(92)90042-C								WOS:A1992HM10700007

In two Nature Reserves in the wheatbelt of Western Australia, 10 adults and six juveniles were radio-tracked for 11 months during 1988. Animals were weighed monthly and their fresh faeces collected for dietary analysis. Available termite and ant energy was measured simultaneously in habitats where the echidnas foraged: woodland, mallee**, shrubland and heath. Termite energy formed the principal food of echidnas, possibly because of their greater abundance. Highest ingestion rates of termite energy during the hottest time of year may reflect increased moisture requirements. Adult animals preferred woodland and mallee for foraging, possibly because termite and ant energy was highest there. Juveniles exhibited no obvious habitat preference. Echidnas were active year-round, with foraging peaks during spring and autumn, and animals gained weight then. Despite termite energy being highest in winter, echidnas were in negative energy balance during this period, possibly because they make smaller foraging efforts and have higher thermoregulatory costs. Foraging was principally nocturnal in summer, and mixed nocturnal/diurnal in winter. No foraging was observed below 9-degrees and above 32-degrees-C, with a preferred range of 16-20-degrees-C. Echidnas were not apparently food-limited because: (a) both adult and juvenile animals maintained, or gained, body weight even when termite energy was low; (b) juveniles foraged anywhere, irrespective of habitat, but still gained weight; and (c) there was no evidence for hibernation by wheatbelt echidnas, unlike in other parts of Australia where echidnas routinely hibernate in winter, possibly in response to food shortage. However, echidnas did show signs of short-term torpor. Echidnas were active throughout the year, possibly because food was unlimited, and because use of subterranean shelter reduced thermoregulatory costs. The results of this study suggest that food distribution and ambient temperature play an important role in influencing daily and seasonal foraging activity in wheatbelt echidnas.																	0952-8369					FEB	1992	226		2				243	257		10.1111/j.1469-7998.1992.tb03837.x								WOS:A1992HE27200005

The frequency of such prolonged diapause has been studied in the same natural population of the chestnut weevil (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) during six years. The proportion of adults emerging from a cohort of larvae after two or more years was high and varied from 0.32 to 0.56. The overall survival rate from larvae to adults was highly variable, from 0.04 to 0.31. By adding COUTIN'S data (1961 and unpublished) to ours, we created 9 cohorts. A model was built to estimate the annual survival rate and probabilities of 1-year (alpha1) and 2 or 3-year (alpha2) diapause termination. The two probabilities were equal in 2 cohorts. In the seven others alpha1 was always lower than a2: average respectively 0.21 and 0.63 for our data, 0.43 and 0.92 for COURIN'S. The observed prolonged diapause frequency badly estimates the probability of prolonged diapause termination since the observed value depends on the survival rate. The importance of prolonged diapause in chestnut weevil populations is emphasized and several hypotheses are proposed for interpreting the high frequency of prolonged diapause.

Developmental zero (almost-equal-to 10-degrees-C) and thermal constant for larval plus pupal development (139 degree-days (DD) for male and 150 for female) did not differ among the four strains. First follicles of females reared at 15-degrees-C and a photophase of 10 h (hereinafter designated as degrees-C-h) were shorter than those at 28-degrees-C-16 h by almost-equal-to 15% in both New Zealand and Fiji strains. Feeding rates of Fiji females were little influenced by temperature-day length conditions. Feeding rates of New Zealand strains decreased under low temperature-short day length conditions, but almost-equal-to 30% of females took blood within 1 mo after emergence at 15-degrees-10 h. In contrast, females from Saga, north temperate Japan, had conspicuously smaller (reduction rate almost-equal-to 50%) follicles at 15-degrees-C-10 h and rarely took blood within 2 mo after emergence. It was concluded that New Zealand strains of C. quinquefasciatus have no distinct ovarian diapause. Southernmost distributions of C. quinquefasciatus reported in the literature correspond well to the July 10-degrees-C isotherm in the Southern Hemisphere, but considerable discrepancies exist between northernmost distributions and the january 10-degrees-C isotherm in the Northern Hemisphere.																	0013-8746					JAN	1992	85	1					58	66		10.1093/aesa/85.1.58								WOS:A1992HB55200009

No differences were found between the means or the variances of body temperatures of animals during day-time rest in stream-bank burrows and those during night-time foraging in winter at temperatures as low as 1.0-degrees-C.																	0004-959X						1992	40	2					135	142		10.1071/ZO9920135								WOS:A1992JE29800003						
J	JONES, RE				JONES, RE			PHENOTYPIC VARIATION IN AUSTRALIAN EUREMA SPECIES	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Australian butterflies in the tropical pierid genus Eurema (the grass yellows) exhibit seasonal phenotypic changes in both size and colour pattern. In four of the five species, smaller adults were present during the summer and autumn wet season than during the cooler winter-spring dry season. The fifth species, E. hecabe, showed the reverse pattern, being largest when it first appeared late in the wet season and becoming smaller as the dry season progressed. When reared in the laboratory, however, all five species produced larger adults when reared at lower temperatures, and at least two of the species also produced larger adults at shorter photoperiods. In the case of E. hecabe, juvenile overcrowding and resource limitation may prevent the potential size increase during the cooler dry season from occurring. All five species had darker markings during the cooler dry season, and in two of them, E. herla and E. laeta, there was also a change in the ground colour of the underwing from yellow to pink or brown. The darker markings may serve a thermoregulatory function, as in other pierids, but the change in colour probably functions to allow E. herla and E. laeta, which diapause as adults during the dry season, to be more cryptic as the grasslands they occupy dry off and change colour. In all species except E. herla, the range of variation in dark markings observed in the field could be reproduced in the laboratory by varying the temperatures and/or photoperiods at which the juvenile stages were reared (darker individuals were produced at lower temperatures and shorter photoperiods). The change in ground colour in E. herla and E. laeta, however, was not reproduced in laboratory rearings, either by changing photoperiod and temperatures, or by rearing animals at low humidities, suggesting that an additional cue may be needed to induce this shift in phenotype.

This study evaluated effects of laboratory culture and test procedures on Ceriodaphnia dubia survival and reproduction. Parameters such as temperature, food concentration, beaker size, solution-renewal frequency, light quality, illumination, photoperiod, water type, and test organism age were evaluated to determine how these culture and test parameters affected individual culturing success and acceptability and reproducibility of toxicity test results. Test parameters proposed by the EPA were evaluated under controlled laboratory conditions by varying levels of individual environmental or experimental design parameters to determine an acceptable range of responses for survival and reproduction, both with and without a reference toxicant. For those parameters not specified by the EPA (e.g., water hardness, light quality), commonly used ranges for those parameters were evaluated. Results provided a decision matrix of acceptable ranges for individual environmental and experimental design parameters that were used to optimize the test parameters for conducting 7-d effluent tests with Ceriodaphnia dubia. Overall, of the studied test parameters, renewal frequency and photoperiod were the primary factors affecting culture and toxicity test success. In this study, the EPA restriction on Ceriodaphnia dubia age at test initiation was not critical, as long as all organisms were <24 h old and randomly distributed among the test concentrations.																	0730-7268						1992	11	6					839	850		10.1897/1552-8618(1992)11[839:EOEAED]2.0.CO;2								WOS:A1992HY97600012						
J	TANAKA, K				TANAKA, K			PHOTOPERIODIC CONTROL OF DIAPAUSE AND CLIMATIC ADAPTATION OF THE HOUSE SPIDER, ACHAEARANEA-TEPIDARIORUM (ARANEAE, THERIDIIDAE)	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												1. To elucidate the climatic adaptation of the house spider, Achaearanea tepidariorum, the photoperiodic response regulating diapause and the overwintering stage were compared between the 'temperate' Hirosaki and the 'subtropical' Okinawa strains. 2. Both strains could enter diapause in the nymphal and imaginal stages and photoperiod was a primary factor inducing it. In each strain, the critical photoperiod for diapause induction did not differ between nymphal and imaginal stages. There was, however, about 3h difference in the critical photoperiod between the two strains. It was longer in the temperate strain than in the subtropical strain. 3. The nymphal diapausing stadia also differed geographically; it was highly variable in the temperate strain, but was fixed at the final nymphal instar in the subtropical strain. In spite of the local difference in the diapausing stadia, all nymphal stadia and adults were found during winter in the field at both Hirosaki and Okinawa. 4. These observations suggest that the adaptive significance of diapause in the subtropical strain is to control the timing of reproduction, rather than to enhance the winter survival of the diapausing individual itself.																	0269-8463						1992	6	5					545	552		10.2307/2390051								WOS:A1992JQ89000006

The model is expressed as a circle-map relating time of year at maturation in successive generations. The properties of this map enable us to determine the degree of synchrony to be expected between the life-cycles of members of a population exposed to a regular seasonal environment. We have proved that organisms with a life-history composed of a contiguous series of stages, all with development driven by the same seasonal function, cannot phase-lock their life-cycles to the seasons. However if the organism exhibits facultative diapause induced by a critical time/critical development mechanism of the type proposed by Norling (1984a,b,c) then it will always succeed in phase-locking to a perfectly periodic driving function. Within the context of this circle-map model we have examined population extinctions caused by attempting to over-winter in an inappropriate life-history stage, or by attempting to reproduce at a time of year when this is impossible. We have shown that the possibility of such extinctions limits both the shortness of the post-critical stage, and the lateness of the critical time. We have examined the fitness of persistent cohorts as a function of critical time and development. We find that if the post-critical stage is riskier than the pre-critical then natural selection favors a short post-critical stage and a late critical time; the limitation of this process being dependent on the proportion of the growing season over which successful reproduction is possible. We have determined the variation with life-cycle length (and hence latitude or altitude) of the maturation pattern corresponding to optimal life-history parameters. We find that for organisms which can mature only over a small part of the growing season the majority of any latitudinal gradient exhibits a unimodal maturation pattern. Organisms which can mature and reproduce over the majority of the growing season exhibit more complex patterns, but still exhibit substantial ranges of latitude over which unimodal or bimodal patterns are optimal.

J	BELL, CH				BELL, CH			TIME, CONCENTRATION AND TEMPERATURE RELATIONSHIPS FOR PHOSPHINE ACTIVITY IN TESTS ON DIAPAUSING LARVAE OF EPHESTIA-ELUTELLA (HUBNER) (LEDIDOPTERA, PYRALIDAE)	PESTICIDE SCIENCE												The activity of phosphine against diapausing larvae of Ephestia elutella was shown to depend on several different interactions of duration of exposure, temperature and gas concentration. Using the model proposed by Knight, (C - C0) x (t - t0) = k, a constant for mortality, the minimum effective concentration C0 was raised and the minimum effective exposure t0 extended as temperatures were increased. The effect of temperature on these thresholds was reduced at higher mortality levels. A range of concentration levels, influenced by temperature, elicited an increase in tolerance at the LD99 level over that evident at higher or lower concentrations. These concentration ranges were 0.9-2.1 mg litre-1 at 25-degrees-C, 0.7-2.3 mg litre-1 at 20-degrees-C and 0.1-1.5 mg litre-1 at 15-degrees-C. A mathematical model was fitted to relate concentration and time thresholds, mortality and temperature. At the LD50 level, values for t0 ranged from 2.5 h at 15-degrees-C to 5.0 h at 25-degrees-C. C0 values increased from about 0.6 to 7.0-mu-g litre-1 over this temperature range. At the LD99 level, t0 values ranged from 21 to 28 h and C0 values from 11 to 19-mu-g litre-1. Phosphine appeared most effective at each temperature at concentrations from about 40 to 60-100-mu-g litre-1.																	0031-613X						1992	35	3					255	264		10.1002/ps.2780350310								WOS:A1992JK72000009

Up to 13 weeks of waterlogging had little effect on form and growth rates of above-ground parts of two clones of Salix caprea L. and one clone of S. cinerea L. A second clone of S. cinerea responded differently to the other three clones by significantly increasing its leaf area and stem dry weight, suggesting that it is likely to be more tolerant of waterlogging. Plant parts below the waterline in the waterlogging treatment responded very differently to the same parts on control plants. All waterlogged plants developed hypertrophied lenticels within four weeks, followed by significant increases in stem diameter. In each clone most of the pre-existing root system died by the end of the waterlogging treatment. All clones formed adventitious roots which varied considerably between the species and to a lesser extent between clones within each species. In S. cinerea many short, fine, much-branched roots grew vertically upwards until they reached the water surface. In S. cinerea clone 90 they originated from both the pre-existing woody roots and from the hypertrophied lenticels on the submerged portions of the stems. In S. cinerea clone 12 they developed only from the hypertrophied lenticels. New roots produced by waterlogged S. caprea clones were long, sparsely branched and floated on or near the surface of the water. As in S. cinerea clone 90 they originated from both the pre-existing woody roots and the submerged hypertrophied lenticels. Whereas roots of the control plants of all clones were mostly ectomycorrhizal, those of the waterlogged plants had no mycorrhizae. In a second waterlogging experiment S. x sericans, S. viminalis and S. fragilis produced adventitious roots more like those of S. caprea than S. cinerea. Plants of all clones removed from the waterlogging treatment after 16 days and kept with their soil at field capacity thereafter produced many new roots from their old root balls. After 32 days waterlogging no such recovery occurred. Total submersion caused much more severe damage to the aerial parts of all tested species than waterlogging. After eight days submersion the shoot tips of S. fragilis were beginning to rot and by day 25 those of S. x sericans and S. viminalis were rotting too. Subsequently shoots developed from axillary buds which remained unaffected by rot throughout the experiment. In S. cinerea shoot growth ceased after eight days and terminal buds were formed which remained dormant but healthy throughout the experiment. Submersion caused progressive loss of pre-existing leaves in all species. Some newly formed leaves of each species developed epinastic deformities after > 16 days of submersion. All species except S. cinerea showed significant reductions in root dry weight after 32 days of submersion. In a second submersion experiment responses of three clones each of S. purpurea and S. viminalis were compared. Shoot growth was reduced significantly in four of the six clones after 14 days. No further reductions occurred in the next 14 days of submersion. Root dry weight also decreased, but it took 28 days of submersion to produce the greatest effect. The faster growing clones of each species were more adversely affected by submersion in terms of both reduced shoot growth and root growth than those which grew more slowly. Considerable intraspecific variability in responses to waterlogging and submersion have been shown in these experiments by clones not selected for their variation in flooding tolerance. This suggests that selection and breeding could lead to the development of flood-tolerant cultivars of species such as S. cinerea and S. caprea which are not noted for their ability to withstand inundation.																	0308-2113						1992	98						21	48		10.1017/S0269727000007430								WOS:A1992HW57500004						
J	RAVEN, JA				RAVEN, JA			THE PHYSIOLOGY OF SALIX	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF EDINBURGH SECTION B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Salix has many physiological features in common with other deciduous woody plants, e.g. C3 photosynthesis, occurrence of latitudinal photoperiodic ecotypes, and organic N (no NO3--N) flux to the shoot in the xylem. Special points about the physiology of Salix spp. which may have impact on their ecology and economic uses include: (i) relatively high (for woody plants) light-saturated rate of photosynthesis on a leaf area or leaf dry weight basis, (ii) sex differences in water (transpiration) costs of growth, (iii) very limited seed longevity and a wide range of temperature and light conditions permitting germination, and (iv) ready rooting and establishment of naturally or artificially detached twigs and branches. Areas in which work on Salix has been especially influential for the development of plant physiology include: (i) the analysis of phloem functioning using aphids, (ii) the role of photoinhibition under natural conditions, and (iii) the realisation that the woody habit need not constrain the achieved activity of enzymes and hence N-based metabolic rates.																	0308-2113						1992	98						49	62		10.1017/S0269727000007442								WOS:A1992HW57500005

The analysis confirmed that the between-sources variaton pattern of height growth in jack pine populations is shaped by thermo- and photoperiodic effects. The geographical pattern is latitudinally clinal but weakly expressed. For calculating the response regression surface, the variable ''ecological distance'' was introduced as a measure of environment change for the transferred sources. The developed model illustrates a generally observable trend of superiority (or at least equal performance) of sources transferred moderately northward as compared to the local source. The existence of obvious adaptation to harsher conditions as the local is interpreted as ''adaptation lag''. Mortality caused by maladaptation and predicted performance of transferred populations was used to propose safe limits of transfer.																	0037-5349						1992	41	6					370	376										WOS:A1992KQ51800011						
J	ROSEN, PC				ROSEN, PC			COMPARATIVE ECOLOGY AND LIFE-HISTORY OF THE RACER (COLUBER-CONSTRICTOR) IN MICHIGAN	COPEIA												The racer, Coluber constrictor foxii, was studied over a six-year period in southeastern Michigan. The minimum age at maturity was 11 months in males and two years in females. Both sexes grew rapidly, exceeded 600 mm SVL at the end of the first full season of growth, and individuals of both sexes attained SVL > 1300 mm. There was no sexual size dimorphism. Autumn body mass was correlated strongly with SVL (r = 0.994). There was a single clutch per year averaging 15.0 eggs, and clutch size was positively correlated with female SVL (r = 0.937). All hatchlings and some yearlings overwintered at dispersed locations, while some yearlings and all large adults overwintered at communal dens. Adults dispersed up to at least 2.2 km from major hibernacula. During the warm season, mean distance between recaptures was 424 m for large adults, 188 m for yearlings, and 62 m for small juveniles. These traits indicate high rates of energy acquisition and use. In contrast, adult survivorship appears to have been low, at an estimated 0.54 per annum. Adult and subadult survivorship appear to be uncertain because of winter frost penetration, consistent with a bet-hedging hypothesis explaining life-history differences among this population and those previously studied in Kansas and Utah. Published data on variation of body size throughout the geographic range of the racer were examined to test this hypothesis; small body sizes found in subspecies inhabiting relatively stable climatic regions were not consistent with the hypothesis. Instead, racer size and diet, and the presence of snake species with similar habits and diets, were correlated across the geographic range of the racer.																	0045-8511					DEC 13	1991		4					897	909		10.2307/1446085								WOS:A1991GW22100002						
J	PEN, LJ; POTTER, IC				PEN, LJ; POTTER, IC			REPRODUCTION, GROWTH AND DIET OF GAMBUSIA-HOLBROOKI (GIRARD) IN A TEMPERATE AUSTRALIAN RIVER	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												1. The biology of Gambusia holbrooki in the Collie River in southwestern Australia is described using data obtained from seine samples collected at 4-6 weekly intervals over two years. 2. Females which had overwintered in the river bred between October and February (spring-breeding group) and then died. Some of the large representatives of the resultant cohort of males and females bred between January and March (summer-breeding group) and then also died. The offspring of these larger individuals and the smaller fish did not start breeding until the following spring, when they constituted the spring-breeding group of the following breeding season. Breeding occurred when temperatures were above 15-16-degrees-C and day length exceeded 750-780 min. The increase in the mean length of the spring group of pregnant females from 33 mm in October to 52 mm in January was accompanied by a rise in mean fecundity from 33 to 131. 3. In the Collie River, G. holbrooki is a generalist carnivore, feeding at the water surface and throughout the water column. Gut contents of a wide size range of G. holbrooki from each season contained neither the eggs, larvae, juveniles nor adults of any of the three indigenous fish species found in the system. Moreover, there was no evidence that G. holbrooki exhibited agonistic behaviour, such as fin clipping, towards these native fish. 4. Coexistence of the three indigenous species with G. holbrooki, and thereby their conservation, is facilitated by the outcome of different spawning times and localities. Thus, the early life-history stages of the indigenous species, which are most susceptible to predation, are typically produced in tributary creeks or flood waters between late winter and late spring, some time before the breeding of G. holbrooki results in a population explosion of this exotic species in the main channel of the river during summer.																	1052-7613					DEC	1991	1	2					159	172		10.1002/aqc.3270010205								WOS:A1991HG05300004

If this is so, species with unusually northerly distributions should be unusually cold tolerant. We compared the northerly distributed Papilio canadensis with its southern relative, P. glaucus. Pupae were exposed for 2-5 months to four acclimatization treatments: outdoors in Alaska, outdoors in Michigan constant 5-degrees-C. Field temperatures encountered by pupae in Alaska were lower than in Michigan. The supercooling point of P. glaucus pupae was unaffected by acclimatization (mean +/- SE = -23.5 +/- 0.52-degrees-C). The supercooling point of P. canadensis pupae did not differ from that of P. glaucus pupae, except following acclimatization in Alaska, when it dropped to -27.0 +/- 0.55-degrees-C. Survival of pupae in Michigan was high for all populations (70-90%); in Alaska, survival of P. canadensis was just as high, but survival of P. glaucus dropped to 14%. Freezing was usually fatal in both species, but death was not immediate. No pupae survived 6 weeks at -25-degrees-C. Trehalose was the most conspicuous metabolite revealed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of live pupae and hemolymph. Labelled glucose was metabolized differently by the two species, which may underly the difference in acclimation potential and cold tolerance. The results support the hypothesis that winter temperatures limit swallowtail distributions.																	0008-4301					DEC	1991	69	12					3028	3037		10.1139/z91-427								WOS:A1991HL31300015

The first is that the amplitude of the pacemaker's motion, unlike its period, is markedly temperature-dependent. The second is that latitudinal variation in pacemaker amplitude (higher in the north) is responsible for two very different sets of observations on Drosophila circadian systems at successively higher latitudes. One of these is a cline in D. auraria's phase-shifting response to light, which steadily weakens in a succession of more northerly strains. The other, concerning D. littoralis in the very far north, is a cline in the rate at which eclosion activity becomes arrhythmic (the circadian rhythm damps out) in constant darkness; damping is faster in the north. The third proposition concerns a plausible selection pressure for the cline in pacemaker amplitude that we propose underlies the two directly observed clines. Two points are emphasized: (1) The amplitude of the pacemaker's daily oscillation declines as the duration of the entraining light pulse (photoperiod) is increased; and (2) the duration of the daily photoperiods throughout the breeding season is steadily increased as one moves toward the poles. Selection for conservation of pacemaker amplitude (during the breeding season) would produce the latitudinal cline we propose. The fourth, and final proposition is that since the amplitude of the pacemaker's daily motion responds systematically to change in photoperiod, amplitude is clearly one way-and a temperature-dependent way-in which insect circadian systems may sense seasonal change. These propositions concerning the temperature and latitude dependence of pacemaker amplitude may be relevant to a wider array of circadian pacemakers than Drosophila.																	0748-7304					WIN	1991	6	4					299	313		10.1177/074873049100600402								WOS:A1991GR91000002	1773097

In its seasonal migrations in eastern Asia, this armyworm penetrates to latitudes at which it is unable to over-winter but at which reliable photoperiodic and temperature cues anticipate the deterioration of conditions. The effect of these environmental factors on PCP was examined in moths descended from samples collected in Nanjing (32-degrees-N) during the summer migration. Under LD 14:10 h, a reduction in temperature, from 23-degrees-C during larval development to 18-degrees-C from 24 h after pupation, resulted in a twofold increase in PCP compared with insects held at 23-degrees-C. At 23-degrees-C, short days (LD 12:12 h) extended PCP but the magnitude of the response was increased under a regime of decreasing photoperiod, from LD 15:9 h, to LD 12:12 h through larval, pupal and adult development. Further experiments demonstrated that the response depended on a decrease in photoperiod from pre-pupal stage to adult emergence (the pupal period is spent below ground). A reduction of 50-60 min over the 13-15 day pupal period at 23-degrees-C was effective. The significance of decreasing photoperiods, irrespective of absolute levels, as a cue for species whose migrations traverse substantial ranges of latitude is considered and the results are discussed in relation to the genetic determination of PCP in M. separata and to its seasonal migrations in eastern China.																	0307-6962					DEC	1991	16	4					419	427		10.1111/j.1365-3032.1991.tb00580.x								WOS:A1991GU14200004

Diapause percentages at 18-degrees-C/9L15D varied from nearly 100% in the north to 0% in the south-west. At intermediate latitudes the mites showed wide inter-population variations. Populations on herbaceous hosts in vinyl- or glass-houses gave significantly lower incidence of diapause than those on roses and deciduous fruit trees. Presence of winter hosts and better host quality under protected environments seemed to favour non-diapausing mites. The temperature threshold for diapause expression also varied widely among local populations. Northern populations consistently had higher and less variable thresholds than populations at intermediate latitudes with thresholds between 15 and 18-degrees-C. Inbred lines derived from a population in Kyoto exhibited a wide variation in diapause percentage at 18-degrees-C. These results show that diapause in T. urticae is a quantitative threshold trait and that populations in central Japan consist of a variety of genotypes with different diapause traits. This might provide a genetic source for adaptation to local and temporal variations in environmental conditions.																	0034-5466					DEC	1991	33	2					331	344		10.1007/BF02513558								WOS:A1991HC06400014

When genetically similar populations were maintained at 24-degrees-C and exposed to photoperiods from 14:10 to 10:14 (L:D), autogeny was suppressed from a mean of 26% progressively to 1%. When all stages were maintained at 21-degrees-C, pupae were photosensitive (i.e., the percentage of autogenous females was not affected by photoperiods at which larvae were maintained). The percentage of autogenous females in field populations followed the seasonal changes in temperature and photoperiod, demonstrating environmental regulation of facultative autogeny. Autogeny appeared to be genetically stable in Cx. tarsalis. Single families from a long standing laboratory colony (> 60 generations) had the same range (0-80%) in percentage of autogenous females per family as did recent field-collected families from the same geographical location.																	0022-2585					NOV	1991	28	6					847	853		10.1093/jmedent/28.6.847								WOS:A1991GQ59500015	1770520

(Coleoptera: Scolytidae) from five locations (ca 300 km apart) in Sweden and Denmark. Beetles of northerly origin emerged later from brood logs. This pattern was associated with an increasing proportion on non-fliers towards the north. After over-wintering, both the rate of development of flight activity and the proportion of non-fliers were the same among populations. Flight duration of fliers was similar among populations and appeared unaffected by outbreak conditions.																	0013-8703					OCT	1991	61	1					53	57		10.1111/j.1570-7458.1991.tb02395.x								WOS:A1991GR52400007						
J	HAN, EN; GATEHOUSE, AG				HAN, EN; GATEHOUSE, AG			GENETICS OF PRECALLING PERIOD IN THE ORIENTAL ARMYWORM, MYTHIMNA-SEPARATA (WALKER) (LEPIDOPTERA, NOCTUIDAE), AND IMPLICATIONS FOR MIGRATION	EVOLUTION												Migration in insects usually occurs prereproductively so the precalling period, between emergence and the first release of pheromone, determines the number of nights over which females of migrants such as Mythimna separata can express their migratory potential. Precalling periods (PCP's) ranged from 3 to 21 nights in F1 females from insects collected in the field in eastern China. As technical problems precluded the use of a sib-analysis design, the genetic basis of this variation was investigated by analysis of the correlation between daughters' and mother's PCP's and by selection in isofemale lines followed by reciprocal crosses. The results of these analyses indicated that PCP is strongly influenced by genes located on the X chromosome, inherited from the male parent in Lepidoptera. Genetic regulation of migratory potential, of which PCP is a crucial component, can be expected to evolve in tropical species such as Mythimna separata, whose larval habitats are associated with unpredictable tropical rainfall. This species has no preimaginal diapause but makes regular seasonal incursions every spring and early summer to high temperate latitudes at which it cannot overwinter. Where migrants are carried by winds, as occurs in these migrations, the predominantly poleward winds at this time of year must create a genetic cline across latitude, in which migratory potential of the summer populations founded by the migrants increases with increasing latitude. We suggest that X-linkage of genes influencing PCP may reduce the genetic load associated with this polymorphism by reducing the frequencies of inappropriate PCP genotypes in these summer populations. Thus, in autumn when winds are predominantly northerly, fewer individuals at any latitude will lack the capability to make the return journey southward. Some support for this model is provided by the observed distributions of PCP's of F1 females from moths collected in the field in central and northern eastern China. If X-linkage of genes influencing PCP contributes to the stability of these migratory cycles, it can be expected in other species with similar migratory strategies.																	0014-3820					SEP	1991	45	6					1502	1510		10.2307/2409896								WOS:A1991GH35900016	28563818

Last-instar densities ranged from 0.54 to 3.18 per cone. This was considered a wide range for this species in red pine. Population clumping was evident at last-instar densities below 2.90, however no consistent pattern was evident between years. Clumping disappeared at populations greater than 2.90 last-instars. Prolonged diapause varied from 7.8 to 38.9 %. Parasitism rates varied from 10.9 to 46.6 %. Phanerotoma toreuta (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) was the most abundant parasite at both sites and emerged in unison with male C. toreuta. Estimation of percent of last-instars undergoing prolonged diapause prior to spring emergence can be accomplished using forced emergence though cones should be collected after 31 January. Estimation of percent parasitism can be made as early as November. Resident moth populations could be estimated prior to spring flight utilizing this information. Emergence occurred over an approximately 2 week period between mid-May and early June. The majority of male moths emerged prior to females.																	0090-0222					FAL	1991	24	3					145	152										WOS:A1991HA11600003						
J	CONDON, RG				CONDON, RG			BIRTH SEASONALITY, PHOTOPERIOD, AND SOCIAL-CHANGE IN THE CENTRAL CANADIAN ARCTIC	HUMAN ECOLOGY												Birth seasonality at high latitudes is a complex phenomenon which is undoubtedly affected by a subtle interaction between environmental rhythmicity (most notably in photoperiod and temperature) and cultural adaption. There is intriguing evidence that human gonadotrophic activity (and hence fertility) may be affected by seasonal fluctuations in light intensity and duration. Nevertheless, cultural factors are important insofar as they mediate between environmental rhythmicity and human fertility/birth patterns. This article examines the distribution of births over several decades in an Inuit community located 300 miles north of the Arctic Circle. Several shifts in birth seasonality are noted, the most significant of which is a dramatic shift from pronounced seasonality in the 1970s to non-seasonality in the 1980s. Longitudinal ethnographic fieldwork has allowed an examination of social and economic changes accounting for the rather sudden disappearance of birth seasonality. These include increasing reliance upon wage employment and social assistance, decreased dependence upon subsistence hunting and trapping, changing attitudes on the part of young people entering their prime reproductive years, and the introduction of television, radio, and southern-style recreational activities.																	0300-7839	1572-9915				SEP	1991	19	3					287	321		10.1007/BF00888980								WOS:A1991KA65700001	12345165

Diapause responses in Nanda-Hamner experiments indicate that circadian rhythmicity is involved in photoperiodic time measurement (PPTM). However, although the locomotor rhythm shows long-lasting changes in free-running period (aftereffects of photoperiod and constant light) and occasional "splitting," thereby indicating a structural complexity to the circadian system, the overt rhythm may be used as an indicator of phase relationships (or "hands") of the covert system involved in PPTM, within the framework of a simple external-coincidence model for the diapause clock. Thus, in light-dark (LD) cycles close to "resonance" with the circadian pacemaker(s) (T 24, LD 12:12; T 48, LD 12:36; and T 72, LD 12:60), light is restricted to the subjective day and diapause incidence is high. In T 36 (LD 12:24) and T 60 (LD 12:48), light falls into the subjective night and illuminates the postulated light-sensitive phase (phi-i), and diapause incidence is low. Within the primary range of entrainment, light invades the late subjective night in T 20 (LD 12:8), illuminates phi-i, and causes low incidence of diapause; however, it invades the early subjective night in T 30 (LD 12:18) and diapause remains high.																	0748-7304					FAL	1991	6	3					217	233		10.1177/074873049100600303								WOS:A1991GE80800003	1773093

Treatments were grass hay alone (C), C plus cottonseed meal, C plus mountain mahogany, and C plus mountain mahogany and cottonseed meal. All supplements provided 42 g of supplemental crude protein per head daily. Treatments were assigned to wethers within blocks according to a randomized complete block design. Supplemental N increased (P < 0.01) N digestibility and balance regardless of source; however, lambs supplemented with mountain mahogany digested less (P < 0.01) N, but their N balance did not differ (P < 0.10) from those supplemented with cottonseed meal. Wethers supplemented with mountain mahogany plus cottonseed meal ate more (P < 0.05) organic matter (OM) than the average consumed by those given either of the 2 supplements alone. Protein supplementation did not affect (P > 0.05) OM or fiber digestibility. Range management practices that encourage dormant season utilization of mountain mahogany by ruminants in the Southwest could reduce supplemental protein needs; such practices might include reserving mountain mahogany sites for winter use as well as greater use of mountain mahogany (and other palatable, highly nutritive shrubs) in range restoration programs in mountainous areas.																	0022-409X					SEP	1991	44	5					497	500		10.2307/4002752								WOS:A1991GF82000017						
J	YODER, JA; DENLINGER, DL				YODER, JA; DENLINGER, DL			A COMPARISON OF THE WATER-BALANCE CHARACTERISTICS OF TEMPERATE AND TROPICAL FLY PUPAE	PHYSIOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												Water balance characteristics of temperate zone fly pupae are compared with the characteristics of flies inhabiting the tropics. The flies, all of which were reared without diapause, had very similar equilibrium weights that were quite high (a(v) 0.90-0.92), thus implying a limited capacity to absorb water from a subsaturated atmosphere. Likewise, the critical transition temperatures (CTT) were nearly the same for all the flies. Net transpiration rates at 20-degrees-C are a function of size, but the rate is less size dependent as temperature increases. When water loss is examined across a broad temperature range, as described by activation energies, it is apparent that the tropical flies lose water at a greater rate than their temperate zone counterparts. Activation energy may be a good parameter to use in evaluating habitat preference and suitability for a species because it describes water loss as a function of temperature, and thus is likely to be a good indicator of the insect's response to the fluctuating temperatures that occur naturally.																	0307-6962					SEP	1991	16	3					375	380		10.1111/j.1365-3032.1991.tb00575.x								WOS:A1991GD24900011						
J	SORENSON, JC				SORENSON, JC			ON THE RELATIONSHIP OF PHENOLOGICAL STRATEGY TO ECOLOGICAL SUCCESS - THE CASE OF BROOMSEDGE IN HAWAII	VEGETATIO												Andropogon virginicus L. (broomsedge) is a perennial bunchgrass of temperate origin which was introduced to the Hawaiian Islands early in the 20th Century. Since its introduction broomsedge has become the dominant species of savanna vegetation on the windward sides of Oahu and Hawaii (the Big Island). Despite its ecological success, the phenology of broomsedge - especially the timing of its periods of active growth in the summer and dormancy (or semi-rest) in the winter - is not synchronized with the summer-dry, winter-wet moisture seasonality of its range in Hawaii. Rather, this species responds to a shortening-daylength cue by flowering in late autumn, and the onset of dormancy and the progression of subsequent phenophases seems to be mostly under endogenous control following the flowering response. The lack of synchronization between the onset of active growth by broomsedge and the onset of the rainy season does not conform to the specific assumption that the ecological dominance of the perennial bunchgrass life-form in savanna vegetation results from a coupling of phenological strategy to moisture seasonality. It also brings into question the more general assumption that a perfect coupling of phenology to the prevailing climatic conditions is a prerequisite for ecological success.																	0042-3106					SEP	1991	95	2					137	147										WOS:A1991GR34500004

The nymphal duration did not vary with photoperiod in a range from 11L-13D to 15L-9D at 25-degrees-C. Adults took about 25 days to start ovipositing in long day conditions (14L-10D and 15L-9D) and more than 60 days in short day conditions (11L-13D) to 13L-11D). The adult stage immediately after emergence was the most sensitive to photoperiod, and the pre-oviposition period was also influenced by the photoperiod experienced during the nymphal stage. Female adults transferred from a short day to a long day laid eggs without delay. It seems that the adults of the 1st generation, having grown under long day conditions, avert diapause, while those of the 2nd generation, having experienced short day conditions, enter diapause. Thus, it is likely that E. pallidus has a heterodynamic life cycle controlled by photoperiod in the subtropical region.																	0003-6862	1347-605X				AUG	1991	26	3					347	355		10.1303/aez.26.347								WOS:A1991GD14500010

Incidences of diapause varied among populations under 14.5L-9.5D at 20-degrees-C. Estimates of critical photoperiods fell between 14 hr 23 min and 14 hr 43 min. Those for the northern populations were not critically different from the original population which initially colonized. However, those for the southern trivoltine populations were shorter than those for the northern bivoltine ones. The critical photoperiods were nearly the same within each voltinism region. The period for larvae not destined to diapause was generally shorter than the one for diapause-destined larvae. This tendency was more conspicuous in the trivoltine populations. The non-diapause-destined larval and pupal periods in the trivoltine Kobe population were shorter than those in the bivoltine ones under 16L-8D at 20-degrees-C. Under 14L-10D at 20-degrees-C, however, the diapause-destined larval period in the Kobe population was not different from the larval periods in all but one bivoltine population. Voltinism, critical photoperiod for diapause induction and developmental period of this species have changed during its 40-year colonization of Japan.																	0003-6862					AUG	1991	26	3					357	363		10.1303/aez.26.357								WOS:A1991GD14500011

The birth timing of P. v. vitulina was not related to latitude, but birthing in P. v. concolor along eastern North America exhibited a latitudinal cline. The timing of birth in P. v. richardsi varied in three distinct patterns: (1) a significant unidirectional latitudinal cline extending between Baja California and the west coast of Washington; (2) a cluster comprised of Puget Sound, Washington and Vancouver Island, British Columbia colonies in which birthing occurred an average of 65 days later than on the Washington coast; and (3) a cluster from northern British Columbia and Alaska which did not demonstrate a latitudinal cline. Insufficient data were available for the analysis of P. v. mellonae or P. v. stejnegeri. We found great regional variation in the timing of birth among all colonies, with mean birth dates occurring as early as 15 March and as late as 3 September. Little variation existed north of 50-degrees. To the south of 50-degrees, however, most of the variation could be attributed to correlation with latitude or to affiliation with the Puget Sound, Washington-Vancouver Island, British Columbia geographic area. Clinal variation in pupping could result from: (1) geographic variations in a selective factor with perhaps gene exchange between contiguous populations playing a role in smoothing the variation; or (2) for populations between Mexico and the west coast of Washington, regional variation in a non-selective environmental variable, such as photoperiod.

The response was greatest in young plants at low temperatures. The leaf area ratio (LAR) increased by about 50% which more than compensated for a reduction in net assimilation rate (NAR) by about 20%. The effect of daylength extension on RGR was similar for an arctic ecotype of P. alpina from Svalbard, an alpine ecotype from southern Norway and a boreal-temperature ecotype from southern Norway. The main changes in the growth parameters occurred over the 13 to 17 h photoperiod range in P. alpina from both Svalbard and Rondane, although plants at Svalbard are exposed to midnight sun throughout their growing season. The ecotype of P. alpina from southern Norway had fewer tillers and allocated less dry matter to the roots than the two other ecotypes.																	0105-9327					JUL-SEP	1991	14	3					161	168										WOS:A1991GH21300001

J	DRINKWATER, LE; CROWE, JH				DRINKWATER, LE; CROWE, JH			HYDRATION STATE, METABOLISM, AND HATCHING OF MONO LAKE ARTEMIA CYSTS	BIOLOGICAL BULLETIN												Artemia monica, the only macrozooplankton in Mono Lake, California, is unique among brine shrimp in that it produces encysted diapause embryos that sink to the lake bottom where they overwinter. Currently, the lake's salinity is about twice as high as it was 40 years ago and, at equilibrium, it is projected to fluctuate between 169-248 g/l. Here we describe the effects of salinity on the termination of diapause, hatching, carbohydrate metabolism, and hydration of the cysts. As expected, hatching is much more sensitive to salinity than is termination of diapause. Carbohydrate metabolism, which involves the conversion of trehalose to glycerol and is required for hatching, responds to increasing salinity as reported in other Artemia species: increasing amounts of glycerol must be synthesized as salinity is raised. The unfreezable water in these embryos is 0.29 g H2O/gram dry weight (gdw) cysts, similar to values reported for other biological systems. This result and previous studies suggest that water probably becomes limiting at hydration levels of about 0.60 g H2O/gdw cysts. In Mono Lake water, the cysts reach this critical hydration at a salinity between 140-160 g/l, equivalent to approximately 3780-4330 mOsm/kg. We conclude that Artemia monica will cease to exist within this salinity range and doubt that it can hatch beyond this limit, which is imposed by the requirement of metabolic processes for minimal amounts of cellular water.																	0006-3185					JUN	1991	180	3					432	439		10.2307/1542343								WOS:A1991FQ68500010	29304650					
J	WELLSO, SG				WELLSO, SG			ESTIVATION AND PHENOLOGY OF THE HESSIAN FLY (DIPTERA, CECIDOMYIIDAE) IN INDIANA	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												In the northern part of its range in North America, the Hessian fly, Mayetiola destructor (Say), has one generation each year and overwinters in diapause. In the southern part of its range, it may have six generations each year, and does not overwinter in diapause; however, its summer development is interrupted by an aestival period. Between these two extremes, the number of generations varies with geographical location and prevailing climatic conditions, and the species usually diapauses and aestivates each year. Laboratory aestivation can be induced by high temperatures (daily thermocycles ranging from 17 to 36-degrees-C), and terminated by exposure to four or more consecutive days at 21.1-degrees-C. Diapause was terminated at 21.1-degrees-C in about the same number of days of exposure to daylengths of 8:16 or 16:8 (L:D), suggesting that photoperiod is less important than temperature. Extremely high Indiana temperatures during the summer of 1988 induced a more intense aestivation, and its termination was delayed in the field. Many eggs were laid on wheat that fall after the Hessian-fly-free date, and a very mild winter followed, resulting in the largest spring fly infestation recorded in the last 24 yr. A large percentage of aestival puparia submerged under water for weekly intervals up to seven weeks delayed pupating by the duration of time that they were submerged, suggesting that a higher titer of oxygen might be necessary to break aestivation.																	0046-225X					JUN	1991	20	3					795	801		10.1093/ee/20.3.795								WOS:A1991FT88800008

J	OKLAND, B				OKLAND, B			LABORATORY STUDIES OF EGG DEVELOPMENT AND DIAPAUSE IN ISOPERLA-OBSCURA (PLECOPTERA) FROM A MOUNTAIN STREAM IN NORWAY	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. A laboratory study of egg development of the stonefly Isoperla obscura (Zetterstedt) collected from the stream Flybekken (southern Norway, 61-degrees-25'N, 8-degrees-48'E, 1373 m a.s.l.) showed a short diapause followed by a prolonged period of postdiapause quiescence. 2. Diapause occurred over a wide range of temperatures (-20-degrees-C to +8-degrees-C), but 0-1-degrees-C was the most favourable for fast diapause development and successful hatching. Diapause development required temperatures below 12-degrees-C, but sub-zero diapause temperatures increased mortality during the postdiapause phase, as well as reducing hatching success. 3. The threshold for initiation of postdiapausal development was about 1-2-degrees-C. Development rate increased and variation in development time decreased at higher water temperatures. These may be important characteristics to ensure seasonal and geographical synchrony of development in individual populations. Low postdiapausal temperatures were unfavourable, despite a subsequent increase in water temperature. No response to postdiapausal photoperiod was detected. 4. The results agreed well with conditions noted in the natural environment, and with the abundance of this species at high altitudes and latitudes in Fennoscandia. Nevertheless, Isoperla obscura also occurs in streams in the maritime parts of western Norway. The results of the present study suggest that egg development in these populations will prove to be different.

After birds had gone through a reproductive cycle and postnuptial moult they developed migratory restlessness in autumn. At this time one group was transferred back to the previous wintering site (Pisa) where birds were held in individual activity cages in an outdoor aviary, allowing them to perceive as much environmental information as possible. A second group was transferred to a control site near Tour du Valat/France of approximately the same latitude and climate, but different longitude and held in an identical aviary. The diurnal activity pattern changed after transfer back to the previous wintering site, but not after transfer to the control site. Specifically, the amount of morning activity was reduced while afternoon activity was increased. This effect was restricted to those individuals that had been developing nocturnal migratory restlessness the previous spring. It was absent in individuals without migratory restlessness in spring, indicating that the different patterns were not due to unspecific effects from the testing sites. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that birds were able to derive information about their locality and to recognize their previous wintering site, resulting in suppression of migratory state by experience. The results are not definitely conclusive, however, because of several difficulties in the interpretation of perch-hopping activity, which are discussed in detail.																	0179-1613					MAY	1991	88	1					35	45										WOS:A1991FU50700004

Trial 1 was conducted on mature green irrigated tall wheatgrass (Elytrigia pontica [Podp.] Holub) pasture during September. Trial 2 was conducted on dormant native range during December. Fecal output was determined by total fecal collection (TFC) and the CRD for each steer. Fecal output estimates from the CRD were based on a chromium release rate (980 mg/day) provided by the manufacturer. Estimates of daily fecal dry matter output (kg) in trial 1 were 2.70 and 2.69, and in trial 2 were 3.19 and 2.89 from the TFC and CRD, respectively. Differences between TFC and CRD were not significant in trial 1 (P = 0.59) but were significant in trial 2 (P < 0.01). When averaged over days and animals, estimates of daily fecal dry matter from CRD were within 1% of TFC in trial 1 and 10% of TFC in trial 2. Estimates of daily fecal dry matter from CRD were influenced by sampling day and steer (P < 0.01); however, there was no consistent pattern to day or animal variation. Multiple days and animals are required for both TFC and CRD. We conclude that CRD provides an acceptable estimate of daily fecal output. However, to improve accuracy, TFC can be used on a subsample of animals as a double sampling technique to adjust estimates derived from CRD.

They probably achieve this by migration to a specific, daytime isolume. Photoperiod information provided by light intensity at depth could serve as a cue for termination of the resting phase. Population data on tooth formation and gonad growth show that the resting stock prepares for termination in late winter and matures in February-March. Photoperiods are lengthening throughout that seasonal interval, and might cue arousal. An endogenous, 'long-range' timer that cues arousal after an interval of rest is another possible mechanism.																	0171-8630					MAY	1991	72	1-2					79	91		10.3354/meps072079								WOS:A1991FP59800008

There was distinct seasonality with most dependent variables. Feeding rate was highest in summer and varied positively with day length and daily maximum temperature. Number of workers was highest in summer, increased with increasing day length but leveled off at higher values of day length. Mass of individual workers was fairly uniform but tended to be higher in summer; it varied positively with temperature but leveled off at higher temperatures. Percentage of soldiers was highest in early winter and varied inversely with day length and temperature. On average, these colonies ate 7265.2 +/- 1653.3 g (range = 4647.1 g to 9969.9 g) of pine (Pinus sp.) wood in baits over 2 yr.																	0003-0031	1938-4238				APR	1991	125	2					222	230		10.2307/2426226								WOS:A1991FP08800007

Habitat selection in the laboratory at low temperatures was similar to hibernating habitat in the field. Habitat preference tests were conducted in warm (15 C) and near-freezing (1.5 C) air temperatures. Rana pipiens shows no preference for either water or land at 15 C, but prefers water to land at 1.5 C. When given a choice between bare moist soil or moist soil covered by leaf litter, R. pipiens remains on the uncovered surface in both warm and cold conditions. Rana sylvatica prefers land to water at both 15 C and 1.5 C. At 1.5 C R. sylvatica burrows into soil and seeks cover beneath leaf litter; it also selects moist soil rather than wet mud during exposure to cold. Rana sylvatica can survive prolonged submergence in ice-covered water. Physiological adaptations such as cryoprotectants and the geographic distribution of R. sylvatica are discussed in relation to habitat selection at low temperatures.																	0003-0031					APR	1991	125	2					259	268										WOS:A1991FP08800011

At least 29 mayfly species were recorded from the streams, with 16 common enough for life history analysis. Mayfly distribution and diversity were correlated with pH regime and stream size. No mayflies were found in the smallest, most acid stream, and numbers of mayfly species and their relative abundances generally increased with both increasing stream size and stream pH. Incorporation of life cycle information with distributional data enabled us to determine the precise stream-water pH range encountered by different mayfly life stages in the study streams. Generally, during the period of greatest acid stress in the streams (pH depressions associated with spring snowmelt) the mayflies were present in large or dormant stages, which are believed to be more tolerant of lowered pH.																	0008-4301					APR	1991	69	4					899	910		10.1139/z91-135								WOS:A1991FP79800012

We studied species composition, abundance and population dynamics of cyclopoid copepods emerging from dormancy from the sediments of a temporary pond in South Carolina in 1985, 1988 and 1989. During a drought in 1988-89, the maximum hydroperiod was 19 days; in 1985 and late 1989-early 1990, the hydroperiods were 57 and 118 days. We also report on species present in 1984 and 1987, two years that had longer hydroperiods, and on abundance of cyclopoids in 1984. 2. Within a day after standing water appeared, fourth-instar copepodids of Diacyclops haueri and D. crassicaudis brachycercus became active. These two species appeared every time the pond filled in winter, spring, or autumn. Other species, including Acanthocyclops vernalis, were usually not collected until weeks or months after the pond filled. Because the times and durations of fillings were extremely variable, species composition differed among years, with the most species (eleven) appearing in 1984, the year with the longest hydroperiod. 3. The abundances of emerging Diacyclops were much lower in 1988 and 1989 (range of means from seven fillings in spring and autumn: 675-7382 animals m-2) than 1985 (range of means from three fillings in winter: 26,037-107,418 animals m-2). Low abundances of emerging animals could have been caused by poor survival of dormant animals, poor production during preceding seasons, or incomplete emergence of the dormant populations. 4. Substrate samples from the dry pond were collected in spring, summer, and autumn 1988 and winter 1989 to measure emergence of the cyclopoids in laboratory incubations. Population densities of emerging animals were much lower in 1988 and 1989 (range of means from seven experiments: 0-120 animals m-2 over the first 3 days) than in similar experiments in 1984 (Taylor & Mahoney, 1990, means from two experiments: 3630 and 6890 animals m-2). 5. Despite the low abundance of animals emerging from dormancy in late 1989, the cyclopoid populations in 1990 reached similar densities of copepodids (10(4)-10(5) animals m-2) to those reached in 1984 and 1985. These results suggest that short generation time and high reproductive capacity permit rapid recovery from population reductions.																	0046-5070					APR	1991	25	2					219	232		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1991.tb00487.x								WOS:A1991FR30400004

The threshold was estimated to be 3.2-degrees-C by extrapolation of the regression of developmental rate on temperature, a figure confirmed by calculation of the minimum total degree day variation over a range of hypothetical thresholds. Degree day requirements for median eclosion for cohorts of eggs collected at intervals through the winter were used to indicate the approximate date of diapause termination (February 1 in western Oregon), and indicated the need for chilling requirements to be met during diapause development.																	0931-2048					APR	1991	111	4					391	396		10.1111/j.1439-0418.1991.tb00339.x								WOS:A1991FL97100010

Application of the sterile insect technique (SIT) to the facefly, Musca autumnalis DeGeer, is considered. 2. Six-day-old pupae were exposed to ionizing irradiation at doses in the range 100-1600 rads, each treatment being replicated six times. 3. Eclosion was unaffected but fecundity and fertility was inversely proportional to the radiation dose. 4. 1600 rads gave 97% dominant lethality of sperm in treated males and suppressed ovarian development in females. Irradiated flies did not recover fertility. 5. Irradiation of males and females did not affect insemination rates. 6. Sterile males showed a decline in longevity and reduced mating competitiveness. 7. Local eradication of M.autumnalis is considered to be feasible if sufficient diapausing sterile flies are stockpiled and released in early spring, followed by additional releases of non-diapausing flies in late spring and early summer, with further releases of diapausing sterile flies in late summer and autumn.																	0269-283X					APR	1991	5	2					175	181		10.1111/j.1365-2915.1991.tb00538.x								WOS:A1991FT12700004	1768911					
J	HAGAN, JM; LLOYDEVANS, TL; ATWOOD, JL				HAGAN, JM; LLOYDEVANS, TL; ATWOOD, JL			THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LATITUDE AND THE TIMING OF SPRING MIGRATION OF NORTH-AMERICAN LANDBIRDS	ORNIS SCANDINAVICA												Under laboratory conditions, two mechanisms have been identified that control the onset of migration. One mechanism inflexibly controls the initiation of migration, while the other requires external input from a changing environment. It has been suggested that the evolution of these mechanisms has an ecological basis related to the wintering latitude of the species. To establish whether the timing of migration was consistent with this ecological explanation, we studied the long-term mean timing of spring migration, and within-year and among-year variance in timing, in 27 free-living Nearctic migrant species. Species that wintered in higher, temperate latitudes migrated significantly earlier than tropical-wintering species. Tropical-wintering species showed significantly less within-year and among-year variation in the timing of migration, suggesting that the mechanism regulating their migration is primarily endogenous, with little influence of external stimuli. In contrast, breeding latitude showed no relationship to the mean date of migration, or the within-year or among-year variation in timing. These results are consistent with the notion that conditions that indicate time-of-year are unreliable or change imperceptibly (photoperiod) in the tropics, making an endogenous circannual clock valuable for controlling the onset and progression of migration. Temperate-wintering species were more likely to show interspecific correlations in timing than tropical species, further suggesting that external cues modulate spring migration in temperate-wintering species. Our results indicate that the migration regulation system employed might be ultimately determined by wintering latitude and associated environmental cues.																	0030-5693					APR-JUN	1991	22	2					129	136		10.2307/3676543								WOS:A1991FW19900007

The oak treehopper Platycotis vittata (Fabricius) is bivoltine throughout its range with discrete generations in the early spring and autumn. Females of both generations diapause. 2. Latitudinal variation in the timing of life history exists among four populations of P. vittata along the eastern coastal plain of the United States. 3. We disrupted synchronization between P. vittata life history and host-plant phenology in the springs of 1984 and 1985 by placing southern populations on northern trees with a different phenology. This caused some females to oviposit abnormally in late spring, without entering diapause. The offspring of these females had reduced reproductive success. 4. Winter diapause can be broken by providing females with a newly flushing tree with high levels of amino nitrogen in the sap. Females terminated winter diapause on trees breaking winter dormancy while females on trees still in winter dormancy did not, under identical photoperiod and temperature regimes. 5. The role of host-plant mediated life history variation as a process promoting intraspecific geographic differentiation in the arboreal sapfeeding guild is discussed.																	0307-6946					FEB	1991	16	1					63	72		10.1111/j.1365-2311.1991.tb00193.x								WOS:A1991ET42600008

Reciprocal crosses produced viable offspring. However, the number of eggs produced by A. fasciatus (female) x A. socius (male) was significantly smaller than that by the reciprocal cross or intraspecific crosses; the hatchability was < 10 %, whereas most eggs produced in the other crosses overwintered and hatched. In the laboratory, development time for the male hybrids produced by A. socius (female) x A. fasciatus (male) was similar to that of their mothers rather than fathers, but the hybrid females were intermediate between the parent species, suggesting that nymphal development is primarily controlled by the X chromosome. The two species and their hybrids showed different ranges of embryonic stages for water absorption and diapause. Crickets collected from different localities in eastern North America were identified to species by their different diapause stages. The results were consistent with others' observations that the two species meet at around 38-39-degrees-N where hybrids occur. The geographic profiles and the possible isolating mechanisms between the two species are discussed.																	0013-8746					JAN	1991	84	1					29	36		10.1093/aesa/84.1.29								WOS:A1991ET96400003						
J	MURRAY, AM; GILLER, PS				MURRAY, AM; GILLER, PS			LIFE-HISTORY AND OVERWINTERING TACTICS OF VELIA-CAPRAI TAM (HEMIPTERA, VELIIDAE) IN SOUTHERN IRELAND	AQUATIC INSECTS												Velia caprai Tamanini (Hemiptera: Veliidae) is predominantly a stream dweller, and has been considered univoltine in the British Isles, with adults overwintering in a reproductively immature state. This study reveals a far more complex life-cycle. Dissections of females captured between October 1986 and March 1987 revealed that while 17% of individuals had deposits of adipose tissue and showed no reproductive development (diapause individuals), the majority of females examined (83%) revealed mature ovaries. This presence of a non-diapause overwintering subpopulation of reproductively mature females has not been previously recorded for this species. The absence of adipose tissue in these latter females, plus the presence of obviously full guts in 24% of cases - indicating very recent feeding - supports this non-diapause overwintering. Sampling also revealed that fifth instar larvae overwintered and these comprised 2.3% of all individuals (excluding first instar larvae) captured between November 1986 and March 1987. Three different overwintering tactics were therefore identified with early spring populations therefore consisting of mature egg-bearing females, immature females and some fifth instar larvae. Information from less complete data of spring 1986 confirmed that the variation in the overwintering status of females in 1987 was not a once-off response to unusual climatic conditions. This distinct within-population temporal variability in the attainment of reproductive maturity by the females of Velia caprai extended the reproductive season of the species, and may help buffer populations from being overly affected by adverse weather conditions during the late autumn and early spring months. First instar larvae were encountered in the field by mid-March - two months earlier than previous records. New-generation adults were subsequently captured in mid-June, and there is indirect evidence to suggest a partial second generation may sometimes occur under suitable circumstances. Growth experiments over a range of temperatures indicated faster development at the higher temperatures, although a reduced survival rate at temperatures above 20-degrees-C was noted.																	0165-0424						1991	13	4					229	243		10.1080/01650429109361450								WOS:A1991HD28900006

Results were then used to evaluate potential emissions under doubled-CO2 climate scenarios. Current emissions were estimated on the basis of vegetation type, foliar biomass (derived from the satellite-generated Global Vegetation index), and global databases for air temperature and photoperiod. The model had a monthly time step and the spatial resolution was 0.5 degrees latitude and longitude. Emissions under patterns of precipitation and temperature projected for a doubling of atmospheric CO2 were estimated based on predicted changes in the areal extent of different vegetation types, each having a specific rate of annual isoprene emissions. The global total for current emissions was 285 Tg. The calculated isoprene emissions under a doubled-CO2 climate were about 25% higher than current emissions due mainly to the expansion of tropical humid forests which had the highest annual emission rates. An increase in isoprene emissions would be likely to increase atmospheric concentrations of ozone and methane, which are important greenhouse gases, and thus act as a positive feedback to global warming. Detailed treatment of this question, however, will require incorporation of these emission surfaces into global atmospheric chemistry models.

THE EFFECT OF INHIBITORS OF PROTEIN-SYNTHESIS ON RECOVERY, GROWTH AND PHARYNGEAL PUMPING	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMISTRY & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY												1. The requirement for protein synthesis in the recovery process of the dauer larva of Caenorhabditis elegans was investigated using several protein synthesis inhibitors. 2. Cycloheximide retarded and inhibited the onset of pharyngeal pumping and the onset of SDS sensitivity in dauer larvae placed in fresh medium. It also affected longitudinal growth in recovering larvae. 3. Anisomycin had similar effects to cycloheximide. Puromycin and oxytetracycline also affected longitudinal growth, but they had a milder effect on dauer larva recovery. 4. Both cycloheximide and puromycin inhibited the incorporation of [S-35]methionine into protein in recovering dauer larvae, cycloheximide being the more effective drug. 5. Measurement of peptidyl transferse activity suggested that a rapid burst of protein synthesis occurs before the onset of pharyngeal pumping in recovering dauer larvae. 6. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed the retention of dauer specific protein bands when 10 mM cycloheximide was present in the recovery medium, indicating that recovery is prevented by the drug. 7. Since protein synthesis, but not mRNA synthesis appears to be obligatory for dauer larva recovery, the dauer larva may represent a developmental state analogous to unfertilized oocytes or to diapausing insect embryos which contain mRNA stores which are translated when stimulated by a suitable activating trigger.																	0305-0491						1991	98	2-3					245	252		10.1016/0305-0491(91)90174-C								WOS:A1991FD21600010						
J	BROWN, JS; VENABLE, DL				BROWN, JS; VENABLE, DL			LIFE-HISTORY EVOLUTION OF SEED-BANK ANNUALS IN RESPONSE TO SEED PREDATION	EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY												We present a model of life history evolution for seed-bank annuals in temporally varying environments in which both the seed bank and the distribution of fecundity across year types evolve in response to seed predation. The fecundity distribution refers to the expected reproductive success of germinating seeds across a range of different year types. We assume that it is a function of traits pertaining to growth and survival under different environmental circumstances. Such traits are assumed to result in a trade-off between reproduction in favourable and less favourable years. The model is used to explore how seed predation selects for changes in the seed bank and fecundity distribution and how changes in each of these further select for changes in the other. The direction of selection is contingent upon: whether or not a seed bank exists; whether predation has a greater effect on fresh or buried seed; whether the predation rate differs in different year types, and if so, if it is positively or negatively density-dependent; whether or not predation rate is sensitive to individual variation in seed yield, and if so, whether and how such dependency varies in different kinds of year. Under a variety of predation regimes, seed predators select for a temporal clumping of reproduction; i.e. a specialisation on a favourable subset of year types. This effect usually requires negatively density-dependent seed predation of the sort created by predator satiation. In fact, the classic scenario favouring masting in perennials creates the strongest such effect in our model. Yet unlike the masting of perennial plants, this effect is favoured in a seed-bank annual. It can even occur in a strict annual without a seed bank, and it can occur in a seed-bank annual even if seed predation is density-independent.

The fertility level of the El Salvador population exceeded that of the Maryland population under both diapause and non-diapause conditions. Changes in photoperiod had a greater impact on diapause in the El Salvador population, while the Maryland strain was more responsive to changes in temperature. Progeny of reciprocal crosses were more fertile than progeny of purebred crosses, suggesting hybrid vigor. Results indicated that in the Mexican bean beetle reproductive diapause is genetically inherited, has some degree of dominance, and that population differences due to temperature and photoperiod are probably adaptations to the specific population environments.																	0749-8004					JAN	1991	26	1					109	121		10.18474/0749-8004-26.1.109								WOS:A1991FB27100016

This species is capable of measuring the length of the scotophase of each natural light-dark cycle within a dark range of 13-5 h. Changes of the scotophase in the conventional "short-day range" as well as the "long-day range" correlate with changes in the proportion of diapausing individuals. Longer scotophases generally have a stronger diapause inducing effect than shorter ones. This is clearly demonstrated by shortening the scotophase a mere 5 min. Additionally, a concept of time measurement based on Gibbs' model is discussed. It is postulated that the different inductive strengths of various scotophases are dependent on the syntheses of different amounts of an "unknown substance". The inductive strength is influenced by temperature. The substance synthesized is accumulated daily and added up to an "induction sum". A photoperiodic response is induced if an innate threshold of the "induction sum" is exceeded. The adaptive significance of a quantitative measurement of photoperiodic events is seen in the ability of a more flexible response to actual environmental conditions in individuals of migrating species like P. brassicae.																	0022-1910						1991	37	3					231	238		10.1016/0022-1910(91)90073-9								WOS:A1991FG56000007						
J	POUND, JM; GEORGE, JE				POUND, JM; GEORGE, JE			DIFFERENTIAL-EFFECTS OF PHOTOPERIOD ON DEVELOPMENT AND REPRODUCTION IN MONTANE AND PRAIRIE STRAINS OF THE ROCKY-MOUNTAIN WOOD TICK (ACARI, IXODIDAE)	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY												Progeny of Dermacentor andersoni Stiles adults collected from one "montane" and two "prairie" sites in southern Alberta, Canada, were exposed to combinations of 9:15, 11:13 and 13:11 (L:D) daily photoperiods during various stages of their life cycle. Time required for developmental and reproductive events was recorded. Significant differences in mean molting times of fed larvae were observed, yet the differences were small, and mean times were not attributed to photoperiodic regime. Fed nymphal "prairie" ticks had significantly longer developmental rates under decreasing light regimes than in constant or increasing regimes, while "montane" ticks showed no differential response to any of these regimes. Engorged "montane" females in all regimes weighed significantly more than those in either "prairie" strain, and "prairie" strain females in increasing and constant short-day regimes were significantly heavier than those in decreasing and constant long-day regimes. Photoperiod is unimportant in the regulation of fed-larval development, and the magnitude of female engorgement may be nominally favored by short-day and increasing regimes. The differential phenotypic expression of photoperiodic regulation of fed nymphal development in this tick may have resulted from selective pressures involving differences in host availability and moisture conditions in the two geographic regions.																	0022-2585					JAN	1991	28	1					174	182		10.1093/jmedent/28.1.174								WOS:A1991EQ85600028	2033610

J	GAMBINO, P				GAMBINO, P			REPRODUCTIVE PLASTICITY OF VESPULA-PENSYLVANICA (HYMENOPTERA, VESPIDAE) ON MAUI AND HAWAII ISLANDS, USA	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Reproductive activities of Vespula pensylvanica (Saussure) were studied on the recently invaded (1978) islands of Maui and Hawaii. Aspects of reproductive behaviour were inferred from the use of attractant traps to monitor foraging worker and queen populations, observations of architecture and traffic rates of nests, and dissections of queens occupying active nests or captured while foraging. Most wasp colonies adhered to the basic annual cycle dominant throughout V. pensylvanica's native temperate range. Atypical overwintering colonies, indicated by at least one episode of large cell construction and a subsequent reversion to small cell construction, occurred on both islands, but were detected in only some years. Overwintered colonies had peak traffic rates in excess of 300 worker sorties per minute, but some large annual colonies also had traffic rates greater than 300 per minute. Flying queens were most abundant during the spring (March-June), but were captured in every month except January. Among autumn queens taken from nests on Hawaii, oviposition-ready queens were more common than hibernation-ready queens, suggesting that winter hibernation is not obligatory. Polygyny, achieved by adding queens to an established colony, is a likely prerequisite for successful colony overwintering. Two gyne-addition mechanisms are proposed for this: retention of daughter queens, and joining by outside queens. Expression of V. pensylvanica reproductive plasticity is correlated with relaxation of climate-related constraints. Relaxation of genetic constraints is also hypothesised to contribute to the emergence of polygyny in Hawaiian Island populations.																	0301-4223						1991	18	2					139	149		10.1080/03014223.1991.10757960								WOS:A1991FW42600008

While diverse larval detoxication abilities are known for both Papilio glaucus and the closely related P. canadensis, the factors affecting oviposition preferences in adult females are unknown. These congeneric species were studied to determine the extent of oviposition mistakes on toxic plants. We were also interested in comparing the geographic patterns of variation in oviposition preferences and the genetic basis of these differences. We conducted oviposition three-choice studies with the Canadian tiger swallowtail butterfly, Papilio canadensis, and the Eastern tiger swallowtail, Papilio glaucus, giving them the choice of (1) tuliptree, Liriodendron tulipifera, which is toxic to virtually all populations (P. canadensis) north of the Great Lakes Region of North America, (2) quaking aspen, Populus tremuloides, which is toxic to essentially all populations (P. glaucus) south of the Great Lakes, and (3) black cherry, Prunus serotina, which is an excellent foodplant for all members of the Papilio glaucus group, but which does not occur at latitudinal extremes of North America (in Alaska and most of Canada or the southern half of Florida). Handpaired interspecific hybrids were tested under the same experimental design to evaluate the possibility of sexlinked oviposition behavior. There was considerable variability in the choice of plants by individual butterflies, but a general trend suggesting that the females of each species had a lower preference for the plant toxic to their larvae. More than 6000 oviposition bouts were counted from 37 different P. canadensis and 54 P. glaucus females along a latitudinal transect of approximately 5000 km from Alaska south through the Great Lakes hybrid zone region to southern Florida. While not exceptionally high anywhere, the preference for aspen (Salicaceae) declined precipitously in central Michigan (45-degrees-N latitude) and remained very low (5-12%) in all locations southward to Florida, whereas we observed a reciprocal trend in preference for tuliptree (Magnoliaceae) which was greatest in Florida (87% of all eggs) and steadily declined northward across the Great Lakes region. Cherry was selected in these 3-choice tests at a relatively consistent and low frequency at all latitudes. Fixed allele differences in sex-linked (LDH and PGD) and autosomal (HK) electromorphs are known for P. glaucus and P. canadensis. Our electrophoretic data suggest that the preference of an individual female for aspen is not simply a characteristic of the northern species (P. canadensis) but can occur in P. glaucus females. The reciprocal situation is also evident in Northern Michigan and Wisconsin females (scored electrophoretically and morphologically as P. canadensis) which sometimes exhibit a clear preference for the toxic tuliptree. In fact, Alaskan populations of P. canadensis chose tuliptree for about 52% of their eggs, even though none of their offspring has ever survived on this plant species in laboratory studies. We conclude that even with distinctive latitudinal trends, a considerable amount of local variation in relative oviposition preference exists among individuals of these polyphagous species. Both P. glaucus and P. canadensis will lay eggs on toxic plants. It appears that factors selecting against oviposition on toxic tuliptrees have been minimal (relative to other factors) in Alaska and somewhat stronger in the Great Lakes hybrid zone. It is in this zone of contact with tuliptree where selection against the P. canadensis populations ovipositing on tuliptree may be strong due to high larval mortality when such natural "mistakes" are made. We do not know whether behavioral preference changes evolutionarily preceded or followed the development of specific physiological detoxication abilities for tuliptree or quaking aspen. However, for both P. canadensis and P. glaucus the occurrence of "oviposition mistakes" on toxic plants by adults extends geographically well beyond the larval detoxication abilities of their offspring. Hybrid female offspring of pairings with Michigan canadensis females and glaucus males show distinct preferences for tuliptree, suggesting that oviposition may be controlled by a factor (or factors) on the sex chromosome. Unfortunately we were unable to obtain reciprocal hybrids to evaluate the possibility of sex-linked aspen preference.																	0029-8549						1991	87	3					360	368		10.1007/BF00634592								WOS:A1991GA27000009	28313263					
J	NAFUS, DM; SCHREINER, IH				NAFUS, DM; SCHREINER, IH			REVIEW OF THE BIOLOGY AND CONTROL OF THE ASIAN CORN-BORER, OSTRINIA-FURNACALIS (LEP, PYRALIDAE)	TROPICAL PEST MANAGEMENT												The biology and control of the Asian corn borer, Ostrinia furnacalis Guenee, is reviewed. This insect is distributed from China to Australia and the Solomon Islands. In northern parts of its range the moths have one or a few generations per year, but in the tropics, generations are continuous and overlapping. The caterpillars can cause severe yield losses in corn, both by damage to the kernels and by feeding on the tassels, leaves, and stalks. Survival and growth of the caterpillar is highest on the reproductive parts of the plant. Other economic plants attacked include bell pepper, ginger and sorghum. Recently, the Asian corn borer appears to have become an important pest of cotton. A number of wild grasses are also used as hosts. Information on predators and parasites is summarized. Egg parasitoids are relatively effective in some tropical areas, but no significant larval or pupal parasites have been found. In temperate parts of the Asian corn borer's range, larval parasites are more abundant, having their greatest impact during the diapausing generation. A variety of techniques have been used to control the borer. Insecticides are used in many countries, but are not totally reliable. Augmentative release of egg parasitoids is widely used in China and has been tested elsewhere. Mechanical removal of the tassels can reduce borer populations 50%, and this procedure is used in the Philippines. Field corn varieties which are relatively resistant to the ACB have also been found.																	0143-6147					JAN-MAR	1991	37	1					41	56		10.1080/09670879109371535								WOS:A1991FM23200010						
J	FOLLETT, BK; PEARCEKELLY, A				FOLLETT, BK; PEARCEKELLY, A			PHOTOPERIODIC CONTROL OF THE TERMINATION OF REPRODUCTION IN JAPANESE-QUAIL (COTURNIX-COTURNIX-JAPONICA)	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Typically, birds come into breeding in the spring as a response to long days, and end reproduction some weeks later by becoming refractory to those long days. The refractory state is subsequently dissipated by the short days of autumn and winter, so producing once again a bird that can respond to long days. Bird species differ in the extent to which refractoriness is developed; the present experiments took advantage of the relative, rather than the absolute, refractoriness in quail to measure quantitatively the dissipation process. Quail were made refractory by exposure to long days, then transferred to short days and at various times thereafter photostimulated with longer daylengths, the degree of photoresponsiveness being assessed by measuring changes in luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion or cloacal gland size or both. The most clearcut results came from using 13L:11D as the test stimulus to measure photoresponsiveness, and this indicated, in both intact and castrated quail, no response to 13L:11D after one week one short days, a minor response after two weeks, a strong response after three weeks and a full response after five weeks. Thus refractoriness appears to be dissipated gradually under short days, and not in an all-or-none fashion. Confirmation of this conclusion came from experiments in which refractory quail were moved to short days and after one or two weeks transferred to a range of long daylengths. After one week of short days no responses were obtained to 13L:11 D or 14L:10D and moderate responses only to 16L:8D, but after two weeks of short days the magnitudes of all the responses were increased. Other experiments showed that the depth of refractoriness (as assessed by transferring to short days and then to 13L:11D) was dependent upon the previous duration of exposure to long days and to length of that long day. Finally, the development of refractoriness over a three month period on long days was also investigated.																	0962-8452	1471-2954				DEC 22	1990	242	1305					225	230		10.1098/rspb.1990.0128								WOS:A1990ET33600012	1983038					
J	HAGEN, RH				HAGEN, RH			POPULATION-STRUCTURE AND HOST USE IN HYBRIDIZING SUBSPECIES OF PAPILIO-GLAUCUS (LEPIDOPTERA, PAPILIONIDAE)	EVOLUTION												Two parapatric subspecies of the eastern tiger swallowtail butterfly, Papilio glaucus glaucus and P. g. canadensis, differ greatly in larval survival and growth on host plants in the Magnoliaceae, Salicaceae, and Betulaceae. In the first part of this study, butterflies were collected from 17 sites along a transect from Georgia to Quebec and used for allozyme electrophoresis. Two X- (or Z-)linked enzyme loci (Ldh and Pgd) showed allele frequency differences that delineated a hybrid zone between the subspecies in northern Pennsylvania and south-central New York. No significant linkage disequilibrium could be detected among allozyme loci within the hybrid zone samples. Genetic differentiation at Ldh and Pgd coincides with subspecies differences in diapause control and female mimicry, which are also sex-linked. Larval offspring of butterflies from 13 of the sites were then tested in the laboratory for survival and growth on Liriodendron tulipifera (Magnoliaceae), Populus deltoides (Salicaceae) and Betula lutea (Betulaceae). Steep clines in survival rates matched the position of the hybrid zone. Hybrid zone larvae showed intermediate survival rates and significant heterogeneity among families on all three plants, indicating presence of substantial genetic variation. The results suggest that differential host use by P. g. glaucus and P. g. canadensis is maintained primarily by independent clines in selection intensity for ability to use allopatric sets of host plants, coupled with restricted gene flow across the hybrid zone.																	0014-3820					DEC	1990	44	8					1914	1930		10.2307/2409603								WOS:A1990EY76900002	28564427

Moreover, the effects of temperatures on development and growth in H. flava were analysed. In the woodland, H. flava was found on vegetation throughout the year, but in the grassland no ticks were found in summer. H. longicornis disappeared from vegetation during the November-February period of hibernation. H. flava was dominant on the hares captured in winter. In H. flava, oviposition, hatching and moulting did not occur at temperatures of 15-degrees-C and below, and the developmental zero was 12.3-degrees-C. The critical low temperatures for moulting of larvae and nymphs were 14.5 and 17.0-degrees-C, respectively. High temperatures exerted a harmful influence upon oviposition and hatching. The temperature required for H. flava to be active was lower than that for H. longicornis, but the lowest temperature for development and growth in H. flava was higher than in H. longicornis, and the upper limiting temperature in the former tick was lower than in the latter: thus, it was revealed that H. flava develops and grows within a narrower range of temperatures than does H. longicornis.																	0023-6152					DEC	1990	35	1-2					17	26										WOS:A1990EP28600003						
J	DEGRAW, WA; KERN, MD				DEGRAW, WA; KERN, MD			POSTNUPTIAL MOLT IN HARRIS SPARROWS	CONDOR												We studied the postnuptial molt of captive male and female Harris' Sparrows (Zonotrichia querula) exposed to photoperiods simulating those on the breeding grounds and ambient temperatures of 22-25-degrees-C. Postnuptial molt was completed in about 82 days in individual birds. It began with the loss of P1 and concluded with replacement of contour feathers in the dorsal and ventral body tracts. Peaks of molt intensity essentially coincided in all of the major feather tracts. Intensity was highest between days 28 and 59 of molt. Primaries were replaced in the sequence normal for other passerines, but secondaries exhibited considerable deviation from the typical passerine pattern. Rectrices were often molted centrifugally, from R1 through R6, but several were dropped and replaced simultaneously. Body molt, which is described in all tracts separately, began shortly after P1 was shed and continued until the end of the molt period. Postnuptial molt is protracted and lasts considerably longer in captive Harris' Sparrows than in other North American Zonotrichia which summer either at high northern latitudes or high altitudes. The time-course of molt in Harris' Sparrows suggests that (1) periods of breeding and postnuptial molt may overlap, and (2) postnuptial molt is completed during the fall migration.																	0010-5422					NOV	1990	92	4					829	838		10.2307/1368718								WOS:A1990EP83600002

It host alternates between the primary hosts Populus nigra and P. italica and the secondary host caraway. Migration from poplar to caraway takes place from mid-June to mid-August. From year to year the number of aphids collected range from a few aphids per season to several dozen per week per yellow trap. In 1987 gall density on poplars in a caraway area was low, at most one per 20 leaves, and four yellow traps in commercial caraway fields captured a total of only 16 specimens of P. passeki. Yet these fields were successfully colonized. Since two of these fields were situated three kilometers from the nearest trees, P. passeki seems a highly efficient colonizer. The production of alatae is induced by daylength, a decrease in temperature is not necessary. Part of the population does not develop wings and hibernates in the soil. Severe winters can be survived on caraway roots. Alatae originating from caraway are sexuparae and contain embryos without functional mouthparts. One possible virgino-sexupara has been found, therefore the possibility of migration between secondary hosts cannot be excluded.																	0238-1249						1990	25	1-4					143	152										WOS:A1990FR00300016

The birch mice were caught in July 1976 (3 individuals) and in June 1988 (33 individuals) in southwest Altai near Markakol Lake (about 1800 m a.s.l.). The labelling of animals with tetracycline was carried out in 1988. Animals' age was determined by the number of layers of periosteal bone in the mandible. The dentin of incisors was studied in longitudinal ground sections and in longitudinal and cross sections stained with Ehrlich hematoxylin. Distinct daily layers in the dentin were revealed. Moreover, strongly contrasting bands were found which are believed to be formed during hibernation. The presence of these hibernation marks makes it possible to estimate the time of waking up of birch mice from hibernation. This is possible as long as the mark does not disappear in the course of growth and the wearing out of an incisor. It was speculated that males of birch mice wake up approximately two weeks before females. Methods of estimating eruption rate and the time of complete replacement of incisors are offered. The time of complete renewal of upper and lower incisors of the same individuals proved to be approximately the same. In one year for old birch mice it is significantly shorter than in older individuals (T1 = 49.6 +/- 1.17; T2 = 57.6 +/- 1.72 respectively). It is supposed that hibernation marks are formed not only in birch mice but also in other hibernating rodents.																	0001-7051						1990	35	3-4					345	356		10.4098/AT.arch.90-39								WOS:A1990GN64900018

A brief (2-h) exposure to 0-degrees-C elicits a protective response against subsequent cold injury at -10-degrees-C in the temperate flies and in B. plinthopyga but no such response was found in the flies from the tropical lowlands. However, both tropical and temperate flies could be protected against heat injury (45-degrees-C) by first exposing them to a mild heat shock (2 h at 40-degrees-C). The supercooling point is not a good indicator of cold tolerance: supercooling points of pupae were similar in all species, ranging from -18.9 to -23.0-degrees-C, and no differences were found between the tropical and temperate species. Among the temperate species, glycerol, the major cryoprotectant, can be elevated by short-term exposure to 0-degrees-C, but glycerol could not be detected in the tropical flies. Low-temperature (0-degrees-C) exposure also increased hemolymph osmolality of the temperate species, but no such increase was observed in the tropical lowland species. Adaptations to temperature stress thus differ in tropical and temperate flesh flies: while flies from both geographic areas share a mechanism for rapidly increasing heat tolerance, only the temperate flies appear capable of responding rapidly to cold stress. The presence of a heat shock response in species that lack the ability to rapidly respond to cold stress indicates that the biochemical and physiological bases for these two responses are likely to differ.																	0174-1578						1990	160	5					543	547										WOS:A1990EP22100010

J	Kimura, MT				Kimura, M. T.			Interspecific and geographic variation of diapause intensity and seasonal adaptation in the Drosophila auraria species complex (Diptera: Drosophilidae)	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												Species of the Drosophila auraria complex entered reproductive diapause in autumn in response to short daylengths. Their diapause ended even at short daylengths without special stimuli. For D. auraria Peng, D. triauraria Bock & Wheeler and D. subauraria Kimura, duration of diapause was longer at a shorter daylength but such a relationship was not clear in D. biauraria Bock & Wheeler. High temperature or continuous illumination broke diapause but chilling had a small or no effect in terminating diapause. In outdoor cultures of D. auraria and D. triauraria, diapause was almost terminated by spring in individuals which had eclosed in early autumn, but not in most individuals which had eclosed in mid-or late autumn. Excluding D. biauraria (below), for sympatric populations D. subauraria had the deepest diapause, D. auraria had the shallowest one and D. triauraria had the intermediate one. It was proposed that the deeper diapause of D. subauraria or D. triauraria was an adaptation to the earlier start of its diapause in autumn. Also in these three species, diapause was deeper in northern populations. This variation may occur because northern populations enter diapause earlier and experience relatively longer daylengths which are less effective in maintaining diapause. D. biauraria had rather deep diapause compared with the other three species and this species did not show clinal variation in the diapause intensity.																	0269-8463						1988	2	2					177	183		10.2307/2389693								WOS:000208584300007

J	Istock, CA; Weisburg, WG				Istock, Conrad A.; Weisburg, William G.			Strong habitat selection and the development of population structure in a mosquito	EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY												Remarkably simple and regular patterns of genic variation for two electrophoretically assayed loci are presented against a background of strong habitat selection, population isolation, and population structuring in the pitcher-plant mosquito Wyeomyia smithii. The genic variation assessed thus far comes from 29 local populations, all but one of which lie within the glaciated region of North America. Although the conclusions drawn from these patterns are still quite tentative, it appears that the fact that the same higher frequency electromorphs occurred everywhere for both loci may be due more to selection than drift. Drift or selection, acting alone or in concert may be responsible for the almost complete absence of electromorphs of intermediate frequency. A weak association was found between the two-locus genic variation and the well-studied diapause-development time variation in this species. It is suggested that a Wrightian interaction system and fluctuating-stabilizing selection might account for maintenance of the genic level polymorphism. The observations reported are circumstantially in accord with Wright's shifting balance process of evolution. Future studies in the older parts of the species range will put these hypotheses to a strong test.																	0269-7653					OCT	1987	1	4					348	362		10.1007/BF02071558								WOS:000208032400005
