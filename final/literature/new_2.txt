J	Lemmen, J; Evenden, M				Lemmen, Joelle; Evenden, Maya			Environmental conditions terminate reproductive diapause and influence pheromone perception in the long-lived moth Caloptilia fraxinella	PHYSIOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												Reproductive diapause enables long-lived insects to time mating with environmental conditions suitable for offspring development. Plasticity in the perception of pheromones used in sexual communication may enable mate-finding at the appropriate time of year. The moth Caloptilia fraxinella (Ely) (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae) undergoes a 9-month reproductive diapause, during which the male response to pheromone is plastic and is highest during the period of reproductive activity. The mechanisms controlling this pheromone response plasticity are not well-understood, and the aim of the present study is to determine the main factors involved. In the present study, the impact of temperature, photoperiod, juvenile hormone analogue (JHA) and adult nutrition on diapause termination are tested using electroantennogram (EAG) and behavioural response to pheromone in male C. fraxinella. Eclosion in a state of reproductive diapause occurs in most males; diapause is maintained under short-day or cool conditions indoors, or under natural conditions outdoors. Exposure to long-day, warm conditions over a period of 4weeks causes a small number of males to become behaviourally responsive to pheromone; a larger number of males become behaviourally responsive over a period of 3months of post-eclosion. Treatment with a JHA impacts male EAG and the behavioural response to pheromone during the period of reproductive diapause. A carbohydrate food source is not required by reproductively active adult male C. fraxinella to respond to pheromone and express mate location behaviours. The main factors involved in controlling male pheromone response plasticity and the implications of these factors for the C.fraxinella population in its expanded range are discussed.

Role of light wavelengths in synchronization of circadian physiology in songbirds	PHYSIOLOGY & BEHAVIOR												This study investigated whether at identical duration and equal energy level birds presented with short (450 nm; blue, B) and long (640 nm; red, R) light wavelengths would differentially interpret them and exhibit wavelength-dependent circadian behavioral and physiological responses, despite the difference in their breeding latitudes. Temperate migratory blackheaded buntings (Emberiza melanocephala) and subtropical non-migratory Indian weaverbirds (Ploceus philippinus) initially entrained to 12 h light:12 h darkness (12L:12D; L = 0.33 mu M/m(2)/s, D = 0 mu M/m(2)/s) in two groups of each, groups 1 and 2, were subjected to constant light (LL, 0.33 mu M/m(2)/5), which rendered them arrhythmic in the activity behavior. They were then exposed for about two weeks each to 12B:12R and 12R:12B (group 1) or 12R:12B and 12B:12R (group 2) at 033 mu M/m(2)/s light energy level. Blue and red light periods were interpreted as the day and night, respectively, with activity and no-activity in non-migratory weaverbirds or activity and intense activity (Zugunruhe, migratory night restlessness) in the migratory buntings. Consistent with this, plasma melatonin levels under B:R, not R:B, light cycle were low and high in blue and red light periods, respectively. A similar diurnal pattern was absent in the cortisol levels, however. These results show an important role of light wavelengths in synchronization of the circadian clock governed behavior and physiology to the photoperiodic environment, and suggest that photoperiodic timing might be a conserved physiological adaptation in many more birds, regardless of the difference in breeding latitudes, than has been generally envisaged.

(Lepidoptera: Crambidae), unlike many temperate insects and despite its wide distribution range, has a geographically stable value of the critical photoperiod for diapause induction. It has thus been hypothesized that the species could adjust its life cycle to different climates in an alternative way, which should be reflected in geographical variation and/or environmental plasticity of some other ecophysiological trait. Three remote populations of the beet webworm were studied. The insects were reared from egg to adult at several combinations of temperature and photoperiod in order to measure development times of all the immature stages and pre-pupal body weight, and to characterize the sensitivity of these life-history traits to the two ecological factors. The thermal reaction norms for immature development appeared to be significantly different in the three populations. There was also a significant effect of photoperiod on development time as well as on the thermal sensitivity and lower temperature threshold for larval development. Pre-pupae from the northernmost population were heavier and their body mass was more strongly affected by photoperiod than in the other two, but attainment of a greater weight under short-day conditions, especially combined with higher temperatures, was common for all the three populations. Nevertheless, all the discovered geographical and environmentally induced differences in life-history traits were very small and their adaptive significance remains problematic.

Cold acclimation is influenced to various degrees by growth cessation and photoacclimation. The effects of both factors on winter survival were investigated by measuring photosynthetic activity with Handy Pea fluorimeter and leaf elongation growth rate (LER) and their effects on winter survival. Triplicate field trials were established at two locations in Norway: Fureneset (61 degrees N) and Vagones (67 degrees N). In total, ten entries of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne), Festulolium hybrids and introgression lines, and meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis) were investigated weekly by measuring selected leaves (n = 3 x 10) of the regrowth after the third harvest taken in late August in two successive years. The results showed that the relationship between photosynthetic performance in autumn, LER and winter survival differed between the locations. In the south (Fureneset), there was a positive correlation between photosynthetic activity before winter and winter survival. In the north (Vagones), there was no correlation or even a negative correlation between photosynthetic activity before winter and winter survival. Low photosynthetic activity in autumn was associated with a higher level of winter survival in the north for E pratensis cv. Norild and two northern-adapted cultivars of L perenne. Northern-adapted forage grasses can be assumed to have an alternative mechanism for growth inhibition, since in the north the amount of light seems to be insufficient to trigger the changes in photosynthetic apparatus that are responsible for growth cessation in the south. Moreover, with progressing climate change, this adaptation pattern will increasingly be required in more southerly areas of the Nordic region because the light intensity decrease and temperature increase predicted for these areas will delay cold acclimation.

Daylength influences the response of three clover species (Trifolium spp.) to short-term ozone stress	BOREAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												Long photoperiods characteristic of summers at high latitudes can increase ozone-induced foliar injury in subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum). This study compared the effects of long photoperiods on ozone injury in red and white clover cultivars adapted to shorter or longer daylengths of southern or northern Fennoscandia. Plants were exposed to 70 ppb ozone for six hours during the daytime for three consecutive days. Simultaneously, the daylength in the growth rooms was altered to long-day (10 h light; 14 h dim light) and short-day (10 h light; 14 h darkness) conditions. Thermal imaging showed that ozone disrupted leaf temperature and stomatal function, particularly in sensitive species, in which leaf temperature deviations persisted for several days after ozone exposure. Long-day conditions increased visible foliar injury (30%-70%), characterized by chlorotic and necrotic areas, relative to short day conditions in all species and cultivars independently of the photoperiod in the region they were adapted to.																	1239-6095	1797-2469				FEB 27	2015	20	1					90	104										WOS:000350935900007

In the present study, we examined the inheritance of diapause induction and termination by crossing the two strains under a range of environmental conditions. The N strain showed a typical long-day response with a critical daylength of approximately 15.88 h at 22 degrees C, 15.72 h at 25 degrees C and 15.14 h at 28 degrees C, whereas the S strain showed a weak photoperiodic response at 22 degrees C. The F1 progeny also showed a long-day response at 22, 25 and 28 degrees C. However, the critical daylengths in S female x N male crosses were significantly longer than those in N female x S male crosses, indicating a sex linkage in the inheritance of diapause induction, with the male parent having more influence on the following F1 progeny. The incidence of diapause in S female x N male crosses was the same as in the N strain under short daylengths of 11-13 h, indicating that diapause trait is completely dominant over the non-diapause trait. The critical daylength in backcross to N was significantly longer than it was in backcross to S, showing a grandfather gene effect. Whether the inheritance of diapause fits an additive hypothesis or not was dependent on the rearing photoperiod, and the capacity for diapause was transmitted genetically in the manner of incomplete dominance. The duration of diapause for the reciprocal crosses under different diapause-terminating conditions showed different patterns of inheritance. The results in this study reveal that genetic and genetic-environmental interactions are involved in diapause induction and termination in O. furnacalis.																	1932-6203					FEB 23	2015	10	2							e0118186	10.1371/journal.pone.0118186								WOS:000350662100149	25706525

Variation in Drosophila melanogaster central metabolic genes appears driven by natural selection both within and between populations	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												In this report, we examine the hypothesis that the drivers of latitudinal selection observed in the eastern US Drosophila melanogaster populations are reiterated within seasons in a temperate orchard population in Pennsylvania, USA. Specifically, we ask whether alleles that are apparently favoured in northern populations are also favoured early in the spring, and decrease in frequency from the spring to autumn with the population expansion. We use SNP data collected for 46 metabolic genes and 128 SNPs representing the central metabolic pathway and examine for the aggregate SNP allele frequencies whether the association of allele change with latitude and that with increasing days of spring-autumn season are reversed. Testing by random permutation, we observe a highly significant negative correlation between these associations that is consistent with this expectation. This correlation is stronger when we confine our analysis to only those alleles that show significant latitudinal changes. This pattern is not caused by association with chromosomal inversions. When data are resampled using SNPs for amino acid change the relationship is not significant but is supported when SNPs associated with cis-expression are only considered. Our results suggest that climate factors driving latitudinal molecular variation in a metabolic pathway are related to those operating on a seasonal level within populations.

LIFE CYCLES AND PRODUCTION OF THREE PREDATORY STONEFLY SPECIES (PLECOPTERA, INSECTA) IN THE KEDROVAYA RIVER (SOUTHERN PRIMORYE)	ZOOLOGICHESKY ZHURNAL												The life cycle and production of predatory stonefly (Skwala compacta, Stavsolus manchuricus, and Kamitnuria exilis) populations were studied in a small salmon river (the Kedrovaya stream) at the "Kedrovaya Pad" Reserve in southern Primorye. S. compacta and S. manchuricus are univoltine with direct embryonic development and slow nymphal growth during 311 and 294 days, respectively, including the growth at low water temperatures in winter. The life history of S. compacta was characterized by the synchronous emergence and recruitment of its population, continuous increase in the nymphal body weight from May to September, rapid growth in October-November, and the sustained weight gain during winter months until emergence in April-May The life history of S. manchuricus was distinguished by the long-term emergence in May-July and the recruitment of the population from July to September, as well as by a wide range of age-length features, presumably related to the specificity of the reproductive system in adults and an external delay of the nymphal growth of early instars at high water temperature in late summer and early autumn. Nymphs of S. manchuricus grow actively at 0.2 degrees C in winter providing a competitive advantage for this species over S. compacta and K. exilis. The growth of the latter slowed down or was absent in winter months. The semivoltine life history of K exilis, with a diapause in the embryonic development during 9 months lasted about 4 years with the underwent winter nymphal quiescence from December to February. The extended emergence and oviposition were registered from the end of July to September. The structure of the K. exilis population is complex; it is represented by 3 cohorts, the sizes of which were overlapped due to the extended flight period and recruitment of the population with nymphs of a new generation in the spring of the next year. Stoneflies K exilis grow fast in warm time, when S. compacta and S. manchuricus just appeared in the stream, or interrupted their growth at relatively high water temperatures in summer. The annual production of three species varied from 0.045 to 0.383 g DM/m(2), P/B-annual was 1.1-6.9; P/B-cohort = 6.2-9.1, and P/B-year = 4.1-9.4. The low values of P/B-annual and P/B-year were found in semivoltine K exilis, and high ones - in univoltine S. compacta. The latter had the higher cohort specific growth rate; its specific production was 0.026 day(-)1. In the K exilis population, the cohort specific growth rate (0.013 day(-1)) and specific production (0.004 day(-1)) were characterized by the low values. The highest production was observed in the S. manchuricus population, where nymphs grew with the specific rate of 0.023 day(-1), and their average density reached 59 ind./m(2).																	0044-5134					FEB	2015	94	2					176	187		10.7868/S0044513415020105								WOS:000352248000005

Photoperiod-Induced Geographic Variation in Plant Defense Chemistry	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY												Spatial variation in chemical defense of plants can be caused by genetic, biotic, and abiotic factors. For example, many plants exhibit a latitudinal cline in chemical defense, potentially due to latitudinal variation in abiotic environmental factors such as the light regime during the growing season. In the worldwide distributed Plantago lanceolata, the levels of deterrent iridoid glycosides (IGs), aucubin and catalpol, vary geographically, including latitudinally. To examine whether latitudinal variation in photoperiod can explain part of this geographic variation, plants from the Netherlands and Finland were exposed to two different photoperiods, simulating the Dutch (middle European) and Finnish (northern European) light period during the growing season. The experiment showed that although most variation in IG content was genetic, plants from both Dutch and Finnish origin produce relatively more catalpol under a northern European than under a middle European photoperiod. Our results confirm that latitudinal effects on photoperiod can contribute to geographic variation in plant defense chemistry, which should be considered when studying latitudinal clines in plant-enemy interactions.																	0098-0331	1573-1561				FEB	2015	41	2					139	148		10.1007/s10886-015-0550-5								WOS:000350885700003	25637332

Opsin Clines in Butterflies Suggest Novel Roles for Insect Photopigments	MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Opsins are ancient molecules that enable animal vision by coupling to a vitamin-derived chromophore to form light-sensitive photopigments. The primary drivers of evolutionary diversification in opsins are thought to be visual tasks related to spectral sensitivity and color vision. Typically, only a few opsin amino acid sites affect photopigment spectral sensitivity. We show that opsin genes of the North American butterfly Limenitis arthemis have diversified along a latitudinal cline, consistent with natural selection due to environmental factors. We sequenced single nucleotide (SNP) polymorphisms in the coding regions of the ultraviolet (UVRh), blue (BRh), and long-wavelength (LWRh) opsin genes from ten butterfly populations along the eastern United States and found that a majority of opsin SNPs showed significant clinal variation. Outlier detection and analysis of molecular variance indicated that many SNPs are under balancing selection and show significant population structure. This contrasts with what we found by analysing SNPs in the wingless and EF-1 alpha loci, and from neutral amplified fragment length polymorphisms, which show no evidence of significant locus-specific or genome-wide structure among populations. Using a combination of functional genetic and physiological approaches, including expression in cell culture, transgenic Drosophila, UV-visible spectroscopy, and optophysiology, we show that key BRh opsin SNPs that vary clinally have almost no effect on spectral sensitivity. Our results suggest that opsin diversification in this butterfly is more consistent with natural selection unrelated to spectral tuning. Some of the clinally varying SNPs may instead play a role in regulating opsin gene expression levels or the thermostability of the opsin protein. Lastly, we discuss the possibility that insect opsins might have important, yet-to-be elucidated, adaptive functions in mediating animal responses to abiotic factors, such as temperature or photoperiod.

When 1,486 eggs were placed on wet tissue paper within a day of oviposition, they took from 7 to > 40 days to hatch, although 85.9 % of larvae hatched between 7 and 13 days following oviposition; 71 % of females produced larvae with long egg periods of 21 or more days. When 78 newly hatched larvae with different egg-period lengths were reared singly in sections of mulberry shoots, 39 emerged as adults between 57 and 117 days posthatching. Dissection showed two feeding larvae and a diapause pupa in shoot sections 141-168 days after larval hatching. A tradeoff was observed between the egg-period length and the time taken for postembryonic development in females, but not in males. Egg-period length did not affect adult body size. An increased amount of available food (volume of shoot sections) increased adult body size but did not affect the time for postembryonic development.																	0003-6862	1347-605X				FEB	2015	50	1					49	55		10.1007/s13355-014-0301-z								WOS:000349305700008

On the difference in the net ecosystem exchange of CO2 between deciduous and evergreen forests in the southeastern United States	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												The southeastern United States is experiencing a rapid regional increase in the ratio of pine to deciduous forest ecosystems at the same time it is experiencing changes in climate. This study is focused on exploring how these shifts will affect the carbon sink capacity of southeastern US forests, which we show here are among the strongest carbon sinks in the continental United States. Using eight-year-long eddy covariance records collected above a hardwood deciduous forest (HW) and a pine plantation (PP) co-located in North Carolina, USA, we show that the net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) was more variable in PP, contributing to variability in the difference in NEE between the two sites (NEE) at a range of timescales, including the interannual timescale. Because the variability in evapotranspiration (ET) was nearly identical across the two sites over a range of timescales, the factors that determined the variability in NEE were dominated by those that tend to decouple NEE from ET. One such factor was water use efficiency, which changed dramatically in response to drought and also tended to increase monotonically in nondrought years (P<0.001 in PP). Factors that vary over seasonal timescales were strong determinants of the NEE in the HW site; however, seasonality was less important in the PP site, where significant amounts of carbon were assimilated outside of the active season, representing an important advantage of evergreen trees in warm, temperate climates. Additional variability in the fluxes at long-time scales may be attributable to slowly evolving factors, including canopy structure and increases in dormant season air temperature. Taken together, study results suggest that the carbon sink in the southeastern United States may become more variable in the future, owing to a predicted increase in drought frequency and an increase in the fractional cover of southern pines.

J	Saltre, F; Duputie, A; Gaucherel, C; Chuine, I				Saltre, Frederik; Duputie, Anne; Gaucherel, Cedric; Chuine, Isabelle			How climate, migration ability and habitat fragmentation affect the projected future distribution of European beech	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Recent efforts to incorporate migration processes into species distribution models (SDMs) are allowing assessments of whether species are likely to be able to track their future climate optimum and the possible causes of failing to do so. Here, we projected the range shift of European beech over the 21st century using a process-based SDM coupled to a phenomenological migration model accounting for population dynamics, according to two climate change scenarios and one land use change scenario. Our model predicts that the climatically suitable habitat for European beech will shift north-eastward and upward mainly because (i) higher temperature and precipitation, at the northern range margins, will increase survival and fruit maturation success, while (ii) lower precipitations and higher winter temperature, at the southern range margins, will increase drought mortality and prevent bud dormancy breaking. Beech colonization rate of newly climatically suitable habitats in 2100 is projected to be very low (1-2% of the newly suitable habitats colonised). Unexpectedly, the projected realized contraction rate was higher than the projected potential contraction rate. As a result, the realized distribution of beech is projected to strongly contract by 2100 (by 36-61%) mainly due to a substantial increase in climate variability after 2050, which generates local extinctions, even at the core of the distribution, the frequency of which prevents beech recolonization during more favourable years. Although European beech will be able to persist in some parts of the trailing edge of its distribution, the combined effects of climate and land use changes, limited migration ability, and a slow life-history are likely to increase its threat status in the near future.

These models can be adapted to analyze diverse processes in evolutionary ecology. By linking models across life stages, they can predict life cycles and generation times. By incorporating fitness, they can identify environmental and physiological factors that limit species distributions. By incorporating population variance, they can investigate mechanisms of intraspecific variation or synchronization. By incorporating genetics, they can predict genotype-specific phenology under diverse climatic scenarios and examine causes and consequences of pleiotropy across life stages. With further development, they have the potential to predict genotype-specific ranges and identify key genes involved in determining phenology and fitness in variable and changing environments.

Patterns of diapause frequency and emergence in swede midges of southern Ontario	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST ENTOMOLOGY												The swede midge is an invasive pest of crucifers in North America and exhibits temporal plasticity in diapause; diapause frequencies change throughout the growing season and spring emergence is typically bimodal. Factors controlling the timing of swede midge diapause events are not well understood. Pre-diapause larval swede midge populations were isolated within cages in the field and tracked for emergence over 3 years. Diapause frequency was inversely correlated with photoperiod and absolute maximum air temperature, however photoperiod did not influence emergence timing. Emergence from diapause occurred in two large peaks, in mid-June and early July, with a third, smaller peak in late August. Emergence phenotypes may correspond to different diapause durations from 236 to 296 days, or post-diapause development requiring between 516 and 1449 degree days. Approximately 2% of swede midges overwintered for 2 years. Early control efforts would be most effective if they targeted the diapausing cohort (i.e. adults emerging June to July) to prevent damage by subsequent generations. Although few individuals overwintered for 2 years, prolonged diapause should be considered when crop rotation is employed for swede midge management.

Jessica E.; Wilczek, Amity M.; Schmitt, Johanna; Donohue, Kathleen			Modeling the Influence of Genetic and Environmental Variation on the Expression of Plant Life Cycles across Landscapes	AMERICAN NATURALIST												Organisms develop through multiple life stages that differ in environmental tolerances. The seasonal timing, or phenology, of life-stage transitions determines the environmental conditions to which each life stage is exposed and the length of time required to complete a generation. Both environmental and genetic factors contribute to phenological variation, yet predicting their combined effect on life cycles across a geographic range remains a challenge. We linked submodels of the plasticity of individual life stages to create an integrated model that predicts life-cycle phenology in complex environments. We parameterized the model for Arabidopsis thaliana and simulated life cycles in four locations. We compared multiple genotypes by varying two parameters associated with natural genetic variation in phenology: seed dormancy and floral repression. The model predicted variation in life cycles across locations that qualitatively matches observed natural phenology. Seed dormancy had larger effects on life-cycle length than floral repression, and results suggest that a genetic cline in dormancy maintains a life-cycle length of 1 year across the geographic range of this species. By integrating across life stages, this approach demonstrates how genetic variation in one transition can influence subsequent transitions and the geographic distribution of life cycles more generally.

Hallauer's Tuson: a decade of selection for tropical-to-temperate phenological adaptation in maize	HEREDITY												Crop species exhibit an astounding capacity for environmental adaptation, but genetic bottlenecks resulting from intense selection for adaptation and productivity can lead to a genetically vulnerable crop. Improving the genetic resiliency of temperate maize depends upon the use of tropical germplasm, which harbors a rich source of natural allelic diversity. Here, the adaptation process was studied in a tropical maize population subjected to 10 recurrent generations of directional selection for early flowering in a single temperate environment in Iowa, USA. We evaluated the response to this selection across a geographical range spanning from 43.05 degrees (WI) to 18.00 degrees (PR) latitude. The capacity for an all-tropical maize population to become adapted to a temperate environment was revealed in a marked fashion: on average, families from generation 10 flowered 20 days earlier than families in generation 0, with a nine-day separation between the latest generation 10 family and the earliest generation 0 family. Results suggest that adaptation was primarily due to selection on genetic main effects tailored to temperature-dependent plasticity in flowering time. Genotype-by-environment interactions represented a relatively small component of the phenotypic variation in flowering time, but were sufficient to produce a signature of localized adaptation that radiated latitudinally, in partial association with daylength and temperature, from the original location of selection. Furthermore, the original population exhibited a maladaptive syndrome including excessive ear and plant heights along with later flowering; this was reduced in frequency by selection for flowering time.

However, little is known about how environmental variables affect the phenology and water dynamics of these species. We aim to understand which variables initiate the vegetative phenophases of species in a tropical semiarid climate at 3 degrees S latitude, where variation in photoperiod is minimal and rainfall is seasonal. We hypothesize that groups of species with similar vegetative phenologies, under similar conditions, are functionally similar in terms of water storage and use. We analyse the relationship between functional characteristics related to the acquisition and utilization of water, such as wood density, water storage capacity, water potential and vegetative phenology. The attributes were ordered by multidimensional scaling, and a multiple response permutation procedure was used to test consistency of the groups. Canonical correspondence analysis and Mantel tests were used to evaluate the phenophase response to environmental variables. We found four functional groups: (i) deciduous low wood density, which lose 75% of their leaves one month before the end of the rains; (ii) evergreen high wood density; (iii) early deciduous high wood density, which lose 75% of their leaves one month after the end of the rains; and (iv) late deciduous high wood density, which lose 75% of their leaves two months after the end of the rains. As expected, the vegetative phenodynamics of the deciduous high wood density group were mainly influenced by water availability. The evergreens did not show a correlation with rainfall. Only leaf shedding of the late deciduous, and the vegetative phenophases of the evergreens, responded to an increase in temperature and photoperiod. Bud-break responded to increased photoperiod and soil humidity in the deciduous low wood density group. The foliar periodicity groups can be explained by the presence of species that differ mainly in their mechanisms of water acquisition and use.																	1442-9985	1442-9993				FEB	2015	40	1					40	49		10.1111/aec.12165								WOS:000347700400005

QUALITY EVALUATION OF A NEW STRAIN OF ARTEMIA FROM SEBKHA EZ-ZEMOUL, ALGERIA: BIOMETRY, HATCHING AND FATTY ACID COMPOSITION	VIE ET MILIEU-LIFE AND ENVIRONMENT												The brine shrimp Artemia (Crustacea: Anostraca) is one of the most commonly used live preys in aquaculture. The quality of its cysts can vary from a strain to another and the study of its descriptors is of great importance for considering an eventual exploitation. Cysts and instar I nauplii of A. salina (Linnaeus, 1758) from Sebkha Ez-Zemoul have been characterized with regards to their biometry, hatching quality and fatty acid profile. The diameter of the cysts and the size of nauplii didn't vary with the sampling periods of 2004 and 2006 (P > 0.05), and are respectively around 247 mu m and between 460.43 +/- 19.88 and 469.2 +/- 34.3 mu m. The chorion thickness is between 11.73 and 14.79 mu m and the individual dry weight of nauplii is of 2.41 mu g. Cysts harvested in water gave better results than those from the banks and the highest values of hatching percentage (57.93 %), efficiency (113,720 nauplii. g(-1)) and yield (0.239 g) were obtained after treatment of diapause deactivation with hydrogen peroxide. The hatching synchronization time is rather short and varied between 6 h and 8.83 h. Fatty acids analysis has shown that the percentage of unsaturated FAs was of 51.55 %. The only FA of the serial (n-3) was the linolenic acid LLA, 18: 3n-3 with 6.43 %.

The majority of these experiments were conducted on initially dried seeds. The desiccation and LN exposure tolerance of fresh P. avium seeds is unknown. In the present study, fresh seeds were used to determine seed response to desiccation and cryopreservation. Desiccation of seeds from a moisture content (MC) of 19.7-20.2% to 10.1-10.9% or 07.6-8.5% reduced seedling emergence from approximately 73 to 19 and 16% for first provenance; and from approximately 89 to 10-12% for second provenance of seeds. After exposure to LN, seeds had the highest seedling emergence when seed MC was the highest (19.7 and 20.2%, respectively) prior to cryostorage. Results indicated that P. avium seeds should be classified as intermediate. For cryopreservation in seed banks, we recommend that seeds be dried directly after extraction from fruits in the range of 16.8-20.2% of MC (0.21-0.25 g.g(-1) of WC) and directly immersed in LN in tightly closed cryovials.																	2391-5412					JAN	2015	10	1					354	364		10.1515/biol-2015-0036								WOS:000371475600009						
J	Jones, GA; Russell, W				Jones, Gregory A.; Russell, Will			APPROXIMATION OF FIRE-RETURN INTERVALS WITH POINT SAMPLES IN THE SOUTHERN RANGE OF THE COAST REDWOOD FOREST, CALIFORNIA, USA	FIRE ECOLOGY												A legacy of past fires is evident in the form of blackened basal hollows found throughout the southern range of the coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens [D. Don] Endl.) forest. A deeper look reveals cambial scars dating back centuries, telling a story of low-to moderate-intensity fires that burned periodically across California's Central Coast bioregion. While attempts have been made to reconstruct the fire history of this forest type, estimates of the fire-return interval vary widely, and the relationship of the fire-return interval to varying cultural influences is not fully understood. We analyzed 373 fire scars from 70 cross-sections removed from stumps, downed logs, and live trees in the coastal Santa Cruz Mountains of California, USA, in order to estimate fire-return intervals (FRI) for individual trees, mean FRI across samples, and seasonality of historical fires. The mean FRI, averaged across point samples, was 60.6 yr with a median of 40.1 yr. Fire scars were most prevalent in the dormant and latewood portions of annual growth rings. A sub-sample of 19 cross-sections, for which we were able to determine approximate fire years, exhibited a high degree of variation between samples with individual tree FRIs ranging from 10.4 yr to 128 yr. The mean FRI of 43.3 yr was marginally higher for the pre-settlement period (1352 to 1849) compared to 30.7 yr for the settlement period (1850 to 1924) and 32.3 yr for the recent period (1925 to 2013). While our results suggest a longer estimate of fire-return intervals than previously documented for this forest type, high variation within and between samples clouded distinctions and illustrates a culturally constructed fire regime characterized by temporal and spatial heterogeneity.																	1933-9747						2015	11	3					80	94		10.4996/fireecology.1103080								WOS:000367132700007

The developmental times and survival of the immature stages of this tingid were determined at 16, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31, 34, 35.5, 37 and 39 degrees C, 60 +/- 10% relative humidity and under a 16L : 8D photoperiod. At 16 and 39 degrees C, 100% mortality was recorded during immature development, with the egg, first and second nymphal instars the most susceptible. The lowest mortality was recorded at 28 degrees C (9.8%). As temperature increased, the total developmental period decreased and the shortest duration was recorded at 34 degrees C (12.1-12.2 d). At 37 degrees C, the developmental time was slightly longer (12.5-13.0 d). The thermal requirement for complete development, from egg to adult, was 229.2 DD. Several non-linear models were fitted to the developmental rate data recorded for the range of temperatures tested. Selection criteria indicated that the Lactin model best described the relationship between developmental rate and temperature. It predicted lower and upper thermal thresholds for the complete preimaginal period of 14.8 and 39.1 degrees C, respectively. Models were validated by comparing their predictions for the total preimaginal period with the developmental times recorded at three different fluctuating temperature regimes. The Lactin model again best fitted the actual durations recorded. This model could be used in IPM programs for predicting the moment of occurrence of the most damaging generations of this species.

The organism's potential resistance to the toxic effects of xenobiotics can be determined based on cholinesterase activity. The activity of cholinesterases (ChEs) towards acetylcholine (ACh) and butyrylcholine (BCh) was determined in extracts of diapausing (between October and late March) and flying bees (May). In both males and females, enzyme activity was higher towards ACh than towards BCh. The ratio of ACh/BCh activity was determined in the range of 1.43 to 4.15 in diapausing females and 3.00 to 7.18 in diapausing males. No significant changes in ChE activity towards ACh were observed in females before December and in males before February. Enzyme activity towards ACh increased dynamically in the second half of March. Enzyme activity towards BCh remained stable in both sexes until mid-March, after which it increased significantly. Excluding mid-March, enzyme BCh activity was significantly higher in females than in males. The activity of carboxylesterase towards 4-p-nitrophenyl butyrate was determined in females to assess the involvement of non-specific esterases in the hydrolysis of choline esters. Carboxylesterase activity was low in comparison with cholinesterase activity, and it remained practically unchanged throughout diapause, suggesting that choline esters in female O. bicornis extracts were hydrolyzed mainly by acetylcholinesterases.																	0015-5497	1734-9168					2015	63	4					235	240		10.3409/fb63_4.235								WOS:000365934100002	26975137

Here, not the whole input is known at the beginning, but it is only revealed gradually. These problems frequently occur in practice, and therefore the performance of algorithms for such problems is of great theoretical and practical interest. One such online problem is energy management in electronic devices, e.g., smartphones. As such a device is usually not being used permanently, it is reasonable to change to a lower-energy state (like hibernation) after a certain idle time. Resuming from hibernation, however, also needs a certain amount of energy; therefore, hibernation should only happen if the idle period is long. Advice complexity is a recent approach for measuring the information content of an online problem, i.e., the amount of knowledge about the future parts of the input that is necessary to compute a high-quality solution. The approach allows for a more fine-grained analysis of the hardness of online problems than the classical competitive analysis. We analyze the advice complexity of this problem. For systems with two states, we construct an online algorithm with advice that is 1.8-competitive with one advice bit and 1.6-competitive with five advice bits, whereas every deterministic algorithm without advice is known to be no better than 2-competitive. Moreover, the algorithm's competitive ratio converges fast towards e/(e-1) with an increasing number of advice bits. For competitive ratios in the range [1, e/(e-1)], we present two complementary algorithms: one behaves optimally on a certain prefix, and the other falls asleep on the longest phases. Conversely, we show that every algorithm with a competitive ratio less than 1 + 1/(4w + 2), where w is the wake-up energy, needs to read a linear number of advice bits.

The phenological change in large scale can not only reflect the seasonal variation patterns of vegetation, but also be an indicator of global climate change. In this study, using the biweekly NOAA/GIMMS NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and meteorological data, we employed the maximum rate of change to extract the phenological change of the vegetation types in Changbai Mountains during 1982-2006, and investigated the possible impact of recent climate change on growing season in three climate zones based on Jingyun Zheng's climatic regionalization. The results were as follows: the onset date of green-up for the vegetation in warm temperate zone was in late April and the onset date of dormancy ended in late October. The length of growing season (LOS) for the vegetation types became shorter with increasing latitude. The earlier onset dates of green-up for all vegetation types were found in three climate zones during 1982-2006, ranging from 0.642 day/yr in Zone I, 0.429 day/yr in Zone II, to 0.371 day/yr in Zone II, which indicates that the earlier onset dates of green-up were significant with a longitude trend of vegetation types. The LOS of the three climate zones became longer during 1982-2006, but the lengthening of growing season demonstrated in different ways in the three climate zones. Temperature had stronger effect on the phenological change. The onset date of green-up was earlier and the corresponding temperature threshold was higher in the low latitude, and the LOS was in significant correlation with the accumulated temperature above 10 degrees C in three climate zones.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2015	24	6A					2193	2202										WOS:000363071600009

Testosterone Mediates Seasonal Growth of the Song Control Nuclei in a Tropical Bird	BRAIN BEHAVIOR AND EVOLUTION												In mid-to high-latitude songbirds, seasonal reproduction is stimulated by increasing day length accompanied by elevated plasma sex steroid levels, increased singing, and growth of the song control nuclei (SCN). Plasticity of the SCN and song behavior are primarily mediated by testosterone (T) and its metabolites in most species studied thus far. However, the majority of bird species are tropical and have less pronounced seasonal reproductive cycles. We have previously documented that equatorial rufous-collared sparrows (Zonotrichia capensis) exhibit seasonal neuroplasticity in the SCN. Manipulating T in these birds, however, did not alter singing behavior. In the current study, we investigated whether T mediates plasticity of the SCN in a similar manner to temperate songbirds. In the first experiment, we treated captive male birds with T or blank implants during the non-breeding season. In a second experiment, we treated captive male birds with either blank implants, T-filled implants, T with flutamide (FLU; an androgen receptor antagonist) or T with FLU and 1,4,6-androstatriene-3,17-dione (ATD; an estrogen synthesis inhibitor) during the breeding season. In both experiments, the volumes of the brain areas high vocal center (HVC), Area X, and robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA) were measured along with singing behavior. In summary, T stimulated growth of HVC and RA, and the combined effect of FLU and ATD reversed this effect in HVC. Area X was not affected by T treatment in either experiment. Neither T-treated birds nor controls sang in captivity during either experiment. Together, these data indicate that T mediates seasonal changes in the HVC and RA of both tropical and higher-latitude bird species even if the environmental signals differ. However, unlike most higher-latitude songbirds, we found no evidence that motivation to sing or growth of Area X are stimulated by T under captive conditions. (C) 2015 S.

We present observations of captive reproductive behaviour following video surveillance and measurements of body temperature collected from six captive female echidnas over a six-year period. In the first series of observations (2009-10) we examined the efficacy of artificial burrow boxes as possible aids for reproductive success. Females with access to burrow boxes had significantly higher levels of reproductive activity (P=0.001), there was coincidental improvement in the production of eggs or pouch young (two eggs, one unhatched and one offspring). During 2009-10, a range of reproductive behaviours (courtship, copulation and postcopulation) were documented and analysed, as were new observations of oestrous cycle activity. Female body temperature was characteristically stable during egg incubation during this study and has the potential to be used as a tool for the assessment of reproductive status. Following initial observations, burrow boxes and infrared lamps were implemented as standard husbandry in our echidna breeding facility and the effects on reproductive success were monitored, albeit less intensively, for a further four years (2011-14). Although no direct causal effect could be ascribed, the use of burrow boxes and heat lamps coincided with a total of 13 young being born to four females in the last four years (2011-14). These female echidnas were found to be receptive at intervals throughout the breeding season, both before and after presumed incubation phases, suggesting that captive animals exhibit polyoestry. In 2012 and 2014, the same female showed evidence of producing two young from one breeding event.																	0004-959X	1446-5698					2015	63	3					181	191		10.1071/ZO14069								WOS:000360397700004

Phenological, but not social, variation associated with climate differences in a eusocial sweat bee, Halictus ligatus, nesting in southern Ontario	JOURNAL OF HYMENOPTERA RESEARCH												Studies of annual and geographic variation in eusocial bee populations suggest that more stringent environmental conditions result in stronger reproductive skew favouring queens, while moderate conditions favour increasing worker reproduction. To test these predictions, we compared the phenology and colony development of H. ligatus nesting in St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada to a previously studied aggregation 90 km north of St. Catharines, in Victoria, Ontario. Despite the close proximity of these two locations, St. Catharines has markedly shorter winters and longer summers. Comparisons between St. Catharines in 2006 and Victoria in the 1980s and 1990s incorporate both geographic differences in climate and temporal differences due to climate change. We predicted that St. Catharines foundress queens should emerge from hibernation and initiate nests earlier in spring, giving them time to produce more workers. Since earlier studies indicated that queens have difficulty suppressing worker reproduction in larger colonies, we also predicted higher rates of worker ovarian development in St. Catharines. In spring and summer 2006, we excavated 65 H. ligatus nests, comparing their contents to 713 specimens collected in pan traps. As predicted, nests were initiated about a month earlier in St. Catharines than in Victoria, but contrary to prediction, fewer workers were produced in St. Catharines. St. Catharines workers were just as likely to have developed ovaries as Victoria workers. About 40% of St. Catharines workers were classified as reproductive, and larger reproductive workers tended to have higher ovarian scores. Early queen mortality in the longer nest cycle of St. Catharines bees may have enhanced opportunities for worker reproduction despite their smaller numbers. Novel features of H. ligatus sociobiology in St. Catharines included evidence that queens can initiate new nests following the loss of their first brood, overlap between worker and gyne production within some nests, and high rates of independent nest founding by worker-sized females, suggesting that many worker-brood females overwinter. Overall, the distinctly warmer climate of St. Catharines compared to Victoria led to earlier nest initiation and lengthening of the flight season, but not to the predicted differences in colony social organisation or queen-worker reproductive skew. A second objective of our study was to assess how well pan trap collections capture important information about demographic and social parameters important in assessing social variability in sweat bees. Nest excavations and pan traps produced similar results, suggesting that pan traps are a good alternative when nest excavations are impossible.

The polysaccharides crude extract from microalgae P. cruentum was added at different concentrations (0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2.0%) in a commercial diet and provided to juvenile L. vannamei (6.6 +/- 0.2 g). The shrimps (n = 2,000) were fed ad libitum for 30 days in circular tanks with 12 m(2) of bottom area (100 shrimp tank(-1)) and environmental variables (temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, photoperiod and levels of total ammonia) were controlled. The supplemented diet with 1% crude extract was responsible for the biggest weight gain (7.28 g) in 30 days. The shrimp body muscle centesimal composition and survival were not affected by the polysaccharide extract supplementation. It was observed a shift in the activity of digestive enzymes from the hepatopancreas to the anterior midgut and mid midgut portions in shrimps with diet supplemented with 1% polysaccharide extract, which may have contributed to a better digestive efficiency.

CB eggs were recently shown to serve as alternative hosts for Ooencyrtus pityocampae Mercet, 1921, an important natural enemy of the pine processionary moth (PPM) Thaumetopoea wilkinsoni Tams, 1924 (Lepidoptera: Notodontidae). In this study various aspects of the life history of CB were studied, including its distribution, host range, development, reproduction and ability to develop on various cultivated species of plants. CB occurs in almost all areas and habitats in Israel, except in the coldest regions, attacking several caper species (Capparis spp.). When reared on Capparis zoharyi at 25 degrees C, one generation lasted 6 weeks and females laid a single 12-egg cluster every 3 days. Decreases in temperature, but not changes in day length, terminated reproductive activity. CB nymphs survived for up to three months, or even completed their development, on some agricultural plants. However, reproductive activity was initiated only if adults were fed capers. These findings emphasize the importance of capers in the CB life cycle and account for why other plants are rarely attacked. These plants may serve as a temporary refuge for CB when capers are scarce or unsuitable, mainly late in the season. Morphology of developmental stages, egg deposition, cannibalistic behaviour, sex ratio and effects of temperature on egg production were also studied. The possibility of using CB for enhancing the biological control of PPM is discussed.																	1210-5759	1802-8829					2015	112	2					362	372		10.14411/eje.2015.041								WOS:000353304300017

Riparian and in-stream controls on nutrient concentrations and fluxes in a headwater forested stream	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Headwater streams are recipients of water sources draining through terrestrial ecosystems. At the same time, stream biota can transform and retain nutrients dissolved in stream water. Yet studies considering simultaneously these two sources of variation in stream nutrient chemistry are rare. To fill this gap of knowledge, we analyzed stream water and riparian groundwater concentrations and fluxes as well as in-stream net uptake rates for nitrate (NO3-), ammonium (NH4+), and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) along a 3.7 km reach on an annual basis. Chloride concentrations (used as conservative tracer) indicated a strong hydrological connection at the riparian stream interface. However, stream and riparian groundwater nutrient concentrations showed a moderate to null correlation, suggesting high in-stream biogeochemical processing. In-stream net nutrient uptake (F-sw) was highly variable across contiguous segments and over time, but its temporal variation was not related to the vegetative period of the riparian forest. For NH4+, the occurrence of F-sw > 0 mu g N m(-1) s(-1) (gross uptake > release) was high along the reach, while for NO3-, the occurrence of F-sw < 0 mu g N m(-1) s(-1) (gross uptake < release) increased along the reach. Within segments and dates, F-sw,F- whether negative or positive, accounted for a median of 6, 18, and 20% of the inputs of NO3-, NH4+, and SRP, respectively. Whole-reach mass balance calculations indicated that instream net uptake reduced stream NH I flux up to 90 %, while the stream acted mostly as a source of NO3- and SRP. During the dormant period, concentrations decreased along the reach for NO3-, but increased for NH4+ and SRP. During the vegetative period, NH4+ decreased, SRP increased, and NO3- showed a U-shaped pattern along the reach. These longitudinal trends resulted from the combination of hydrological mixing with terrestrial inputs and in-stream nutrient processing. Therefore, the assessment of these two sources of variation in stream water chemistry is crucial to understand the contribution of in-stream processes to stream nutrient dynamics at relevant ecological scales.

J	Jonas, JL; Wolesensky, W; Joern, A				Jonas, Jayne L.; Wolesensky, William; Joern, Anthony			Weather Affects Grasshopper Population Dynamics in Continental Grassland Over Annual and Decadal Periods	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT												Understanding the complex dynamics of insect herbivores requires consideration of both exogenous and endogenous factors at multiple temporal scales. This problem is difficult due to differences in population responses among closely related taxa. Increased understanding of dynamic relationships between exogenous and endogenous factors will facilitate forecasting and suggest nodes in the life cycle of economically important species susceptible to intervention by managers. This study uses an information-theoretic approach to examine the contributions of weather and density to model population densities and growth rates of nine common grasshopper species from continental U. S. grassland over 25 years. In general, grass-feeding species and total grass-feeders as a functional group were most closely associated with weather during the year before hatching. Increased variability in prior growing season precipitation was associated with increased densities of Mermiria bivittata, Opeia obscura, Phoetaliotes nebrascensis, and the grass-feeding guild. Melanoplus sanguinipes densities tended to be smaller following warm fall seasons, while Amphitoruns coloradus declined during the positive phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation or after warmer than average winters. Population growth rate dynamics of all grouped species combinations were best explained by models including variability in precipitation during the prior year growing season. Large-scale Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) patterns were also associated with growth rate dynamics of the mixed-feeding species group. Density showed a negative relationship with population growth rates of five species. This study indicates the importance of parental and diapause environmental conditions and the utility of incorporating long-term, readily obtained decadal weather indices for forecasting grasshopper densities and identifying critical years with regard to grasshopper management-at least to the degree that the past will continue to predict the future as global climates change.

Explaining the sawtooth: latitudinal periodicity in a circadian gene correlates with shifts in generation number	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY												Many temperate insects take advantage of longer growing seasons at lower latitudes by increasing their generation number or voltinism. In some insects, development time abruptly decreases when additional generations are fit into the season. Consequently, latitudinal sawtooth' clines associated with shifts in voltinism are seen for phenotypes correlated with development time, like body size. However, latitudinal variation in voltinism has not been linked to genetic variation at specific loci. Here, we show a pattern in allele frequency among voltinism ecotypes of the European corn borer moth (Ostrinia nubilalis) that is reminiscent of a sawtooth cline. We characterized 145 autosomal and sex-linked SNPs and found that period, a circadian gene that is genetically linked to a major QTL determining variation in post-diapause development time, shows cyclical variation between voltinism ecotypes. Allele frequencies at an unlinked circadian clock gene cryptochrome1 were correlated with period. These results suggest that selection on development time to fit' complete life cycles into a latitudinally varying growing season produces oscillations in alleles associated with voltinism, primarily through changes at loci underlying the duration of transitions between diapause and other life history phases. Correlations among clock loci suggest possible coupling between the circadian clock and the circannual rhythms for synchronizing seasonal life history. We anticipate that latitudinal oscillations in allele frequency will represent signatures of adaptation to seasonal environments in other insects and may be critical to understanding the ecological and evolutionary consequences of variable environments, including response to global climate change.																	1010-061X	1420-9101				JAN	2015	28	1					40	53		10.1111/jeb.12562								WOS:000348992900004	25430782

In laboratory trials, the females of Estonian populations accepted various species of Rumex as oviposition substrates. Growth performance of the larvae did not differ between the hosts offered (only R. acetosa proved to be unsuitable). In the field, extensive use of the two most common host species - R. crispus and R. obtusifolius - by the Estonian populations of L. dispar was confirmed. Unlike in the laboratory, larval performance in the field was better on R. obtusifolius than R. crispus. A likely explanation is the more ephemeral character of the aboveground parts of R. crispus plants: these tend to wilt before the larvae of L. dispar have reached the stage adapted to hibernation. A countrywide analysis of landscape occupancy revealed a positive association of the occurrence of L. dispar with ditches and human settlement. We conclude that moderate anthropogenic pressure maintains suitable habitats for L. dispar through creating favourable conditions for R. obtusifolius, the primary host of the butterfly in the region. Due to its generalism in both host and habitat use, L. dispar is not in the need of active conservation measures on the current northern limit of its distribution. The favourable status of the species in Estonia is corroborated by its recent range expansion which parallels similar trends elsewhere in Eastern Europe.

Human-aided and natural dispersal drive gene flow across the range of an invasive mosquito	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Human-aided transport is responsible for many contemporary species introductions, yet the contribution of human-aided transport to dispersal within non-native regions is less clear. Understanding dispersal dynamics for invasive species can streamline mitigation efforts by targeting routes that contribute disproportionally to spread. Because of its limited natural dispersal ability, rapid spread of the Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) has been attributed to human-aided transport, but until now, the relative roles of human-aided and natural movement have not been rigorously evaluated. Here, we use landscape genetics and information-theoretic model selection to evaluate 52 models representing 9240 pairwise dispersal paths among sites across the US range for Ae.albopictus and show that recent gene flow reflects a combination of natural and human-aided dispersal. Highways and water availability facilitate dispersal at a broad spatial scale, but gene flow is hindered by forests at the current distributional limit (range edge) and by agriculture among sites within the mosquito's native climatic niche (range core). Our results show that highways are important to genetic structure between range-edge and range-core pairs, suggesting a role for human-aided mosquito transport to the range edge. In contrast, natural dispersal is dominant at smaller spatial scales, reflecting a shifting dominance to natural movement two decades after introduction. These conclusions highlight the importance of (i) early intervention for species introductions, particularly those with readily dispersed dormant stages and short generation times, and (ii) strict monitoring of commercial shipments for transported immature stages of Ae.albopictus, particularly towards the northern edge of the US range.

Seasonal timing is expected to be particularly important for species that are dependent on resources available during a short time window-so-called phenological specialists-and latitudinal clines in seasonality are expected to favor local adaptation in phenological timing. However, to what degree latitudinal variation in diapause dynamics and post-winter development due to such local adaptation is influenced by the degree of phenological specialization is not well known. We experimentally studied two pierid butterfly species and found that the phenological specialist Anthocharis cardamines had shorter diapause duration than the phenological generalist Pieris napi along a latitudinal gradient in Sweden. Moreover, diapause duration increased with latitude in P. napi but not in A. cardamines. Sensitivity of the two species to winter thermal conditions also differed; additional cold temperature during the winter period shortened diapause duration for P. napi pupae but not for A. cardamines pupae. In both species, post-winter pupal development was faster after longer periods of cold conditions, and more southern populations developed faster than northern populations. Post-winter development was also invariably faster at higher temperatures in both species. We argue that the observed differences in diapause dynamics between the two species might be explained by the difference in phenological specialization that influences the costs of breaking diapause too early in the season.

J	Tanaka, K; Murata, K; Matsuura, A				Tanaka, Koichi; Murata, Kouhei; Matsuura, Asana			Rapid evolution of an introduced insect Ophraella communa LeSage in new environments: temporal changes and geographical differences in photoperiodic response	ENTOMOLOGICAL SCIENCE												The accidentally introduced beetle Ophraella communa was first found in 1996 in Japan and has rapidly expanded its distribution range to include regions with substantially different climates. During this range expansion and subsequent establishment in new habitats, the life history traits of O.communa have changed depending on new habitat environmental conditions. In this study, we investigated the photoperiodic response of O.communa controlling its reproductive diapause, an important trait that adjusts the life cycle to local climate and phenology of host-plants. We examined temporal changes and geographical differences in this trait. In the Tsukuba population of O.communa, the diapause incidence under conditions of 12h light:12h dark (LD 12:12), 13:11 and 14:10 did not consistently increase or decrease during 2005-2012, although it fluctuated yearly. The diapause incidence in this period, however, was lower than that in 1999 reported previously and the critical day-length inducing diapause was shortened by >1h from 1999 to 2005. These results suggest that the photoperiodic response of O.communa shifted during this period. To examine geographical differences in this trait, we compared the Hirosaki, Morioka, Tsukuba and Koshi lines. The diapause incidence at LD13:11 was significantly different between the O.communa lines: 86.5% in the Hirosaki line (collected in 2010) , 81.4% in Morioka (collected in 2010), 45.0% in Tsukuba (collected in 2011) and 7.1% in Koshi (collected in 2009), and was positively correlated with the latitude of the origin. These results suggest that this trait shifted, responding to the environmental conditions in the colonized regions.

Satellite-derived Land Surface Phenology (LSP) offers data for the study of vegetation phenology at landscape to global spatial scales. However, the mechanisms of plant phenological responses to temperature are rarely considered at broad spatial scales, despite the potential improvements to spatiotemporal predictions. Geographical gradients in community species composition may also affect LSP spatially and temporally. Using a modified survival analysis, we reveal how weather and climate relate to physiological chilling and heating requirements and affect deciduous forest green-up in New England, USA over 9 years (2001-2009). While warm daily temperatures lead to earlier green-up of deciduous forests, chilling temperatures had a larger influence on green-up. We also found that the effects of community composition across the landscape were as important as the effects of weather. Greater oak dominance led to later green-up, while sites with more birch tended to have earlier green-up dates. Projection into the future (2046-2065) with statistically downscaled, bias corrected climate model output suggested advanced green-up (8-48 days) driven by higher heating and chilling accumulations, but green-up in coastal areas may be delayed due to reduced chilling accumulation. This study provides an innovative statistical method combining plant physiological mechanisms, topographic spatial heterogeneity, and species composition to predict how LSP responds to climate and weather variation and makes future projections.

Geographic mosaics of phenology, host preference, adult size and microhabitat choice predict butterfly resilience to climate warming	OIKOS												The climate-sensitive butterfly Euphydryas editha exhibited interpopulation variation in both phenology and egg placement, exposing individuals to diverse thermal environments. We measured eggspace' temperatures adjacent to natural egg clutches in populations distributed across a range of latitudes (36 degrees 8-44 degrees 6) and altitudes (213-3171 m). Eggs laid > 50 cm above the ground averaged 3.1 degrees C cooler than ambient air at 1 m height, while eggs at < 1 cm height averaged 15.5 degrees C hotter than ambient, ranging up to 47 degrees C. Because of differences in egg height, eggs at 3171 m elevation and 20.6 degrees C ambient air experienced mean eggspace temperatures 7 degrees C hotter than those at 213 m elevation and ambient 33.3 degrees C. Experimental eggs survived for one hour at 45 degrees C but were killed by 48 degrees C. Eggs laid low, by positively geotactic butterflies, risked thermal stress. However, at populations where eggs were laid lowest, higher oviposition would have incurred incidental predation from grazers. Interpopulation variation in phenology influenced thermal environment and buffered exposure to thermal stress. At sites with hotter July temperatures, the single annual flight/oviposition period was advanced such that eggs were laid on earlier dates, with cooler ambient temperatures. The insects possessed two mechanisms for advancing egg phenology; they could advance timing of larval diapause-breaking and/or shorten the life cycle by becoming smaller adults. Mean weight of newly-eclosed females varied among populations from 92 to 285 mg, suggesting that variable adult size did influence phenology. Possible options for in situ mitigation of thermal stress include further advancing phenology and raising egg height. We argue that these options exist, as evidenced by current variation in these traits and by failure of E. editha to conform to restrictive biogeographic constraints, such as the expectation that populations at equatorial and poleward range limits be confined to higher and lower elevations, respectively. This optimistic example shows how complex local adaptation can generate resilience to climate warming.

Beyond correlations of ranges and climatic parameters, however, physiological tolerances (here: cold tolerance) have rarely been linked to the climate of species' ranges. We hypothesize that natural range shifts due to climate warming and proactive-assisted colonization may each be constrained by limits to the tolerance of species to rare frost events. LocationBayreuth, Germany, and the Northern Hemisphere. MethodsWe quantified cold tolerance (LT50 obtained by relative electrolyte leakage method) of 27 native and exotic (Northern Hemisphere) tree species in the autumn, mid-winter and spring of 2011-12 at the Ecological Botanical Garden of the University of Bayreuth, Germany, and linked observed cold tolerances as well as changes in cold tolerance between sampling dates to the climate of the native ranges of the species. ResultsObserved cold tolerance was strongly related to the climate of the native ranges of the species (cross-validated correlations between climate and expressed cold tolerance determined by boosted regression trees were 0.50 in autumn, 0.49 in mid-winter, and 0.65 in spring). Cold tolerance was generally greater for species that experienced colder temperatures and lower levels of precipitation in their native ranges. Changes in cold tolerance between the three sampling dates over the winter, however, were not linked to the climate of the native ranges. Main conclusionsOur results demonstrate the evolutionary importance of cold tolerance, which should be acknowledged in assisted colonization trials and projections of range shifts by considering absolute minimum temperature as an important ecological factor.

Synchronous Seasonal Change in Fin Whale Song in the North Pacific	PLOS ONE												Fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) song consists of down-swept pulses arranged into stereotypic sequences that can be characterized according to the interval between successive pulses. As in blue (B. musculus) and humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), these song sequences may be geographically distinct and may correlate with population boundaries in some regions. We measured inter-pulse intervals of fin whale songs within year-round acoustic datasets collected between 2000 and 2006 in three regions of the eastern North Pacific: Southern California, the Bering Sea, and Hawaii. A distinctive song type that was recorded in all three regions is characterized by singlet and doublet inter-pulse intervals that increase seasonally, then annually reset to the same shorter intervals at the beginning of each season. This song type was recorded in the Bering Sea and off Southern California from September through May and off Hawaii from December through April, with the song interval generally synchronized across all monitoring locations. The broad geographic and seasonal occurrence of this particular fin whale song type may represent a single population broadly distributed throughout the eastern Pacific with no clear seasonal migratory pattern. Previous studies attempting to infer population structure of fin whales in the North Pacific using synchronous individual song samples have been unsuccessful, likely because they did not account for the seasonal lengthening in song intervals observed here.

Signatures of aestivation and migration in Sahelian malaria mosquito populations	NATURE												During the long Sahelian dry season, mosquito vectors of malaria are expected to perish when no larval sites are available; yet, days after the first rains, mosquitoes reappear in large numbers. How these vectors persist over the 3-6-month long dry season has not been resolved, despite extensive research for over a century(1-3.) Hypotheses for vector persistence include dry-season diapause (aestivation) and long-distance migration (LDM); both are facets of vector biology that have been highly controversial owing to lack of concrete evidence. Here we show that certain species persist by a form of aestivation, while others engage in LDM. Using time-series analyses, the seasonal cycles of Anopheles coluzzii, Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto (s.s.), and Anopheles arabiensis were estimated, and their effects were found to be significant, stable and highly species-specific. Contrary to all expectations, the most complex dynamics occurred during the dry season, when the density of A. coluzzii fluctuated markedly, peaking when migration would seem highly unlikely, whereas A. gambiae s.s. was undetected. The population growth of A. coluzzii followed the first rains closely, consistent with aestivation, whereas the growth phase of both A. gambiae s.s. and A. arabiensis lagged by two months. Such a delay is incompatible with local persistence, but fits LDM. Surviving the long dry season in situ allows A. coluzzii to predominate and form the primary force of malaria transmission. Our results reveal profound ecological divergence between A. coluzzii and A. gambiae s.s., whose standing as distinct species has been challenged, and suggest that climate is one of the selective pressures that led to their speciation. Incorporating vector dormancy and LDM is key to predicting shifts in the range of malaria due to global climate change(4), and to the elimination of malaria from Africa.																	0028-0836	1476-4687				DEC 18	2014	516	7531					387	+		10.1038/nature13987								WOS:000346484800045	25470038

C.			Activity Patterns of Eurasian Lynx Are Modulated by Light Regime and Individual Traits over a Wide Latitudinal Range	PLOS ONE												The activity patterns of most terrestrial animals are regarded as being primarily influenced by light, although other factors, such as sexual cycle and climatic conditions, can modify the underlying patterns. However, most activity studies have been limited to a single study area, which in turn limit the variability of light conditions and other factors. Here we considered a range of variables that might potentially influence the activity of a large carnivore, the Eurasian lynx, in a network of studies conducted with identical methodology in different areas spanning latitudes from 49 degrees 7'N in central Europe to 70 degrees 00'N in northern Scandinavia. The variables considered both light conditions, ranging from a day with a complete day-night cycle to polar night and polar day, as well as individual traits of the animals. We analysed activity data of 38 individual free-ranging lynx equipped with GPS-collars with acceleration sensors, covering more than 11,000 lynx days. Mixed linear additive models revealed that the lynx activity level was not influenced by the daily daylight duration and the activity pattern was bimodal, even during polar night and polar day. The duration of the active phase of the activity cycle varied with the widening and narrowing of the photoperiod. Activity varied significantly with moonlight. Among adults, males were more active than females, and subadult lynx were more active than adults. In polar regions, the amplitude of the lynx daily activity pattern was low, likely as a result of the polycyclic activity pattern of their main prey, reindeer. At lower latitudes, the basic lynx activity pattern peaked during twilight, corresponding to the crepuscular activity pattern of the main prey, roe deer. Our results indicated that the basic activity of lynx is independent of light conditions, but is modified by both individual traits and the activity pattern of the locally most important prey.

Climate change effects on red spruce decline mitigated by reduction in air pollution within its shrinking habitat range	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												We investigated the potential effects of projected climate change on red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) growth in the Great Smoky Mountains of Southeastern USA. A model called Annual Radial Increment Model (ARIM) was used to capture ecosystem complexity manifested as direct and indirect effects in multifactorial within- and across-scale interactions. The model was run under different scenarios, including projected climate change under reduced, no change, and increased atmospheric pollution. Modeled red spruce growth at end of 21st century (2080-2099) was compared to modeled growth at end of the 20th century (1980-1999). Red spruce growth at high elevations (>= 1700 m) declined by 10.8% when climate change interacted with a 10% increase in air pollution, but red spruce growth increased by 8.4% when air pollution decreased by 10%. In contrast, red spruce growth at low elevations (<1700 m) declined by 11.2% with a 10% increase in air pollution, 8.9% with no change, and 6.4% with a 10% decrease in air pollution. Our results suggest that red spruce populations at high-elevation may grow more rapidly under climate change if air pollution decreases, but populations at low-elevation may decline irrespective of air pollution changes as habitats shrink.

Botanochara praefica (Spaeth, 1940) is synonymized with B. macularia (Boheman, 1850). Botanochara missionea (Spaeth, 1915) and B. tessellata (Burmeister, 1870) are illustrated for the first time. Botanochara duodecimnotata (Boheman, 1850) and Botanochara segnis (Boheman, 1862) are new country records. Six species are shared with Bolivia, 21 with Brazil, 15 with Paraguay, one with Peru, and 7 with Uruguay. The known geographic distributions, synonymies, hybrids, chromosome numbers, and host plants in Argentina and adjacent countries are summarized. New localities and host plants, and some corrections of misidentified species from Argentina are given. Distribution maps of all species in Argentina with known localities superimposed with biogeographic provinces are provided. The southern limits of Botanochara in western, central and eastern Argentina are established and correlates with the known distributions of Ipomoea L. species (Convolvulaceae). A total of 12,815 specimens of Cassidinae were found inside birds' nests from Argentina, from which 11,538 (90.03%) belong to 8 species of Botanochara; 9,331 (80.87%) were found during Autumn (21th March to 20th June) and Winter (21th June to 20th September) (diapause), and 2,207 (19.13%) during Spring (21 th September to 20 th December) and Summer (21 th December to 20 th March) (aseasonal quiescence).

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the predictive value of real-time myocardial contrast echocardiography (RT-MCE) in a preclinical canine model of ischemic cardiomyopathy who received CRT. Ischemic cardiomyopathy was produced by ligating the first diagonal branch in 20 beagles. Dogs were subsequently divided into two groups that were either treated with bi-ventricular pacing (CRT group) or left untreated (control group). RT-MCE was performed at baseline, before CRT, and 4 weeks after CRT. Two-dimensional speckle tracking imaging was used to evaluate the standard deviation of circumferential (Cir12SD), radial (R12SD), and longitudinal (L12SD) strains of left ventricular segments at basal as well as middle levels. Four weeks later, the Cir12SD, R12SD, and myocardial blood flow (MBF) of the treated group were significantly improved compared to their non-CRT counterparts. Furthermore, MBF values measured before CRT were significantly higher in responders than in non-responders to bi-ventricular pacing. Meanwhile, no significant differences were observed between the responder and nonresponder groups in terms of Cir12SD, R12SD, and L12SD. A high degree of correlation was found between MBF values before CRT and LVEF after CRT. When MBF value >24.9 dB/s was defined as a cut-off point before CRT, the sensitivity and specificity of RT-MCE in predicting the response to CRT were 83.3% and 100%, respectively. Besides, MBF values increased significantly in the CRT group compared with the control group after 4 weeks of pacing (49.8 +/- 15.5 dB/s vs. 28.5 +/- 4.6 dB/s, p<0.05). Therefore, we considered that myocardial perfusion may be superior to standard metrics of LV synchrony in selecting appropriate candidates for CRT. In addition, CRT can improve myocardial perfusion in addition to cardiac synchrony, especially in the setting of ischemic cardiomyopathy.

We investigated the phytotoxicity of pequi leaves added to substrate soil in quantities compatible with the litter produced by this species. Pequi leaves were triturated and added to red latosol in concentrations of 0.75%, 1.5% and 3%; the control was constituted of leafless soil. These mixtures were added to pots and irrigated daily to keep them moist. Germinated seeds of the cultivated sorghum and sesame, of the invasive brachiaria and of the native purple ipe, were disposed in the pots to grow for five to seven days at 30 degrees C within a photoperiod of 12 h. Seedlings of all the species presented a reduction in their initial growth in a dose-dependent way. In general, the root growth was more affected by the treatments than the shoot growth; moreover, signs of necrosis were observed in the roots of the sorghum, sesame and brachiaria. The phytotoxic effects generated by relatively small quantities of leaves, in a reasonable range of species within a soil substrate, suggest potential allelopathy of pequi leaves under natural conditions.

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of a warmer climate on the Colorado potato beetle in Europe, since temperature influences the beetles' activity and development from egg to adult, and thereby the potential distribution. The study focuses in particular on the potential northward spread in the Scandinavian countries. In this region, the current climate is not warm enough to sustain the completed development of one generation in all years, and the region does not host a permanent population. Temperature data for 1961-2050 from 4 regional climate models and gridded observed data for 1961-1990 (reference period) were used for model calculations. We simulated the earliest timing of completed development of the first and second generations of the Colorado potato beetle, and assessed the geographical and inter-annual variation in the number of generations per year. The model simulations indicated a shift in the northern limit for establishment of a permanent Colorado potato beetle population by 2020-2050 in comparison with 1961-1990. In particular, the model showed a substantial increase in the frequency of years in which the temperature requirement for development of one generation was fulfilled in the transient zone, i.e. the southern part of Scandinavia. In addition, 2 generations per year may occur more frequently at the current distribution border at 55 degrees N, increasing the risk of northward migration to the Scandinavian countries.

J	Widenfalk, LA; Ahrne, K; Berggren, A				Widenfalk, Lina A.; Ahrne, Karin; Berggren, Asa			Using citizen-reported data to predict distributions of two non-native insect species in Sweden	ECOSPHERE												Information on exotic species' current and potential distribution is vital for decisions on management. Species distribution models can predict where colonizations are likely; however, the collection of species' distribution data over large areas in order to parameterize the models is costly. Therefore, modelling methods that are able to use low-cost information such as citizen-reported data are potentially very useful. In this study, we used the species habitat modelling program Maxent to predict the potential geographical distribution of two non-native insect species in Sweden, the butterfly Araschnia levana and the shield bug Graphosoma lineatum. For this we used citizen-reported presence-only open-access data in combination with climate and land cover data from national databases. Our models showed that presence of A. levana was best predicted by winter temperature and habitats related to open grasslands. For G. lineatum, summer temperature and open green areas, in both urban and rural areas were the best predictors for species presence. These models show that large areas of non-colonized potential habitats exist within Sweden. For A. levana these yet-to-be-colonized habitats are mainly in the south, while for G. lineatum these habitats occur in the south and along the Baltic Sea coast. Comparisons of temporal patterns in species reporting for A. levana and G. lineatum to similar insects with known stable populations revealed large 'willingness to report' effects that could potentially bias range expansion rates. Once corrected for, current distribution expansion rates were estimated as 1.9 km/yr and 1.07 km/yr respectively. The study shows the use of public reports in conservation science as a way of gathering species information over large areas. This increases the data sources available for researchers to predict the distribution of species and have the additional value of the involvement of the public in conservation efforts.

A methodology and an optimization tool to calibrate phenology of short-day species included in the APSIM PLANT model: Application to soybean	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE												We developed a methodology and an optimization tool that simplifies calibration of the APSIM PLANT multi parameter input phenology module. The methodology and the tool were successfully applied to estimate phenological parameters for 40 soybean cultivars covering maturity groups from 00 to 6. Our approach utilized information on flowering, physiological maturity and soybean maturity group, and provided a complete set of phenological parameters for APSIM that accounted also for temperature x photoperiod interactions throughout the crop cycle. The model predicted flowering (root mean square error, RMSE = 3.1 d) and physiological maturity (RMSE = 5.5 d) very well in a range of environments across the USA (33-46 degrees N latitude, n = 280). The relative absolute error was below 3% in all cases indicating the robustness of our approach. The APSIM PLANT phenology module is generic, thus our approach can be applied to all the short-day species included in the modelling platform. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Resistance of 10 tomato cultivars ('Primoearly,"Riogrand,"CaljN3,"Kingstone,"Earlyurbana,"Petomech,' 'EarlyurbanaY,"Mobil,"Imprial' and 'Petoearly') to H. armigera was evaluated under laboratory conditions at 25 +/- 1 degrees C, 60 +/- 5% RH and a photoperiod of 16:8 (L:D) hours using age-stage, two-sex life table parameters. The larval period ranged from 19.96 on 'Riogrand' to 24.58 days on 'Imprial: The insects reared on 'Imprial' had the longest total preoviposition period (44.80 days) and those reared on 'Riogrand' had the shortest one (35.44 days). The longest adult longevity for female and male was observed on 'EarlyurbanaY' (14.40 days) and 'Kingstone' (15.00 days), respectively. Using age-stage, two-sex life table, the value of the net reproductive rate (R-0) varied from 7.8 on 'Imprial' to 186.9 offspring per individual on Tetomech: The lowest value of the intrinsic rate of increase (r) and finite rate of increase (lambda) was on 'Imprial' (0.0410 and 1.0423 day(-1), respectively) and the highest was on 'Petomech' (0.1274 and 1.1359 day(-1), respectively). The mean generation time (T) on different cultivars varied from 39.9 to 48.2 days. The results revealed that 'Petomech' was the most susceptible (suitable) and 'Imprial' was the most resistant (unsuitable) cultivar to this pest among the tomato cultivars tested.

For species possessing low-dispersing, non feeding larvae, population demographics and distributions are primarily regulated by larval production and post-settlement effects. This study assessed the effect of temperature, photoperiod, rainfall and habitat on post-settlement mortality, growth, asexual reproduction (fission), larval production and recruitment in the abundant Great Barrier Reef brooding sponge Carteriospongia foliascens. The study was conducted over 24 months at two locations characterized by distinct hydrodynamics (wave height). Location-specific differences in growth, body size and fecundity for C foliascens were attributed to water movement, with a higher wave height range corresponding to higher abundance of larger, more reproductive individuals. The positive effects of hydrodynamics on growth and larval production also translated to higher recruitment levels highlighting a stock-recruitment relationship in this species. C. foliascens showed no evidence of fission, and exhibited fluctuating growth trajectories in all size classes investigated. Decreasing growth variability corresponded with increasing size, reflecting growth trajectories for species having indeterminate growth. Results presented in this study highlight the importance of habitat characteristics for post-settlement processes, larval production and recruitment in low dispersing sessile invertebrate species, such as brooding sponges.

J	Reiser, S; Herrmann, JP; Temming, A				Reiser, Stefan; Herrmann, Jens-Peter; Temming, Axel			Thermal preference of the common brown shrimp (Crangon crangon, L.) determined by the acute and gravitational method	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Temperature is of critical importance for ectotherms, having vast impacts on physiology, behavior and distribution. In many species, however, the behavioral component of temperature selection is not well understood. This study addresses the thermoregulatory behavior of the common brown shrimp (Crangon crangon, L.), which is a central component of the Wadden Sea ecosystem and an important fishery resource of high commercial value. To investigate whether brown shrimp are thermosensitive and perform behavioral thermoregulation, we examined the short- and long-term thermoregulatory behavior by using the acute and gravitational method for temperature preference testing. For the acute method, female adult brown shrimp were acclimated to 5 temperatures between 9 degrees C and 19 degrees C for two weeks. For the gravitational method, the shrimp were acclimated to 3 temperatures within the same range. Hereafter, thermal preferenda were determined in an annular shaped preference chamber. Acute and gravitational thermal preference experiments revealed brown shrimp to be thermosensitive and perform behavioral thermoregulation. Using the acute method, a positive correlation of acclimation and preferred temperature was observed, resulting in a final thermal preferendum of 15.9 degrees C. In experiments using the gravitational method, preference temperature was heavily modulated by the photoperiod, with brown shrimp selecting temperatures more precisely during the scotophase than the photophase. Determined at dark exclusively, however, no effect of acclimation temperature on gravitational preference after 24 and 48 h was observed. Preferenda ranged between 13.5-15.0 degrees C after 24 h and 12.0-14.9 degrees C after 48 h, respectively, and no significant differences between both methods were detected. Based on these findings, 20-24 h of gradient exposure can be considered sufficient to obtain thermal preferenda that are unaffected by the animal's prior thermal history. Thermal preferenda determined in the present study were higher than the average temperature experienced by brown shrimp in the field. Still, thermal preferenda were considerably lower than previously reported optimum temperatures for brown shrimp. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Each of these events needs the hormone's action and requirement for carbohydrates is the common denominator. In Diptera, carbohydrates are taken up during feeding by action of the cibarial pump and are then stored in the crop. Using adult Phormia regina, both a bioassay and electrophysiological recordings show that Phote-HrTH slows down or inhibits the crop lobe muscles (P5) and, at the same time, stimulates the muscles of the pump 4 (P4) involved in pushing fluids out of the crop and up into the midgut for digestion. The EC50 for P4 was in the nanomolar range while the IC50 for P5 was 1.4-75.1 pM. The effect of Phote-HrTH on P4/5 suggests that the peptide is important in coordinating the two pumps, which are involved in moving carbohydrates up into the midgut for digestion. The adult crop organ is an essential storage organ for carbohydrates and now should be considered an important structure capable of delivering nutrients to the midgut for digestion.

J	Huestis, DL; Lehmann, T				Huestis, Diana L.; Lehmann, Tovi			Ecophysiology of Anopheles gambiae s.l.: Persistence in the Sahel	INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION												The dry-season biology of malaria vectors is poorly understood, especially in arid environments when no surface waters are available for several months, such as during the dry season in the Sahel. Here we reappraise results on the dry-season physiology of members of the Anopheles gambiae s.l. complex in the broad context of dormancy in insects and especially in mosquitoes. We examine evidence on seasonal changes in reproduction, metabolism, stress tolerance, nutrition, molecular regulation, and environmental conditions and determine if the current results are compatible with dry-season diapause (aestivation) as the primary strategy for persistence throughout the dry season in the Sahel. In the process, we point out critical gaps in our knowledge that future studies can fill. We find compelling evidence that members of the An. gambiae s.l. complex undergo a form of aestivation during the Sahelian dry season by shifting energetic resources away from reproduction and towards increased longevity. Considering the differences between winter at temperate latitudes, which entails immobility of the insect and hence reliance on physiological solutions, as opposed to the Sahelian dry season, which restricts reproduction exclusively, we propose that behavioral changes play an important role in complementing physiological changes in this strategy.

Variation in two phases of post-winter development of a butterfly	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY												The temporal aspects of life cycle characteristics, such as diapause development, are under strong selection in seasonal environments. Fine-tuning of the life cycle may be particularly important to match the phenology of potential mates and resources as well as for optimizing abiotic conditions at eclosion. Here, we experimentally study the spring phenology of the orange tip butterfly, Anthocharis cardamines, by analysing post-winter pupal development in three populations along a latitudinal cline in each of Sweden and the United Kingdom. These countries differ substantially in their seasonal temperature profile. By repeatedly recording pupal weights, we established that post-winter development has two separate phases, with a more rapid weight loss in the second phase than in the first, likely corresponding to a ramping up of the rate of development. Variation in the duration of the first phase contributed more strongly than the second phase to the differences in phenology between the localities and sexes. We found that insects from Sweden had a faster overall rate of development than those from the United Kingdom, which is consistent with countergradient variation, as Sweden is colder during the spring than the United Kingdom. Similar trends were not observed at the within-country scale, however. A cogradient pattern was found within Sweden, with populations from the north developing more slowly, and there was no clear latitudinal trend within the United Kingdom. In all localities, males developed faster than females. Our results point to the importance of variation in the progression of post-winter development for spring phenology.

Populations from higher latitudes often develop faster throughout the range of relevant temperatures (i.e countergradient variation) because they must be able to complete their life cycle within a shorter seasonal time window compared to populations at lower latitudes. In the present study, we experimentally demonstrate that two species of butterflies Anthocharis cardamines (L.) and Pieris napi (L.) instead show a cogradient variation in thermal reaction norms of post-winter pupal development so that lower latitude populations develop faster than higher latitude populations. The two species share host plants but differ in the degree of phenological specialization, as well as in the patterns of voltinism. We suggest that the pattern in A.cardamines, a univoltine phenological specialist feeding exclusively on flowers and seedpods, is the result of selection for matching to the phenological pattern of its local host plants. The other species, P.napi, is a phenological generalist feeding on the leaves of the hosts and it shows a latitudinal cline in voltinism. Because the latitudinal pattern in P.napi was an effect of slow development in a fraction of the pupae from the most northern population, we hypothesize that this population may include both bivoltine and univoltine genotypes. Consequently, although the two species both showed cogradient patterns in thermal reaction norms, it appears likely that this was for different reasons.(c) 2014 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2014, 113, 981-991.

Development, survivorship and reproduction of Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) under fluctuating temperatures	BULLETIN OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH												Laboratory studies were conducted to assess the effect of temperature on the survival, development, longevity and fecundity of Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) at eight different fluctuating temperatures with an amplitude +/- 9 degrees C under constant photoperiodic conditions of 16: 8h (L:D). H. armigera achieved complete development from egg to adult emergence between mean 17.5 and 32.5 degrees C. At mean 35 degrees C, all newly hatched larvae died and at mean 15 degrees C entered diapause at pupal stage. The lower developmental thresholds of the immature stages were estimated by a linear model and ranged from 4.63 degrees C (pupal stage) to 7.69 degrees C (egg stage). The developmental thresholds estimated by a nonlinear model were slightly higher than those estimated by the linear model. Adult longevity and fecundity were reduced at mean fluctuating temperatures 17.5 and 32.5 degrees C, but tended to be independent of the pattern of temperature change at moderate temperatures. The maximum reproductive performance, 1130 eggs per female, was observed at mean 25 degrees C. The intrinsic rates of increase were positive, meaning that H. armigera could be expected to persist or increase in number between mean 17.5 and 32.5 degrees C, with the maximum value at mean 27.5 degrees C. H. armigera survives, develops and reproduces within a wide range of fluctuating temperatures, while it completes the above functions with different levels of success at different mean temperatures of diurnal variation. Comparison of our results with similar data from the literature involving constant conditions is discussed. This information will provide a better understanding of H. armigera phenology and population dynamics under natural conditions and is essential to understanding the ecological and evolutionary consequences of climate change on this important species.																	0007-4853	1475-2670				DEC	2014	104	6					751	764		10.1017/S0007485314000595								WOS:000344945700009	25208831

Effect of temperature on the phenology of Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) (Lepidoptera, Crambidae); simulation and visualization of the potential future distribution of C. partellus in Africa under warmer temperatures through the development of life-table parameters	BULLETIN OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH												Maize (Zea mays) is a major staple food in Africa. However, maize production is severely reduced by damage caused by feeding lepidopteran pests. In East and Southern Africa, Chilo partellus is one of the most damaging cereal stem borers mainly found in the warmer lowland areas. In this study, it was hypothesized that the future distribution and abundance of C. partellus may be affected greatly by the current global warming. The temperature-dependent population growth potential of C. partellus was studied on artificial diet under laboratory conditions at six constant temperatures (15, 18, 20, 25, 28, 30, 32 and 35 degrees C), relative humidity of 75 +/- 5% and a photoperiod of L12:L12 h. Several non-linear models were fitted to the data to model development time, mortality and reproduction of the insect species. Cohort updating algorithm and rate summation approach were stochastically used for simulating age and stage structure populations and generate life-table parameters. For spatial analysis of the pest risk, three generic risk indices (index of establishment, generation number and activity index) were visualized in the geographical information system component of the advanced Insect Life Cycle modeling (ILCYM) software. To predict the future distribution of C. partellus we used the climate change scenario A1B obtained from WorldClim and CCAFS databases. The maps were compared with available data on the current distribution of C. partellus in Kenya. The results show that the development times of the different stages decreased with increasing temperatures ranging from 18 to 35 degrees C; at the extreme temperatures, 15 and 38 degrees C, no egg could hatch and no larvae completed development. The study concludes that C. partellus may potentially expands its range into higher altitude areas, highland tropics and moist transitional regions, with the highest maize potential where the species has not been recorded yet. This has serious implication in terms of food security since these areas produce approximately 80% of the total maize in East Africa.

Patterns of parasitoid host utilization and development across a range of temperatures: implications for biological control of an invasive forest pest	BIOCONTROL												Although climate change frequently has been linked to observed shifts in the distributions or phenologies of species, little is known about the potential effects of varying temperatures on parasitoids and their relationships with hosts. Using the egg parasitoid Oobius agrili (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) we examined host utilization patterns of this species across a range of temperatures (20-35 A degrees C) to explore how changing climate could affect the interaction with its host-the emerald ash borer (EAB) (Coleoptera: Buprestidae), a serious invasive forest pest that has killed tens of millions of ash (Fraxinus spp.) trees in North America. Results from our study showed that the window of host susceptibility to O. agrili parasitism declined significantly from 14.8 to 2.6 days in an inverse second-order relationship with increasing exposure temperatures from 20 to 35 A degrees C. In contrast, parasitoid host attack rate changed in a bell-shaped second-order relationship-i.e., increased with temperatures from 20 to 25 A degrees C, but decreased at about the same rate when temperatures increased from 30 to 35 A degrees C. This range of temperatures also significantly affected the development and mortality of immature parasitoids with 35 A degrees C resulting in 100 % mortality. There was little mortality (0-4.5 %) and no significant differences in the percentage (20.9-34.9 %) of immature O. agrili that entered diapause (as mature larvae) at 20, 25, and 30 A degrees C. However, there were significant differences in the time event of adult wasp emergence within this temperature range. The median time for 50 % of immature O. agrili emerging as adults at 20, 25, and 30 A degrees C were 38, 18, and 17 days after parental wasp oviposition, respectively. Together these findings indicate that the non-linear and unequal temperature effects on these host utilization parameters are likely to result in differential host parasitism rates, and thus could reduce the efficacy of this parasitoid in suppressing host populations due to climate change (global warming and extreme heat).

In this model, intracellular carbon and nitrogen are both divided into a functional pool and a storage pool. An internal pool that explicitly describes the nitrogenase enzyme is also added. The various intracellular carbon and nitrogen flows between these pools lead to a complex dynamics driven by the light regime. The model is successfully validated with continuous cultures experiments of C. watsonii under three light regimes, indicating that the proposed mechanisms accurately reproduce the growth dynamics of this organism under various light environments. Then, a series of model simulations is run for a range of light regimes with different photoperiods and daily light doses. Results reveal how nitrogen and carbon are coupled, through the diel cycle, along with nitrogenase dynamics whose activity is constrained by the light regime. In an ecological perspective, we picture the effect of such irradiance condition on growth and on the carbon to nitrogen stoichiometry on cells. This model could prove useful to understand the latitudinal distribution of this cyanobacterium in the global ocean. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DVM depth and migration patterns depend on oceanographic conditions with respect to temperature, light and oxygen availability at depth, factors that are highly dependent on season in most marine regions. Here we introduce a global krill respiration ANN (artificial neural network) model including the effect of latitude (LAT), the day of the year (DoY), and the number of daylight hours (DLh), in addition to the basal variables that determine ectothermal oxygen consumption (temperature, body mass and depth). The newly implemented parameters link space and time in terms of season and photoperiod to krill respiration. The ANN model showed a better fit (r(2) = 0.780) when DLh and LAT were included, indicating a decrease in respiration with increasing LAT and decreasing DLh. We therefore propose DLh as a potential variable to consider when building physiological models for both hemispheres. For single Euphausiid species investigated in a large range of DLh and DoY, we also tested the standard respiration rate for seasonality with Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and General Additive model (GAM). GAM successfully integrated DLh (r(2) = 0.563) and DoY (r(2) = 0.572) effects on respiration rates of the Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, yielding the minimum metabolic activity in mid-June and the maximum at the end of December. We could not detect DLh or DoY effects in the North Pacific krill Euphausia pacifica, and our findings for the North Atlantic krill Meganyctiphanes norvegica remained inconclusive because of insufficient seasonal data coverage. We strongly encourage comparative respiration measurements of worldwide Euphausiid key species at different seasons to improve accuracy in ecosystem modeling. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Invasive black spiny-tailed iguanas (Ctenosaura similis) on Gasparilla Island, Florida, USA	INTEGRATIVE ZOOLOGY												The native range of Ctenosaura similis extends from southern Mexico through Panama. From an initial introduction of 3 animals in 1979, the species now numbers in the thousands on Gasparilla Island in southwest Florida. In response to complaints of property damage from residents and threats to native species, local officials and the US Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services began a removal program in 2008. Through 2011, trappers removed 9467 ctenosaurs. The number removed declined from 32 iguanas/day in 2008 to 1.9 iguanas/day in 2011 despite no easing of the control effort. We necropsied 2757 ctenosaurs to document aspects of their natural history. Females outnumbered males overall, although the largest size class (>300 mm snout-vent length) included 32 males and just 2 females. Reproduction was seasonal. We found oviducal eggs in females from early Apr to early Jun, approximately 2 months later than C. similis in its native range. We trapped hatchlings from late Jul to early Oct coincident with the summer rainy season. Clutch size increased with female body size, with 62 being the largest clutch size recorded. In general, the biology of the invasive population on Gasparilla Island resembles native C. similis populations in Central America, except for the lack of large individuals. We suggest that shorter day length and colder temperatures create environmental conditions that are suboptimal for individual growth compared to those in the native range.																	1749-4877	1749-4869				NOV	2014	9	5					590	597		10.1111/1749-4877.12085								WOS:000345695200005	24382291

We found that the number of days required for nymphal development decreased with increasing latitude, suggesting that shorter periods of warm temperatures in the north resulted in faster development. Body size varied between populations, and followed the converse to Bergmann's rule, indicating that limited development time at higher latitudes resulted in smaller body size. Wing dimorphism in V. micado was influenced by both photoperiod and latitude. A higher proportion of macropters occurred under longer photoperiod conditions, suggesting that wing dimorphism in V. micado was the result of seasonal adaptation. The critical photoperiod was shorter for the southern populations than that for the northern populations, and the incidence of macroptery decreased with increasing latitude, suggesting that wing dimorphism in V. micado correlated with climatic variation.

J	Prabhakaran, PM; Sheeba, V				Prabhakaran, Priya M.; Sheeba, Vasu			Temperature sensitivity of circadian clocks is conserved across Drosophila species melanogaster, malerkotliana and ananassae	CHRONOBIOLOGY INTERNATIONAL												Light and temperature are the major environmental cycles that can synchronize circadian rhythms in a variety of organisms. Previously, we have shown that under light/dark cycles of various photoperiods, the Drosophila species ananassae exhibits unimodal activity pattern with a prominent morning activity peak in contrast with Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila malerkotliana, which show bimodal activity pattern with morning and evening activity peaks. Here we report that circadian clocks controlling activity/rest rhythm of these two less-studied species D. malerkotliana and D. ananassae can be synchronized by temperature cycles and that even under temperature cycles D. ananassae exhibits only a pronounced morning (thermophase onset) activity peak. Although D. melanogaster and D. ananassae exhibit differences in the phase of activity/rest rhythm under temperature cycles, circadian clocks of both show similar sensitivity to warm temperature pulses. Circadian period of activity/rest rhythm of D. ananassae differs from the other two species at some moderate-range temperatures; however, in conditions that are more extreme, circadian clocks of D. melanogaster, D. malerkotliana and D. ananassae appear to be largely temperature compensated.					sheeba, vasu/0000-0003-2924-7130												0742-0528	1525-6073				NOV	2014	31	9					1008	1016		10.3109/07420528.2014.941471								WOS:000345237600007	25051431

Seed smell is, however, strongly correlated with seed water content, and hard seeds are therefore olfactionally cryptic to foraging rodents. This is the rationale for the crypsis hypothesis, which proposes that the primary functions of hard seeds are to reduce seed predation and promote rodent seed dispersal. We use a mechanistic model to describe seed survival success of plants with different dimorphic soft and hard seed strategies. The model is based on established empirical-ecological relationships of moisture requirements for germination and benefits of seed dispersal, and on experimentally demonstrated relationships between seed volatile emission, predation and predator escape. We find that water-impermeable seed coats can reduce seed predation under a wide range of natural humidity conditions. Plants with rodent dispersed seeds benefit from producing dimorphic soft and hard seeds at ratios where the anti-predator advantages of hard seeds are balanced by the dispersal benefits gained by producing some soft seeds. The seed pathway predicted from the model is similar to those of experimental seed-tracking studies. This validates the relevance and realism of the ecological mechanisms and relationships incorporated in the model.Synthesis. Rodent seed predators are often also important seed dispersers and have the potential to exert strong selective pressures on seeds to evolve methods of avoiding detection, and hard seeds seem to do just that. This work suggests that water-impermeable hard seeds may evolve in the absence of a dormancy function and that optimal seed survival in many environments with rodent seed predators is obtained by plants having a dimorphic soft and hard seed strategy.

Embryonic diapause in the Australian plague locust relative to parental experience of cumulative photophase decline	JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY												The Australian plague locust Chortoicetes termimfera (Walker) exhibits facultative embryonic diapause during autumn. To approximate natural photoperiod changes during late summer and autumn, locust nymphs were reared under different total declines in laboratory photophase (-0.5, -0.75, -1.0, -1.25, -1.5, -1.75, 2 h each lowered in 15 min steps) in a 24 h photoperiod to quantify any effect on the subsequent production of diapause eggs. Induction of diapause eggs was significantly affected by accumulated photoperiod decline experienced by the parental generation throughout all development stages from mid-instar nymph to fledgling adult. The incidence of embryonic diapause ranged from nil at -0.5 h to 86.6% diapause at -2 h. Continued declines in photoperiod for post-teneral locusts (transitioned from 1 h until fledging to -1.75 h) produced a further increase in the proportion of diapause eggs. The results were unaffected by time spent at any given photoperiod, despite a previously indicated maximal inductive photoperiod of 13.5 h being used as the mid-point of all treatments. Implications for the seasonal timing processes of photoperiodism in C. terminifera, which has a high migratory capacity and a latitudinal dine in the timing of diapause egg production across a broad geographic range, are discussed.

The amount of HSP70s is different under different environmental stresses. In this study, inducible heat shock protein 70 and its constitutive heat shock cognate 70 were cloned by RT-PCR and RACE. These genes were named Lg-hsp70 and Lg-hsc70, respectively. Gene transcription and protein expression after cold stress treatment (5 degrees C to -5 degrees C) were analyzed by western blotting and by qRT-PCR for four populations that were sampled in the northeast region of China, including Shenyang, Gongzhuling, Harbin and Heihe, when the soybean pod borer was in diapause. As the cold shock temperature decreased, the levels of Lg-HSP70s were significantly up-regulated. The amount of cold-induced Lg-HSP70s was highest in the southernmost population (Shenyang, 41 degrees 50'N) and lowest in the northernmost population (Heihe, 50 degrees 22'N). These results support the hypothesis that the soybean pod borer in the northeast region of China displays phenotypic plasticity, and the accumulation of Lg-HSP70s is a strategy for overcoming environmental stress. These results also suggest that the induction of HSP70 synthesis, which is a complex physiological adaptation, can evolve quickly and inherit stability.																	1932-6203					OCT 15	2014	9	10							e109465	10.1371/journal.pone.0109465								WOS:000346766200033	25330365					
J	Fu, Y; Zhang, HC; Dong, WJ; Yuan, WP				Fu, Yang; Zhang, Haicheng; Dong, Wenjie; Yuan, Wenping			Comparison of Phenology Models for Predicting the Onset of Growing Season over the Northern Hemisphere	PLOS ONE												Vegetation phenology models are important for examining the impact of climate change on the length of the growing season and carbon cycles in terrestrial ecosystems. However, large uncertainties in present phenology models make accurate assessment of the beginning of the growing season (BGS) a challenge. In this study, based on the satellite-based phenology product (i.e. the V005 MODIS Land Cover Dynamics (MCD12Q2) product), we calibrated four phenology models, compared their relative strength to predict vegetation phenology; and assessed the spatial pattern and interannual variability of BGS in the Northern Hemisphere. The results indicated that parameter calibration significantly influences the models' accuracy. All models showed good performance in cool regions but poor performance in warm regions. On average, they explained about 67% (the Growing Degree Day model), 79% (the Biome-BGC phenology model), 73% (the Number of Growing Days model) and 68% (the Number of Chilling Days-Growing Degree Day model) of the BGS variations over the Northern Hemisphere. There were substantial differences in BGS simulations among the four phenology models. Overall, the Biome-BGC phenology model performed best in predicting the BGS, and showed low biases in most boreal and cool regions. Compared with the other three models, the two-phase phenology model (NCD-GDD) showed the lowest correlation and largest biases with the MODIS phenology product, although it could catch the interannual variations well for some vegetation types. Our study highlights the need for further improvements by integrating the effects of water availability, especially for plants growing in low latitudes, and the physiological adaptation of plants into phenology models.																	1932-6203					OCT 3	2014	9	10							e109544	10.1371/journal.pone.0109544								WOS:000342670800090	25279567					
J	Stankowski, S				Stankowski, Sean			The density of empty shells, not habitat cover or quality, predicts the density of live Rhagada snails	MOLLUSCAN RESEARCH												Camaenid land snails are often the focus of targeted biodiversity surveys in Australia, but can be difficult to locate because they hibernate for most of the year. Searches would be more effective if the density of live snails could be predicted from features of the habitat, or from the abundance of empty shells from long dead individuals. In 53 populations of Rhagada, the dominant genus of land snail in the Pilbara bioregion of Western Australia, the density of live snails is not correlated with the cover or height of spinifex (Triodia), the main habitat plant occupied by Rhagada. On the other hand, the density of empty shells on the soil surface does explain snail population density, but the relationship is weak (r(2)=0.209). Nevertheless, the data suggest that searches for live Rhagada are more likely to succeed in areas where empty shells are most abundant.																	1323-5818	1448-6067				OCT 2	2014	34	4					274	276		10.1080/13235818.2014.888983								WOS:000344558300004

We tested hypotheses on the relationship between species richness and environmental conditions including environmental extremes, nutrient status, and day length. On the basis of the unique environment that exists in these high-latitude lakes, we expected that novel taxa would be present. Alpha diversity analyses showed that extreme conditions-that is, high salinity, low oxygen, and extreme changes in day length-did not impact ciliate richness; however, ciliate richness was 30% higher in samples with higher dissolved organic matter. Beta diversity analyses revealed that ciliate communities clustered by dissolved oxygen, depth, and salinity, but not by season (i.e., day length). The permutational analysis of variance test indicated that depth, dissolved oxygen, and salinity had significant influences on the ciliate community for the abundance matrices of resampled data, while lake and season were not significant. This result suggests that the vertical trends in dissolved oxygen concentration and salinity may play a critical role in structuring ciliate communities. A PCR-based strategy capitalizing on divergent eukaryotic V9 hypervariable region ribosomal RNA gene targets unveiled two new genera in these lakes. A novel taxon belonging to an unknown class most closely related to Cryptocaryon irritans was also inferred from separate gene phylogenies.

The main cause of death was predation (76%), but 18% was due to roadkill. The majority of females (89%) oviposited; all five females observed in both years oviposited in each year. The active season was similar to 200 days with snakes emerging in early April and retreating to hibernation sites in late September. Taken altogether, in suitable habitats, these northern populations of Gophersnakes occurred at high density with high reproductive rates and very low overwinter mortality.																	2151-0733	1931-7603				OCT	2014	9	2					246	256										WOS:000343398400002						
J	Smith, L				Smith, Lincoln			Prediction of the Geographic Distribution of the Psyllid, Arytinnis hakani (Homoptera: Psyllidae), a Prospective Biological Control Agent of Genista monspessulana, Based on the Effect of Temperature on Development, Fecundity, and Survival	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												The psyllid, Arytinnis hakani (Loginova), is a prospective biological control agent of Genista monspessulana (French broom), an invasive shrub originating from western Europe. It is a multivoltine species that is not known to diapause. The insect is established in Australia, where it appears to cause heavy defoliation and mortality of the target weed, except at warm sunny sites. This suggests that bright light or high temperatures may hamper the agent. We measured the effect of temperature on development rate, survival, and fecundity of the psyllid to determine its suitable temperature range. Intrinsic rate of increase was highest near 22 degrees C, and there was no population growth at the extremes of 5 degrees C and 26 degrees C. Net reproductive rate was highest at 16.5 degrees C. Fecundity was highest at 22 degrees C, and decreased to half at 16 degrees C and at 27 degrees C. Adult female longevity decreased with increasing temperature over the range studied. Nymphal survivorship was highest at 16 degrees C and dropped to 0% at 5 degrees C and 26 degrees C. Eggs were able to complete development in 83 d at 5 degrees C, but with only 20% survivorship versus 78-95% survivorship at higher temperatures. For populations with a stable age distribution, only 2 3% of the population is in the adult stage. Climate modeling using CLIMEX indicated that the geographic distribution of the psyllid is constrained by high temperature stress in Australia. The psyllid is predicted to be suitable in coastal California but not in the Sierra foothills.																	0046-225X	1938-2936				OCT	2014	43	5					1389	1398		10.1603/EN14086								WOS:000343216400027	25199116

A. glabripennis overwinters as dormant larvae to avoid adverse environmental conditions. To elucidate the cold hardiness of A. glabripennis larvae, the supercooling point (SCP), freezing point (FP), and cold hardiness-related compounds were examined in overwintering larva from five populations in China (Yili, Yanchi, Wulateqianqi, Beijing, and Dezhou). The results showed that the SCP and FP differed significantly among populations, where the SCP of larvae in the Wulateqianqi population was the lowest and highest in the Beijing population. The water, fat, and glycogen contents also differed significantly among the five populations. The SCPs of larvae from all five populations were proportional to glycogen contents, but had no association with water contents and fat contents. The total contents of seven low-molecular weight compounds (glycerol, galactose, glucose, mannose, sorbitol, inositol, and trehalose) differed significantly among populations. Thus, A. glabripennis larvae from different geographical populations contained different sugars or sugar alcohols (especially glycerol, glucose, sorbitol, and trehalose), which helped them to resist cold temperatures. This study provides basic information about that may facilitate the prediction of distribution range expansions and ensure proper implementation of the integrated management of A. glabripennis populations.																	0046-225X	1938-2936				OCT	2014	43	5					1419	1426		10.1603/EN13352								WOS:000343216400030	25202887

Beyond seasonal climate: statistical estimation of phenological responses to weather	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Phenological events, such as the timing of flowering or insect emergence, are influenced by a complex combination of climatic and non-climatic factors. Although temperature is generally considered most important, other weather events such as frosts and precipitation events can also influence many species' phenology. Non-climatic variables such as photoperiod and site-specific habitat characteristics can also have important effects on phenology. Forecasting phenological shifts due to climate change requires understanding and quantifying how these multiple factors combine to affect phenology. However, current approaches to analyzing phenological data have a limited ability for quantifying multiple drivers simultaneously. Here, we use a novel statistical approach to estimate the combined effects of multiple variables, including local weather events, on the phenology of several taxa (a tree, an insect, and a fungus). We found that thermal forcing had a significant positive effect on each species, frost events delayed the phenology of the tree and butterfly, and precipitation had a positive effect on fungal fruiting. Using data from sites across latitudinal gradients, we found that these effects are remarkably consistent across sites once latitude and other site effects are accounted for. This consistency suggests an underlying biological response to these variables that is not commonly estimated using data from field observations. This approach's flexibility will be useful for forecasting ongoing phenological responses to changes in climate variability in addition to seasonal trends.																	1051-0761	1939-5582				OCT	2014	24	7					1793	1802		10.1890/13-1533.1								WOS:000342859800017	29210238					
J	Althoff, DM; Fox, KA; Frieden, T				Althoff, David M.; Fox, Kelly A.; Frieden, Tal			The role of ecological availability and host plant characteristics in determining host use by the bogus yucca moth Prodoxus decipiens	ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												1. Specialisation in host plant use is strongly correlated with speciation in many plant-feeding insects. Specialised taxa, however, could be restricted in host range due to limits in ecological availability of host plant species rather than trade-offs in using alternate host species. 2. Moths in the genus Prodoxus are extreme specialists on Yucca and speciation is closely tied to host plant shifts. However, many Yucca ranges are allopatric. This study examined whether the bogus yucca moth Prodoxus decipiens is limited in host range because of biogeographic factors or due to differences in the characteristics of host plant species. 3. In a common garden, local P. decipiens moths that use Yucca filamentosa were exposed to individuals of five Yucca species, two that are known hosts of P. decipiens in other parts of its range and three that are used by its sister species, Prodoxus quinquepunctellus. 4. Local moths were attracted to flowers of all Yucca species and females attempted oviposition in the flowering stalks of all species. However, larvae successfully completed development to diapause in only one of the five host plant species. Larval development on non-natal Yucca species was significantly reduced compared with the local host. 5. The results suggest that differences in host plant characteristics among Yucca species would result in strong natural selection during a host shift. Thus, specialisation in host plant use is probably due to trade-offs involved with using novel host plant species as well as ecological availability.																	0307-6946	1365-2311				OCT	2014	39	5					620	626		10.1111/een.12141								WOS:000342982000011

We reared ten bivoltine silkworm strains (c10, g32, k06, n25, p21, p22, p24, p44, p50 and p63) under various thermal and light conditions and examined the incidence of embryonic diapause in the next generation to identify strains in which the incidence of diapause can be controlled within the range of 0 to 100% by adjusting a single ambient parameter. Some strains were clearly destined towards either diapause or direct development. The diapause incidence in the c10, p22 and p50 strains was controlled by temperature during the egg stage (0% at 18 degrees C and 100% at 25 degrees C), that in the p50 strain was also determined to be dependent on illumination during the egg stage (0% under continuous darkness and 100% under continuous illumination), and photoperiod during the larval stage regulated diapause in p44 and p50 (0% and 100% under long-day and short-day photoperiod, respectively), when all other external parameters remained constant under each experimental condition. These diapause-controllable silkworm strains might serve as model systems for studies of insect diapause, especially for the differential screening of related factors.																	1343-8786	1479-8298				OCT	2014	17	4					396	399		10.1111/ens.12073								WOS:000342900900005

A genetic analysis of diapause in crosses of a southern and a northern strain of the cabbage beetle Colaphellus bowringi (Coleoptera: chrysomelidae)	BULLETIN OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH												As a consequence of geographical variation in diapause mechanism in the cabbage beetle, Colaphellus bowringi, the southern strains enter diapause as an adult in response to long photoperiod, whereas the northern strains enter diapause in response to temperature. In the present study, we examined the inheritance of diapause by crossing a southern Xiushui strain (XS) with a most-northern Harbin strain (HB). The southern XS strain showed a clear short-day response for the induction of diapause, whereas the most-northern strain entered diapause regardless of photoperiod. Interestingly, the XS x HB progeny showed a short-day response, but the HB x XS progeny had no photoperiodic response, indicating that photoperiodic induction of diapause is influenced by maternal genotype. The incidence of diapause of F-1 progeny was intermediate between their parents under short daylengths of 12 and 13 h. However, there was a sexual asymmetry, with the female parent exerting a greater effect on diapause incidence than the male parent, indicating a sex linkage in the inheritance of diapause induction. The chi(2) test in C. bowringi revealed that the inheritance of diapause does not fit an additive hypothesis and also that the capacity for diapause is transmitted genetically (or possibly epigenetically) in a manner of incomplete dominance. These results suggest that a number of genetic factors are associated with differences in diapause capability in this beetle.																	0007-4853	1475-2670				OCT	2014	104	5					586	591		10.1017/S0007485314000352								WOS:000342200200005	24818998

Diapause incidence and duration in the pest mango blossom gall midge, Procontarinia mangiferae (Felt), on Reunion Island	BULLETIN OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH												The mango blossom gall midge, Procontarinia mangiferae, is a multivoltine species that induces galls in inflorescences and leaves of the mango tree, Mangifera indica. In subtropical Reunion Island, populations of P. mangiferae are observed all-year round, but the pattern and the role of dormancy in their life cycle have never been documented. We performed field and laboratory experiments using more than 15,000 larvae. We demonstrated that a larval diapause may affect a part of the midge population, regardless of the season. The total duration of the diapause varied from 6 weeks to more than 1 year. One year of field monitoring showed that the highest incidence of diapause was observed in larvae collected during the summer from mango leaves, where it affected approximately one-third of the individuals. This facultative diapause allows the permanent presence of P. mangiferae in the orchards. By recording diapause duration during 22 weeks under controlled conditions, we showed that high temperatures (26 degrees C) increased diapause duration and extended the range of the dates of diapause emergence, whereas cool temperatures (20 degrees C) shortened diapause duration and shortened the range of the dates of emergence from diapause. A temperature decrease from 26 to 20 degrees C triggered the emergence of diapausing individuals. These mechanisms ensure the synchronization of the emergence of diapausing individuals with the appearance of mango inflorescences, which is also induced by cool winter temperatures.

However, geographically separate populations of one species may respond variably. We analyzed egg laying dates of nine Eurasian populations of the Common Redstart Phoenicurus phoenicurus collected between 1969 and 2010. The timing of breeding differed greatly with latitude: the populations in the north started later, a breeding pair produced only one brood per season and the breeding season was shorter. Both yearly minimum and median first-egg laying dates advanced with increases in local air temperature, but the more northern populations had started at much lower temperatures, which was probably caused by the stimulation of photoperiod. The effects of large-scale climatic patterns (North Atlantic Oscillation, East Atlantic, Scandinavia/Eurasia-1) on the first-egg laying date were low. The egg laying dates advanced over the observed decades in all populations, although at a variable rate. Seven selected populations with the most complete data for the period 1986-2010 revealed an advancement of median first-egg laying dates of 0.11 days/year and 1.31 days/A degrees C. The effect on minimum first-egg laying dates was smaller. The changes observed in two populations in Ural and western Siberia were smaller than those found in more westerly populations (Finland, central Europe). The timing of the start of breeding is probably less affected by climate change than the timing of spring migration, documented by European ornithological stations.

An assessment of the developmental toxicity of BDE-99 in the European starling using an integrated laboratory and field approach	ECOTOXICOLOGY												Developmental exposure of wildlife to anthropogenic contaminants can have long-term effects that are difficult to assess in field monitoring studies, and may not be evident in laboratory studies that lack ecological components. The objective of this study was to assess the long-term effects of early exposure to contaminants under ecological conditions in a model passerine species, the European starling (Sturnus vulgaris). We selected 2,2',4,4',5-pentabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-99) as a representative contaminant, as it is one of the major constituents of the commercial penta-BDE flame retardant mixture, and has been reported in avian egg and tissue samples worldwide. We developed a novel approach to assess the developmental toxicity of BDE-99 in starlings by combining aspects of laboratory and field studies. We dosed free-living nestlings living in natural broods in the field with environmentally relevant concentrations of BDE-99 (0-173.8 ng/g bw/day) for the duration of the nesting cycle. To simulate monitoring of long-term effects we brought birds into captivity just prior to fledging and used photoperiod manipulations to induce reproductive development. We assessed a range of physiological and development measures such as hematocrit, oxidative stress, thyroid hormones, neuroanatomy, growth, molt rate, bill color, and testes development. We found some evidence of thyroid hormone disruption, but there were no effects on any other measures of physiology or development. The European starling could serve as a valuable model species for assessing early exposure and long-term effects of anthropogenic contaminants in terrestrial wildlife using this combined field/laboratory approach.

Previous studies on the migration of P. xylostella in China were mostly carried out in its 'year-round breeding region' (YBR) or 'winter diapause region' (WDR). However, the pattern of monthly movements in its 'summer breeding region' (SBR) (i.e. northern China, where they cannot overwinter) remains unknown. Here we present data from an 11-year study of P. xylostella made by searchlight trapping on Beihuang (BH) Island in the center of the Bohai Strait, which provides direct evidence that P. xylostella moths must have been migrants, and undertook regular long-distance migration across the sea. There was considerable annual and monthly variation in the number of P. xylostella trapped on BH, with the vast majority was trapped in the summer. The mean time from the earliest trapping to the latest trapping within a year was 117 +/- 19 d in the five mass-migration years, with the shortest time span of 51 d in 2005 and the longest of 157 d in 2010. Some females trapped in May and June showed a relatively higher proportion of having mated and a degree of ovarian development suggesting that the migration of this species is not completely bound by the 'oogenesis-flight syndrome'. These findings provide a good starting point of research on P. xylostella migration between its WDR (or YBR) and SBR, which will help us develop more effective regional management strategies against this pest.

Photoperiodic effects on diapause-associated gene expression trajectories in European Leptinotarsa decemlineata populations	INSECT MOLECULAR BIOLOGY												Behavioural and physiological changes during diapause, an important strategy of insects for surviving harsh seasonal conditions, have been intensively studied. The genetic and molecular mechanisms underpinning diapause development are less well known. We took a candidate gene approach to study prediapause gene expression patterns in the Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata), an invasive insect that has rapidly spread northwards to high seasonality environments. Newly eclosed beetles originating from southern (Italy) and northern (Russia) Europe were reared under short-[12 h light (L): 12 h dark (D)] and long-day (18L:6D) photoperiods for 10 days. This time period includes the sensitive period for the photoperiodic induction and initiation of diapause. Gene expression trajectories of 12 diapause-related genes (regulatory, metabolic and stress-resistance) were analysed from 0-, 5- and 10-day-old beetles. Gene expression differences increased with age, deviating significantly between populations and photoperiods in 10-day-old beetles. The gene expression profiles, particularly those related to energy metabolism and stress-resistance, indicate that beetles originating from Russia also prepare for diapause under the long-day photoperiod and show qualitative differences in the diapausing phenotype. Our study shows that population-dependent differences seen in behavioural and physiological traits connected with diapause in L. decemlineata are also evident in the expression trajectories of diapause-related genes.

L.; Kreyling, Juergen			Relative effects of temperature vs. photoperiod on growth and cold acclimation of northern and southern ecotypes of the grass Arrhenatherum elatius	ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY												Growth of perennial grasses in the fall represents a balance between an extended growing season and increased vulnerability to frost. Within species along latitudinal gradients, plants may exhibit ecotype-specific sensitivities to the temperature and photoperiod cues that influence cold acclimation. Therefore, it is unclear for a given latitude how climate warming will alter the timing and extent of cold acclimation, and thus vulnerability to frost events. We evaluated relative temperature and photoperiod sensitivities during simulated cold acclimation for two northern (Swedish) and two southern (Italian) ecotypes of the common forage grass Arrhenatherum elatius. Three temperature levels (Temp(low): 3 degrees C, TeMPhigh+low: 8 degrees C followed by 3 degrees C, and Temp(high): 8 degrees C) were crossed with 2 photoperiod levels (Photo(short): 6 h, and Photo(long): 12h) and administered to the plants for a three week acclimation period. All plants were then frozen at -8 degrees C for 1 d, and post-frost growth was measured after 3 weeks. Temp(high) and Photo(long) increased growth prior to frost, but resulted in decreased growth after frost. The effects of temperature on sugar concentration, biomass and flower presence depended on photoperiod, with temperature only influencing sugar concentration and flowering at Photo(short), while Photo(long) increased biomass only at the high temperature. The faster growth rate of southern A. elatius ecotypes before frost, in combination with sufficient cold acclimation, resulted in higher biomass accumulation after frost. The faster growth habit of southern ecotypes may be advantageous in accumulating higher summer biomass even after moderate frost events in the fall. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Photosynthetic responses to temperature-mediated dormancy induction in contrasting ecotypes of red-osier dogwood (Cornus sericea L.)	ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY												Dormancy development in plants is synchronized with the cessation of environmental conditions that favour plant growth. The timing of this response is important in trees for growth and survival. Woody plants, such as dogwood (Cornus sericea L) have evolved different ecotypes that are closely adapted to local climatic conditions, which are differentiated by irradiance, photoperiod and/or temperature. While short photoperiods are well known to play a key role in dormancy induction in northern ecotypes, low temperatures alone can by-pass the photoperiodic requirement. It is well established that the combination of low temperature and even low to moderate light intensities predispose plants to photoinhibition of photosynthesis. However, plants possess numerous photoprotective mechanisms to minimize photoinhibition including increased rates of photosynthesis as well as non-photochemical dissipation of excess excitation energy, a process involving xanthophyll cycle carotenoids. We used two ecotypes of dogwood, the northern ecotype of Northwest Territories (NWT 62 degrees N latitude) and the southern Utah, U.S.A. (42 degrees N latitude) ecotype, which exhibit differential responses to photoperiodic- and temperature-induced dormancy. These ecotypes were exposed to various combinations of photoperiod and low temperature treatments and monitored for photosynthetic and photoprotective processes as the plants entered dormancy. Our results demonstrate differential long- and short-term responses to photoinhibition at low temperatures between the two ecotypes. The northern ecotype was more tolerant to photoinhibition of photosynthesis than the southern ecotype potentially through a zeaxanthin-independent mechanism of photoprotection. Furthermore, anthocyanin accumulation may be involved in the LD-Cold treatment through putative sugar sensing mechanisms to trigger dormancy. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The development and survival of immature stages of the carambola fruit fly, Bactrocera carambolae Drew & Hancock, and the Asian papaya fruit fly, Bactrocera papayae Drew & Hancock, were compared at six constant temperatures of 15, 20, 25, 27, 30, and 35 degrees C, 70 +/- 5% relative humidity, and a photoperiod of 12:12 (L:D). The objectives were to determine the effect of temperature on the developmental stages for optimizing rearing and to understand the geographical pattern of occurrence of these fruit fly species. A strong and positive linear relationship was observed between temperature and developmental rate of immature stages of B. carambolae. Similarly, a strong and positive linear relationship was observed between temperature and developmental rate of B. papayae. A temperature summation model was used to estimate the lower threshold temperature and the thermal constant. Bactrocera papayae was significantly faster in development and higher in survival and appeared to be better adapted to low temperatures than B. carambolae, as it exhibited the lowest threshold temperatures at all immature stages.

The photoperiodic response curves in this planthopper showed a typical long-day response type with a critical daylength of approximately 11 h at 25 degrees C, 12 h at 22 and 20 degrees C and 12.5 h at 18 degrees C, and diapause induction was almost abrogated at 28 degrees C. The third stage was the most sensitive stage to photoperiod. The photoperiodic response curve at 20 degrees C showed a gradual decline in diapause incidence in ultra-long nights, and continuous darkness resulted in 100% development. The required number of days for a 50% response was distinctly different between the short-and long-night cycles, showing that the effect of one short night was equivalent to the effect of three long nights at 18 degrees C. The rearing day length of 12 h evoked a weaker intensity of diapause than did 10 and 11 h. The duration of diapause was significantly longer under the short daylength of 11 h than it was under the long daylength of 15 h. The optimal temperature for diapause termination was 26 and 28 degrees C. Chilling at 5 degrees C for different times did not shorten the duration of diapause but significantly lengthened it when chilling period was included. In autumn, 50% of the nymphs that hatched from late September to mid-October entered diapause in response to temperatures below 20 degrees C. The critical daylength in the field was between 12 h 10 min and 12 h 32 min (including twilight), which was nearly identical to the critical daylength of 12.5 h at 18 degrees C. In spring, overwintering nymphs began to emerge in early March-late March when the mean daily temperature rose to 10 degrees C or higher.																	1932-6203					SEP 4	2014	9	9							e107030	10.1371/journal.pone.0107030								WOS:000341271500109	25188306

We investigated the regulation by temperature of the aphid populations composed of Metopolophium dirhodum, Sitobion avenae, and Rhopalosiphum padi on winter wheat using a 24 years long time series data. We computed the sum of daily temperatures above 5 degrees C, the threshold temperature for aphid development, and the sum of daily temperatures within the [0(threshold for wheat development),5]degrees C interval. Applying Generalised Additive Model framework we tested influences of temperature history expressed via degree days before the start of the aphid immigration on the length of their occurrence. We aimed to estimate the magnitude and direction of this influence, and how far to the past before the start of the aphid season the temperature effect goes and then identify processes responsible for the effect. We fitted four models that differed in the way of correcting for abundance in the previous year and in specification of temperature effects. Abundance in the previous year did not affect the length of period of aphid population growth on wheat. The temperature effect on the period length increased up to 123 days before the start of the current season, i.e. when wheat completed vernalization. Increased sum of daily temperatures above 5 degrees C and the sum of daily temperatures within the [0,5]degrees C interval both shortened the length of period of aphid population growth. Stronger effect of the latter suggests that wheat can escape from aphid attacks if during winter temperatures range from 0 to 5 degrees C. The temperature influence was not homogeneous in time. The strongest effect of past temperature was about 50 to 80 and 90 to 110 days before the beginning of the current aphid season indicating important role of termination of aphid egg dormancy and egg hatching.

Factors Affecting Phage D29 Infection: A Tool to Investigate Different Growth States of Mycobacteria	PLOS ONE												Bacteriophages D29 and TM4 are able to infect a wide range of mycobacteria, including pathogenic and non-pathogenic species. Successful phage infection of both fast-and slow-growing mycobacteria can be rapidly detected using the phage amplification assay. Using this method, the effect of oxygen limitation during culture of mycobacteria on the success of phage infection was studied. Both D29 and TM4 were able to infect cultures of M. smegmatis and Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) grown in liquid with aeration. However when cultures were grown under oxygen limiting conditions, only TM4 could productively infect the cells. Cell attachment assays showed that D29 could bind to the cells surface but did not complete the lytic cycle. The ability of D29 to productively infect the cells was rapidly recovered (within 1 day) when the cultures were returned to an aerobic environment and this recovery required de novo RNA synthesis. These results indicated that under oxygen limiting conditions the cells are entering a growth state which inhibits phage D29 replication, and this change in host cell biology which can be detected by using both phage D29 and TM4 in the phage amplification assay.

J	Goggin, DE; Powles, SB				Goggin, Danica E.; Powles, Stephen B.			Fluridone: a combination germination stimulant and herbicide for problem fields?	PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE												BACKGROUND: Problem weeds in agriculture, such as Lolium rigidum Gaud., owe some of their success to their large and dormant seed banks, which permit germination throughout a crop-growing season. Dormant weed seed banks could be greatly depleted by application of a chemical that stimulates early-season germination and then kills the young seedlings. Fluridone, a phytoene desaturase-inhibiting herbicide that can also break seed dormancy, was assessed for its efficacy in this regard. RESULTS: The germination of fluridone-treated Lolium rigidum seeds was stimulated on soils with low organic matter, and almost 100% seedling mortality was observed, while the treatment was only moderately effective on a high-organic-matter potting mix. Seedlings from wheat, canola, common bean and chickpea seeds sown on fluridone-treated sandy loam were bleached and did not survive, but lupins and field peas grew normally. CONCLUSION: This proof-of-concept study with fluridone suggests that it may be possible to design safe and effective molecules that act as germination stimulants plus herbicides in a range of crop and soil types: a potentially novel way of utilising herbicides to stimulate seed bank germination and a valuable addition to an integrated weed management system.

As both photoperiod and growth season length change with latitude, species undergoing latitudinal range expansion often need to synchronize their life cycle with a changing photoperiod and growth season length. Since adaptive synchronization often involves a large number of time-consuming genetic changes, behavioural plasticity might be a faster way to adjust to novel conditions. We compared behavioural and physiological traits in overwintering (diapause) preparation in three latitudinally different European Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata) populations reared under two photoperiods. Our aim was to study whether behavioural plasticity could play a role in rapid range expansion into seasonal environments. Our results show that while burrowing into the soil occurred in the southernmost studied population also under a non-diapause-inducing long photoperiod, the storage lipid content of these beetles was very low compared to the northern populations. However, similar behavioural plasticity was not found in the northern populations. Furthermore, the strongest suppression of energy metabolism was seen in pre-diapause beetles from the northernmost population. These results could indicate accelerated diapause preparation and possibly energetic adjustments due to temporal constraints imposed by a shorter, northern, growth season. Our results indicate that behavioural plasticity in burrowing may have facilitated initial range expansion of L. decemlineata in Europe. However, long-term persistence at high latitudes has required synchronization of burrowing behaviour with physiological traits. The results underline that eco-physiological life-history traits of insects, such as diapause, should be included in studies on range expansion.

In particular, the capability of dealing with environmental stress to buffer detrimental effects on fitness is considered to be of pivotal importance. Resistance traits are readily modulated by a wide range of environmental factors. In the present study, Drosophila melanogaster Meigen is used to investigate plastic responses to temperature and photoperiod in stress resistance traits. The results reveal that stress resistance traits (cold, heat, starvation and desiccation resistance) are affected by the factors temperature and sex predominantly. Cooler temperatures compared with warmer temperatures increase cold tolerance, desiccation and starvation resistance, whereas they reduce heat tolerance. Except for heat resistance, females are more stress-resistant than males. Stress resistance traits are also affected by photoperiod. Shorter photoperiods decrease cold tolerance, whereas longer photoperiods enhance desiccation resistance. Overall, thermal effects are pervasive throughout all measured resistance traits, whereas photoperiodic effects are of limited importance in the directly developing (i.e. nondiapausing) flies used here, suggesting that pronounced photoperiodic effects on stress resistance traits may be largely limited to, and triggered by, diapause-inducing effects.

Caveats have also been surfaced about the future development of RE and energy efficiency technologies since a mosaic of setbacks are hindering large scale clean energy development. In academia, perceptions of clean energy and energy efficiency technologies have been largely investigated from public acceptance point of view and to a narrower extent from the industrial and business landlords' point of view. However, studies that address these challenges to early-stage researchers and professors are limited, though they appear to play a pivotal role in advancing the science of RE. In this context, we conducted a survey-based study among a group of early-stage researchers (PhDs) and professors, who participated in two training courses in the UK and Cyprus. A total of 122 questionnaires were collected from the participants. The study found that progress in RE development was perceived to be developing moderately worldwide and hibernating in some countries. The respondents, regardless of their level of professional expertise and country's income class, perceived the prime factors hindering RE development worldwide were the lack of governmental policies, competition from fossil fuels (conventional and non-conventional), and lack of public awareness and support. Based on the respondents' geographical location, European academics perceived the lack of public support, Asian academics perceived the lack of supportive governmental policies, and African academics perceived the lack of mobilized public finance as key barriers to RE development. The participants emphasized the need to increase financial support for clean energy R&D, gradually adopt the uptake of renewables, and encourage synchronous and gradual elimination of fossil fuel subsidies.

The underlying molecular genetic mechanism is not fully clear, however, four maturity loci E1, E2, E3 and E4 have been molecularly identified. In this report, cultivars were selected with various photoperiod sensitivities from different ecological zones, which covered almost all maturity groups (MG) from MG 000 to MG VIII and MG X adapted from latitude N 18 degrees to N 53 degrees. They were planted in the field under natural daylength condition (ND) in Beijing, China or in pots under different photoperiod treatments. Maturity-related traits were then investigated. The four E maturity loci were genotyped at the molecular level. Our results suggested that these four E genes have different impacts on maturity and their allelic variations and combinations determine the diversification of soybean maturity and adaptation to different latitudes. The genetic mechanisms underlying photoperiod sensitivity and adaptation in wild soybean seemed unique from those in cultivated soybean. The allelic combinations and functional molecular markers for the four E loci will significantly assist molecular breeding towards high productivity.

One way to increase biomass yields is to move southern adapted lowland cultivars to more northern latitudes. However, many southerly adapted switchgrass germplasm can suffer significant winter kill in northerly climes. Materials and Methods: Here, we have applied next-generation sequencing in combination with biochemical analyses to query the metabolism of crowns and rhizomes obtained from two contrasting switchgrass cultivars. Crowns and rhizomes from field-grown lowland (cv Kanlow) and upland (cv Summer) switchgrass cultivars were collected from three randomly selected post-flowering plants. Summer plants were senescing, whereas Kanlow plants were not at this harvest date. Results: Principal component analysis (PCA) differentiated between both the Summer and Kanlow transcriptomes and metabolomes. Significant differences in transcript abundances were detected for 8,050 genes, including transcription factors such as WRKYs and those associated with phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. Gene-set enrichment analyses showed that a number of pathways were differentially up-regulated in the two populations. For both populations, protein levels and enzyme activities agreed well with transcript abundances for genes involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway that were up-regulated in Kanlow crowns and rhizomes. The combination of these datasets suggests that dormancy-related mechanisms had been triggered in the crowns and rhizomes of the Summer plants, whereas the crowns and rhizomes of Kanlow plants had yet to enter dormancy. Conclusions: Delayed establishment of dormancy at more northerly latitudes could be one factor that reduces winter-survival in the high-yielding Kanlow plants. Understanding the cellular signatures that accompany the transition to dormancy can be used in the future to select plants with improved winter hardiness.

J	Innes, DJ; Ginn, M				Innes, David J.; Ginn, Michael			A population of sexual Daphnia pulex resists invasion by asexual clones	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Asexual reproduction avoids the costs associated with sex, predicting that invading asexual clones can quickly replace sexual populations. Daphnia pulex populations in the Great Lakes area are predominately asexual, but the elimination of sexual populations by invading clones is poorly understood. Asexual clones were detected at low frequency in one rare sexual population in 1995, with some increase in frequency during 2003 and 2004. However, these clones remained at low frequency during further yearly sampling (2005-2013) with no evidence that the resident sexual population was in danger of elimination. There was evidence for hybridization between rare males produced by asexual clones and sexual females with the potential to produce new asexual genotypes and spread the genetic factors for asexuality. In a short-term laboratory competition experiment, the two most common asexual clones did not increase in frequency relative to a genetically diverse sexual population due in part to a greater investment in diapausing eggs that trades-off current population growth for increased contribution to the egg bank. Our results suggest that a successful invasion can be prolonged, requiring a combination of clonal genotypes with high fitness, persistence of clones in the egg bank and negative factors affecting the sexual population such as inbreeding depression resulting from population bottlenecks.

At northern latitudes, black and brown bears can be in a state of hibernation for up to seven months. As a result of this prolonged occupation of one small space, bears can be vulnerable to environmental and human caused disturbances. In this study, we developed a predictive model that identifies potential den habitat for black bears that can assist with management planning for industrial land development activities. We identified 40 dens (17 excavated in soil and 23 natural rock cavities) and used fine-scale information to determine how dens were positioned in forest stands. We found that bears denned in areas on mid to upper slope positions and that soil dens were located mainly in clay-loam soil complexes while rock cavity dens were either caves or cavities in boulder piles. Den location was distant from portions of the study area with relatively high road density. We then used resource selection functions to predict where bear dens might be located on the landscape. When applied to the GIS data, the averaged coefficients suggested that 3.1% of the study area had a high suitability ranking as den habitat while 9.1%, 14.6%, and 73.2% had mid, low, and limited suitability, respectively. In our study area, habitat for den sites is reasonably predictable and should be considered during the planning of industrial activities.																	0909-6396	1903-220X				AUG	2014	20	4					238	245		10.2981/wlb.00037								WOS:000341702800006

Factors associated with winged forms of soybean aphid and an examination of North American spatial dynamics of this species in the context of migratory behaviour	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST ENTOMOLOGY												1 Soybean aphid is a severe invasive pest of soybeans in North America. From 2005 onward, a network of 47 suction traps in North America, each approximately 7 m in height, has monitored aerial populations of this species. 2 Suction trap captures of alate viviparous Aphis glycines in summer, and gynoparae and males in the autumn, were subjected to negative binomial regressions with environmental parameters. Models were ranked by using information-theoretic methods to determine which parameters best explained aerial density of aphids. Multiparameter models incorporating the best parameters were constructed. 3 Best-fit models were used to compute peak values of each parameter, where a quadratic relationship between captures and that parameter occurred. Data were subjected to non-metric multidimensional scaling and analysis of similarity to observe patterns in the geographical and temporal distribution of captures. 4 Summer flight activity A. glycines was explained best by the level of aphid infestation in fields local to the trapping site, although the autumn female flight activity peak and male activity was best explained by photoperiod. 5 Seven-metre tall suction traps are useful for determining when flight activity of A. glycines occurs within a region.

It has recently been suggested that expected increases in temperature might lead to an additional generation per season in bark beetles. Thus, populations would grow more rapidly. However, an additional but not fully developed generation could lead to high winter mortality in the pre-imaginal stages. 2. Winter survivability and post-diapause fitness as a function of the overwintering developmental stage of the spruce bark beetle Ips typographus L. were studied along an allitudinal cline, Fitness was tested in terms of weight, lipid content and flight capacity. 3. Mortality was significantly lower and emergence per brood system significantly higher for fully developed adults that entered overwintering than for larvae, pupae or callow adults. 4. Post-diapause fitness in terms of dry weight and flight capacity was significantly higher in individuals that completed development before winter, and lipid contents also showed a trend for being higher in those individuals. 5. In conclusion, in a scenario where effective temperature sums are not adequate for the complete development of an additional generation, models may overestimate population growth by neglecting increased mortality and reduced post-diapause fitness, The results highlight the importance of considering life-history traits and indirect effects in addition to abiotic factors such as temperature when modelling population dynamics.																	0307-6946	1365-2311				AUG	2014	39	4					519	526		10.1111/een.12127								WOS:000340662000014						
J	Heinze, J; Rueppell, O				Heinze, Juergen; Rueppell, Olav			The frequency of multi-queen colonies increases with altitude in a Nearctic ant	ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												1. Most ants in boreal and alpine habitats are facultatively polygynous, their colonies may contain one or several queens. It was investigated how the proportion of polygynous colonies varies along an elevation gradient from 60 to 2700 m in the Nearctic ant Temnothorax rugatutulus (Emery). 2. Across all populations, the proportion of polygynous colonies was positively correlated with altitude. The correlation was considerably stronger when only populations in the narrow area of the Chiricahua Mts, Arizona, were compared. 3. The dominance of polygynous colonies at high altitudes may be associated with selection against solitary colony founding by young queens. In areas with short summers and long winters, hibernation mortality of solitarily founding queens may select for alternative reproductive tactics, such as polygyny and colony founding by budding. 4. Colony founding tactics need to be taken into account to more fully understand altitudinal and latitudinal patterns of ant faunas.

Here we show that two interdependent regulatory regions are necessary and sufficient to convey photoperiod responsiveness to FT. While a minimal distance between the regulatory regions is required to fully suppress FT expression under short days, increased distance reduces promoter response to long days. Natural variation at FT creating promoter length differences is widespread, correlates with longitudinal and latitudinal clines and affects a promoter region physically interacting with both photoperiod control regions. Three major FT promoter variants correlate with differences in FT allele usage in F1 hybrids. We propose that FT variation in cis could be adaptive by conferring differences in FT transcriptional control ultimately translating to increased fitness.

The Large Copper butterfly, Lycaena dispar Haworth (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae), is a Palearctic butterfly that hibernates as larvae. Since this butterfly is a near threatened species in some regions, there has been a growing need for a standardized protocol for mass rearing of this butterfly based on the adequate knowledge of its ecology. In the present study, we first identified that L. dispar larvae were sensitive to the photoperiodic induction of diapause during their first larval instar. We then investigated to what extent the diapause-inducing effects of photoperiod could be modified by ambient temperatures in L. dispar larvae by exposing them to the range of day-lengths (L:D 14:10, 12:12, 10:14 and 8:16) at three different temperatures (15, 20 and 25 A degrees C). All larvae were induced to enter diapause at low ambient temperature (15 A degrees C) regardless of photoperiod, whereas most of them (86 %) exhibited direct development when temperature was high (25 A degrees C). The photoperiodic induction of diapause was evident when day-length was shorter than 14 h at intermediate temperature (20 A degrees C). Pre-diapause development was prolonged at low temperatures. Finally, we found that post-diapause development of L. dispar larvae was determined by both the chilling temperature experienced by diapausing larvae and the duration of larval diapause. Adult emergence was enhanced when larvae were chilled at 8 A degrees C and when they had been under the state of diapause for 20 days before they were treated to terminate diapause.																	1366-638X	1572-9753				AUG	2014	18	4					693	700		10.1007/s10841-014-9678-9								WOS:000340450000018

We evaluated the relative influence of terrestrial ecosystem state factors, anthropogenic gradients, and aquatic habitat variables on patterns of N concentration in streams and rivers across Sweden. We analyzed data from 115 national monitoring stations distributed along a 1,300 km latitudinal gradient, draining catchments that differed by more than 10 A degrees C in mean annual temperature (MAT), and more than five orders of magnitude in area. Regional trends in total organic nitrogen (TON) and carbon:nitrogen (C:N) were closely linked to broad-scale gradients in state factors (e.g., MAT), reflecting the importance of long-term ecosystem development on terrestrial organic matter accrual and export. In contrast, trends in nitrate (NO3 (-)), the dominant form of inorganic N, were largely unrelated to state factors, but instead were closely connected to gradients related to anthropogenic inputs (e.g., agricultural cover). Despite large differences in drainage size and cover by lakes and wetlands among sites, these descriptors of the aquatic environment had little influence on spatial patterns of N chemistry. The temporal variability in N concentrations also differed between forms: inorganic N was strongly seasonal, with peaks during dormant periods that underscore biotic control over terrestrial losses of limiting resources. Organic N showed comparatively weaker seasonality, but summertime increases suggest temperature-driven patterns of soil TON production and export-temporal signals which were modified by variables that govern water residence time within catchments. Unique combinations of regional predictors reflect basic differences in the cycling of organic versus inorganic N and highlight variation in the sensitivity of these different N forms to environmental changes that directly alter inputs of resources, or indirectly modify terrestrial ecosystems through shifts in species composition, rates of forest productivity, soil development, and hydrologic routing.

Sex in an uncertain world: environmental stochasticity helps restore competitive balance between sexually and asexually reproducing populations	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY												Like many organisms, individuals of the freshwater ostracod species Eucypris virens exhibit either obligate sexual or asexual reproductive modes. Both types of individual routinely co-occur, including in the same temporary freshwater pond (their natural habitat in which they undergo seasonal diapause). Given the well-known two-fold cost of sex, this begs the question of how sexually reproducing individuals are able to coexist with their asexual counterparts in spite of such overwhelming costs. Environmental stochasticity in the form of 'false dawn' inundations (where the first hydration is ephemeral and causes loss of early hatching individuals) may provide an advantage to the sexual subpopulation, which shows greater variation in hatching times following inundation. We explore the potential role of environmental stochasticity in this system using life-history data analysis, climate data, and matrix projection models. In the absence of environmental stochasticity, the population growth rate is significantly lower in sexual subpopulations. Climate data reveal that 'false dawn' inundations are common. Using matrix projection modelling with and without environmental stochasticity, we demonstrate that this phenomenon can restore appreciable balance to the system, in terms of population growth rates. This provides support for the role of environmental stochasticity in helping to explain the maintenance of sex and the occurrence of geographical parthenogenesis.																	1010-061X	1420-9101				AUG	2014	27	8					1650	1661		10.1111/jeb.12419								WOS:000339713100015	24836646

Timing for success: expression phenotype and local adaptation related to latitude in the boreal forest tree, Populus balsamifera	TREE GENETICS & GENOMES												Timing of seasonal dormancy is among the most important traits allowing forest tree populations to span latitudinal gradients of temperature and growing season length. We used RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data to identify gene expression differences between latitude-adapted populations and search for elevated genetic differentiation, a signature of adaptation, between northern and southern populations of Populus balsamifera. RNA was extracted from leaf tissues collected from trees originating from two northern (65A degrees N) and two southern (50A degrees N) populations and growing in a common garden. Leaves for RNA-seq were collected on the same day in late July, when southern trees were actively growing and northern trees had set bud. Transcripts of 2,594 genes were more abundant in actively growing leaves, whereas 1,424 were more abundant in leaves of trees that had set bud. The actively growing southern trees exhibited overexpression of genes in the biological process gene ontology (GO) domain, whereas dormant northern trees exhibited overexpression of genes in the cellular component domain. We identified relatively few genes (641) bearing signatures consistent with local adaptation to latitude for three or more SNPs. Exons from differentially expressed (DE) genes were not more likely than non-DE genes to exhibit patterns of latitudinal differentiation consistent with local adaptation. These results indicate that genes associated with differences in the timing of bud set, which is correlated with initiation of dormancy, were not more likely than other categories to exhibit latitudinal differentiation in exonic regions.																	1614-2942	1614-2950				AUG	2014	10	4					911	922		10.1007/s11295-014-0731-3								WOS:000339906200012

Challenges in predicting climate change impacts on pome fruit phenology	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY												Climate projection data were applied to two commonly used pome fruit flowering models to investigate potential differences in predicted full bloom timing. The two methods, fixed thermal time and sequential chill-growth, produced different results for seven apple and pear varieties at two Australian locations. The fixed thermal time model predicted incremental advancement of full bloom, while results were mixed from the sequential chill-growth model. To further investigate how the sequential chill-growth model reacts under climate perturbed conditions, four simulations were created to represent a wider range of species physiological requirements. These were applied to five Australian locations covering varied climates. Lengthening of the chill period and contraction of the growth period was common to most results. The relative dominance of the chill or growth component tended to predict whether full bloom advanced, remained similar or was delayed with climate warming. The simplistic structure of the fixed thermal time model and the exclusion of winter chill conditions in this method indicate it is unlikely to be suitable for projection analyses. The sequential chill-growth model includes greater complexity; however, reservations in using this model for impact analyses remain. The results demonstrate that appropriate representation of physiological processes is essential to adequately predict changes to full bloom under climate perturbed conditions with greater model development needed.

Response to cold acclimation in diapause pupae of Hyles euphorbiae (Lepidoptera: Sphingidae): candidate biomarker identification using proteomics	INSECT MOLECULAR BIOLOGY												The distribution range of Hyles euphorbiae covers distinct climates across the Palaearctic. Previous investigations showed a correlation between mitochondrial DNA identity of populations and climatic conditions related to winter; however, the lack of biomarkers hampers investigations to test whether geographically distinct populations do show specific molecular responses to low temperatures or whether they possess specific genetic identity at loci functionally related to cold response. The present study was designed to identify candidate protein biomarkers and biological processes that are associated with cold acclimation of overwintering H. euphorbiae diapause pupae. Specimens taken from a single central European population were gradually cooled from 20 degrees C to -2 degrees C over 36 days and 12 differentially abundant proteins were identified. In addition, DeepSuperSAGE sequencing technology was applied to study differentially regulated genes. There was incongruence between differentially abundant proteins and differentially expressed genes, but functional characteristics of regulated proteins and analyses of gene ontology term enrichment among differentially regulated genes pointed to activation of the same biological processes, e. g. oxidative stress response. As proteins represent biologically active molecules, candidate biomarkers derived from proteomics are considered well suited to explore intraspecific patterns of local adaptation to different climates.

The Growth and Survival of Mycobacterium smegmatis Is Enhanced by Co-Metabolism of Atmospheric H-2	PLOS ONE												The soil bacterium Mycobacterium smegmatis is able to scavenge the trace concentrations of H-2 present in the atmosphere, but the physiological function and importance of this activity is not understood. We have shown that atmospheric H-2 oxidation in this organism depends on two phylogenetically and kinetically distinct high-affinity hydrogenases, Hyd1 (MSMEG_2262-2263) and Hyd2 (MSMEG_2720-2719). In this study, we explored the effect of deleting Hyd2 on cellular physiology by comparing the viability, energetics, transcriptomes, and metabolomes of wild-type vs. Delta hyd2 cells. The long-term survival of the Delta hyd2 mutant was significantly reduced compared to the wild-type. The mutant additionally grew less efficiently in a range of conditions, most notably during metabolism of short-chain fatty acids; there was a twofold reduction in growth rate and growth yield of the Delta hyd2 strain when acetate served as the sole carbon source. Hyd1 compensated for loss of Hyd2 when cells were grown in a high H-2 atmosphere. Analysis of cellular parameters showed that Hyd2 was not necessary to generate the membrane potential, maintain intracellular pH homeostasis, or sustain redox balance. However, microarray analysis indicated that Delta hyd2 cells were starved for reductant and compensated by rewiring central metabolism; transcripts encoding proteins responsible for oxidative decarboxylation pathways, the urea cycle, and ABC transporter-mediated import were significantly more abundant in the Delta hyd2 mutant. Metabolome profiling consistently revealed an increase in intracellular amino acids in the Delta hyd2 mutant. We propose that atmospheric H2 oxidation has two major roles in mycobacterial cells: to generate reductant during mixotrophic growth and to sustain the respiratory chain during dormancy.

Experimental evolution of bet hedging under manipulated environmental uncertainty in Neurospora crassa	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												All organisms are faced with environmental uncertainty. Bet-hedging theory expects unpredictable selection to result in the evolution of traits that maximize the geometric-mean fitness even though such traits appear to be detrimental over the shorter term. Despite the centrality of fitness measures to evolutionary analysis, no direct test of the geometric-mean fitness principle exists. Here, we directly distinguish between predictions of competing fitness maximization principles by testing Cohen's 1966 classic bet-hedging model using the fungus Neurospora crassa. The simple prediction is that propagule dormancy will evolve in proportion to the frequency of 'bad' years, whereas the prediction of the alternative arithmetic-mean principle is the evolution of zero dormancy as long as the expectation of a bad year is less than 0.5. Ascospore dormancy fraction in N. crassa was allowed to evolve under five experimental selection regimes that differed in the frequency of unpredictable 'bad years'. Results were consistent with bet-hedging theory: final dormancy fraction in 12 genetic lineages across 88 independently evolving samples was proportional to the frequency of bad years, and evolved both upwards and downwards as predicted from a range of starting dormancy fractions. These findings suggest that selection results in adaptation to variable rather than to expected environments.

Here, the combined effects of ocean acidification and photoperiod on the physiological response of the Antarctic sea ice microalgae Chlamydomonas sp. ICE-L were examined. There was a general increase in growth, PSII photosynthetic parameters, and N and P uptake in continuous light, compared to those exposed to regular dark and light cydes. Elevated pCO(2) showed no consistent effect on growth rate (p = 0.8) and N uptake (p = 0.38) during exponential phrase, depending on the photoperiod but had a positive effect on PSII photosynthetic capacity and P uptake. Continuous dark reduced growth, photosynthesis, and nutrient uptake. Moreover, intracellular lipid, mainly in the form of PUFA, was consumed at 80% and 63% in low and high pCO(2) in darkness. However, long-term culture under high pCO(2) gave a more significant inhibition of growth and F-v/F-m to high light stress. In summary, ocean acidification may have significant effects on Chlamydomonas sp. ICE-L survival in polar winter. The current study contributes to an understanding of how a sea ice algae-based community may respond to global climate change at high latitudes.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				JUL 15	2014	48	14					7738	7746		10.1021/es404866z								WOS:000339227500010	24922067

To this end, the effects of three temperature regimes, namely 20, 25 and 30 degrees C, on the virulence of four Beauveria and two Metarhizium isolates against the cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii, were investigated under controlled conditions, 65-70% relative humidity, and a photoperiod of 12:12 (light: dark) hours. The isolates did vary significantly in their activities of efficacy over a range of temperatures. The highest mortality and lowest survival times were observed at 25 degrees C for DLCO41 and at 30 degrees C for DLCO87; while mortality decreased and survival time increased at temperatures of 20 degrees C. Besides the tested fungal isolate DLCO87 had the lowest LC50 value (6.84 x 10(5) conidia mL(-1)) at 30 degrees C. The promising result of this study should enable us to conduct further studies to determine the potential use of the fungus as an agent against Aphis gossypii both in greenhouse and under field conditions.																	0967-0874	1366-5863				JUL 3	2014	60	3					173	179		10.1080/09670874.2014.951101								WOS:000345204700005

Eggs were obtained from adult females collected from three locations in Japan and incubated under short- or long-day photoperiods at a constant temperature of 25, 20, or 15 degrees C. Egg diapause was eventually terminated in all treatments. Because differences in the average developmental time were small among the temperature treatments, it was concluded that the rate of diapause development is more rapid at lower temperatures, as in other Odonata species. A clear geographic trend was not found in the egg period, which may reflect the life cycle of S. frequens: the timing of reproduction is the same or even earlier in higher than in lower latitudes. Relatively large variations in embryonic period were found among populations and even within a population at 15 degrees C, suggesting that the rate of diapause development is also variable. The results also suggested that a short photoperiod might prevent S. frequens eggs from hatching before the onset of winter.																	1388-7890	2159-6719				JUL 3	2014	17	2-3					81	87		10.1080/13887890.2014.907546								WOS:000343829400004

MOVING MASSASAUGAS: INSIGHT INTO RATTLESNAKE RELOCATION USING SISTRURUS C. CATENATUS	HERPETOLOGICAL CONSERVATION AND BIOLOGY												Relocating snakes is used to reduce potential snake-human conflict and to re-establish or augment populations. Relocation may be unsuccessful if snakes attempt to home back to their capture locations or otherwise alter their behavior in ways that reduce fitness. To better understand the conditions under which the technique is likely to be successful, we conducted two types of relocation (repatriation and short-distance translocation) using Eastern Massasaugas (Sistrurus c. catenatus) in Ontario. For the repatriation experiment, 27 snakes were captive-born, raised for four years, and released into a nature reserve previously known to host massasaugas. Other than being relatively sedentary, snakes behaved normally upon release in that they engaged in reproductive behavior. Survival (70%) was relatively high until hibernation (19 weeks). However, none of the snakes that did hibernate (n = 19) survived into the following active season. In a preliminary assessment of the effects of short-distance translocation, snakes that we moved 200 m from capture locations (n = 4) did not return, nor did they exhibit abnormal movement or basking behavior relative to non-translocated controls (n = 7). The different outcomes of our two relocations could indicate that the success of relocation depends on the extent of displacement and the source of relocated individuals, although corroborating evidence is needed before these results can be used to support management strategies.																	2151-0733	1931-7603				JUL	2014	9	1					67	75										WOS:000343398000007

Among these, photoperiod is considered the main regulator of primates' seasonal reproduction, thus the latitudinal distribution of primate populations is a key factor determining the appearance of seasonal reproduction. The present work presents supporting discrete seasonality in male stumptailed macaques (Macaca arctoides). We investigated whether semen quality and testosterone covaried with Mexico City's photoperiod and relative humidity by analyzing variations in the portions that form the ejaculate: the seminal liquid, the seminal coagulum, and the copulatory plug. Five male adult stump-tailed macaques were electroejaculated once a month, obtaining three semen samples per male, from August 2011 to July 2012 (except for December 2011) (n = 165). Our results showed that stump-tailed macaque sperm counts were significantly different between the portions of the ejaculate. The seminal coagulum contained the significantly largest number of spermatozoids, followed by the copulatory plug and the seminal fluid. Photoperiod and relative humidity had major influence on the sperm count in the seminal coagulum and the testosterone concentrations. Testosterone reached its highest values around the time when days and nights lasted the same hours, decreasing when days either grew longer or became shorter. Concerning relative humidity, sperm counts in the seminal coagulum were highly variable on dry days, but decreased as the relative humidity increased. We conclude that stump-tailed macaques have a discrete seasonality, occurring in spring and fall when macaques' reproductive condition and readiness for postcopulatory intrasexual competition increase.																	0032-8332	1610-7365				JUL	2014	55	3					393	401		10.1007/s10329-014-0414-6								WOS:000343141900008	24585247

Assessing leaf spectral properties of Phragmites australis impacted by acid mine drainage	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE												The decanting of acid mine drainage (AMD) from the Western Basin on the Witwatersrand in late 2010 raised concerns about AMD risks in other gold, coal and copper mining areas of South Africa. Field spectroscopy and the use of vegetation indices could offer an affordable and easy means of monitoring the impact of mine water and/or AMD on vegetation. The impact of raw and treated mine water or contaminated soil on wetland vegetation often manifests in growth inhibition and reduction of foliar pigments and nutrient levels. Surveying the impact on wetland vegetation or underlying soils can be difficult and expensive considering the cost of laboratory analysis of samples. The potential of field spectroscopy for detecting the impact of mine water on wetland vegetation was examined by assessing (1) whether there was a significant difference in leaf spectra between sites receiving mine water and a non-impacted control site and (2) whether there was a gradation of vegetation condition downstream from the decanting site. Two vegetation indices were derived from portable field spectrometer-measured spectra of five green leaves of Phragmites australis - the chlorophyll red edge position (REP) and the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) - for two dormant (winter) and peak growth (summer) seasons in 2011-2012. Mean REP and NDVI values were significantly (p<0.05) lower for affected sites compared to the control site for both seasons and years. The range of REP values for young green leaves in winter for affected sites was 695-720 nm compared to the narrower range of 705-721 nm for the control site. The mean REP values for young green leaves in winter was 708 nm for the affected sites compared to 716 nm for the control site. The downstream gradation, however, fluctuated for REP and NDVI over the study period. We conclude that field spectroscopy shows potential to serve as a relatively quick and affordable means to assess the condition and health of vegetation affected by AMD.

GENETICS												Parallel clines in different species, or in different geographical regions of the same species, are an important source of information on the genetic basis of local adaptation. We recently detected latitudinal clines in SNPs frequencies and gene expression of candidate genes for growth cessation in Scandinavian populations of Norway spruce (Picea abies). Here we test whether the same clines are also present in Siberian spruce (P. obovata), a close relative of Norway spruce with a different Quaternary history. We sequenced nine candidate genes and 27 control loci and genotyped 14 SSR loci in six populations of P. obovata located along the Yenisei river from latitude 56 N to latitude 67 N. In contrast to Scandinavian Norway spruce that both departs from the standard neutral model (SNM) and shows a clear population structure, Siberian spruce populations along the Yenisei do not depart from the SNM and are genetically unstructured. Nonetheless, as in Norway spruce, growth cessation is significantly clinal. Polymorphisms in photoperiodic (FTL2) and circadian clock (Gigantea, GI, PRR3) genes also show significant clinal variation and/or evidence of local selection. In GI, one of the variants is the same as in Norway spruce. Finally, a strong cline in gene expression is observed for FTL2, but not for GI. These results, together with recent physiological studies, confirm the key role played by FTL2 and circadian clock genes in the control of growth cessation in spruce species and suggest the presence of parallel adaptation in these two species.

J	Austin, SH; Hau, M; Robinson, WD				Austin, Suzanne H.; Hau, Michaela; Robinson, W. Douglas			Effect of photoperiod on incubation period in a wild passerine, Sylvia atricapilla	JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY												Time required for avian embryos to develop is influenced by incubation temperature and the amount of time adults incubate eggs. Experiments on poultry indicate that photoacceleration, the light-induced stimulation of embryonic development, decreases the length of the incubation period as embryos receive more light. We hypothesized that eggs of wild birds exposed to longer periods of light should also have shorter incubation periods. We tested whether photoacceleration would occur in a species of open-cup nesting passerine, the blackcap Sylvia atricapilla. We artificially incubated blackcap eggs under four different photoperiods, four hours of light (4L) and 20 h of dark (20D), 12L:12D, 20L:4D, and a skeleton photoperiod (1 h light, 2 times per day) that framed a 20 h day. While incubation periods were accelerated with increasing photoperiod length, the differences among photoperiods of 4, 12 and 20L were weak. Embryos exposed to skeleton photoperiods developed as fast as those exposed to 20L and significantly faster than those exposed to 4L and 12L treatments. Skeleton photoperiods may most closely approximate natural patterns of light exposure that embryos experience during dawn and dusk incubation recesses typically associated with adult foraging. If our results from this species also occur in other wild birds, exposure to different day lengths may help explain some of the variation in the observed seasonal and latitudinal trends in avian incubation period.																	0908-8857	1600-048X				JUL	2014	45	4					359	364		10.1111/jav.00046								WOS:000339485600007

DC	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												The genus Canavalia includes 60 species, of which 37 are found in the Neotropics. One of the most common members of this genus is Canavalia rosea. In this paper, we present a compilation of the ecological, physiological, and geomorphological biology of this pantropical beach and coastal dune species that will serve as a basis for scientists and managers interested in the species. This legume (Fabaceae) is a perennial trailing vine that grows on five continents and is also found on many islands. The leaves are compound, and the leaflets are roughly circular in shape, with an entire margin and a short petiole. The flowers are small, pink-purple, in racemes and range from 1 to 3 cm in diameter. Blooming takes place with greatest intensity between May and September, although sporadic racemes can be found throughout the year. Fruits are large, 7-12 cm long, with marbled brown dormant seeds. The root is monopodic and presents a mycorrhizal association. It is a successful colonizer of tropical shorelines due to the dispersal of its seeds by ocean currents and a high tolerance to salt spray, burial, low-nutrient substrates, and high temperature. The species is an important sand colonizer and plays a significant role in the geomorphology of beaches and frontal dunes. The species often covers large areas and forms a relatively continuous mat that stabilizes the sandy substrate in which it grows. The leaves, stems, and seeds have many nutritional and medicinal uses due to their high protein content and active bactericidal ingredients.

J	Karlsson, B				Karlsson, Bengt			Extended season for northern butterflies	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY												Butterflies are like all insects in that they are temperature sensitive and a changing climate with higher temperatures might effect their phenology. Several studies have found support for earlier flight dates among the investigated species. A comparative study with data from a citizen science project, including 66 species of butterflies in Sweden, was undertaken, and the result confirms that most butterfly species now fly earlier during the season. This is especially evident for butterflies overwintering as adults or as pupae. However, the advancement in phenology is correlated with flight date, and some late season species show no advancement or have even postponed their flight dates and are now flying later in the season. The results also showed that latitude had a strong effect on the adult flight date, and most of the investigated species showed significantly later flights towards the north. Only some late flying species showed an opposite trend, flying earlier in the north. A majority of the investigated species in this study showed a general response to temperature and advanced their flight dates with warmer temperatures (on average they advanced their flight dates by 3.8 days/A degrees C), although not all species showed this response. In essence, a climate with earlier springs and longer growing seasons seems not to change the appearance patterns in a one-way direction. We now see butterflies on the wings both earlier and later in the season and some consequences of these patterns are discussed. So far, studies have concentrated mostly on early season butterfly-plant interactions but also late season studies are needed for a better understanding of long-term population consequences.																	0020-7128	1432-1254				JUL	2014	58	5					691	701		10.1007/s00484-013-0649-8								WOS:000339105300008	23456374

Chilling curves to determine the start date of the heat accumulation period were constructed and evaluated. The results allow us to conclude that the northern olive populations have the greatest heat requirements for the development of their floral buds, and they need a period of time longer than olives in others areas to completely satisfy their biothermic requirements. The olive trees located in the warmest winter areas have a faster transition from endogenous to exogenous inhibition once the peak of chilling is met, and they show more rapid floral development. The lower heat requirements are due to better adaptation to warmer regions. Both the threshold temperature and the peak of flowering date are closely related to latitude. Different types of biological responses of olives to the environment were found. The adaptive capacity shown by the olive tree should be considered as a useful tool with which to study the effects of global climatic change on agro-ecosystems.

However, such studies are extremely rare at the continental scale because of limited observations and potential collinearity and spatial autocorrelation among abiotic factors that can make the attribution difficult. This study was designed to explore and quantify environmental variables that could closely relate to soybean phenotypic traits across China. The data of cultivated soybean phenotypic traits (i.e., 100-seed weight, crude oil content, protein content, plant height) and environmental variables were compiled from 18,686 samples across 29 provinces of China. Different regression models were used to remove collinearity and spatial autocorrelation among selected variables. As the first attempt at a continental scale, our study shows that climatic and geographic variables contributed much more to trait variations than soils did, of which the minimum temperature was most critical, followed by longitude, and soil properties explained more variances on crude protein content than on others. Abiotic variables explained 29, 20, 17 and 38% of the observed variations (P<0.05) of crude protein content, crude oil content, 100-seed weight and plant height, respectively. This result implies that, besides the effects of farming practices such as fertilization, irrigation, planting density, etc., biotic factors (e.g., genes) likely play a more important role in determining the phenotypic traits and their spatial variability. It is possible to improve soybean quality and yield by selecting suitable environments even though it is hard to develop a kind of soybean varieties with all ideal germplasm traits simultaneously.

Changes in occurrence, richness, and biological traits of dragonflies and damselflies (Odonata) in California and Nevada over the past century	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Increases in water demand, urbanization, and severity of drought threaten freshwater ecosystems of the arid western United States. Historical assessments of change in assemblages over time can help determine the effects of these stressors but, to date, are rare. In the present study, we resurveyed 45 sites originally sampled in 1914-1915 for Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) adults throughout central California and northwestern Nevada, USA. We examined changes in species occurrence rates, taxonomic richness, and biological trait composition in relation to climate changes and human population increases. While species richness at individual sites did not change significantly, we found that odonate assemblages have become more similar across sites. Homogenization is a result of the expansion of highly mobile habitat generalists, and the decline of both habitat specialists and species with an overwintering diapause stage. Using a multi-species mixed-effects model, we found that overall occurrences of Odonata increased with higher minimum temperatures. Habitat specialists and species with a diapause stage, however, occurred less often in warmer regions and more often in areas with higher precipitation. Habitat specialists occurred less often in highly populated sites. Life history traits of Odonata, such as dispersal ability, habitat specialization, and diapause, are useful predictors of species-specific responses to urbanization and climate change in this region.																	0960-3115	1572-9710				JUL	2014	23	8					2107	2126		10.1007/s10531-014-0707-5								WOS:000338237500015

Spatial organization and activity patterns of the masked palm civet (Paguma larvata) in central-south China	JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY												Movement and activity patterns are important components of life history, being central to resource acquisition and defense, mating behavior, and individual survival and fitness. Here, we present results from the 1st systematic radiotracking study of the masked palm civet (Paguma larvata), a widespread viverrid found in subtropical and tropical forests of Asia. From June 2004 to November 2007, we radiotracked 12 masked palm civets (5 males and 7 females) in central-south China. Mean individual home-range size based on 95% minimum convex polygons was 192.6 ha +/- 42.6 SE (range = 64-451 ha). Although males had larger mean home-range sizes than females (276.8 and 136.5 ha, respectively), these differences were not statistically significant. Males also exhibited greater daily movement distances and extents than females, but we found no evidence of sexual dimorphism in body size. Masked palm civets were predominantly nocturnal, but were active intermittently during the day. No significant seasonal (monthly) differences in daily activity patterns were apparent. We did, however, observe reduced hours of activity-but not continuous inactivity-during winter; consequently, we concluded that our study animals did not hibernate or semihibernate. We speculate that our observations of home-range overlap among individuals may indicate group living in the masked palm civet.

Den selection by grizzly bears on a managed landscape	JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY												Hibernation is an adaptive strategy to avoid harsh environmental conditions and seasonal limitations in food and water. Unlike most hibernators, grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) are aroused easily while in dens and disturbances while denning can result in fitness costs if bears become active during this period. Our objectives were to determine den selection of male and female grizzly bears at multiple spatial scales in the boreal forest and Rocky Mountains of Alberta, Canada. Grizzly bears in Alberta are designated as threatened. However, little is known about den selection by grizzly bears in the boreal forest and the current land and forest management plans do not include any mitigation measures to minimize possible impacts on the denning habitat of grizzly bears. We compared dens to random available locations within fall home ranges using geographic information system-derived anthropogenic, land cover, landscape, and food resource variables. Male and female grizzly bears had similar habitat requirements when selecting dens, and females did not avoid sites associated with a greater probability of encountering males. At the broadest scale investigated, grizzly bears avoided wetlands, and selected high-elevation, dry conifer stands with abundant high-quality spring food. At more localized scales, grizzly bears selected areas of low road densities and dense conifers associated with little high-quality autumn food. Slope angle had the most influence on den selection followed by percent autumn food, road densities, percent wetland, and percent spring food. We recommend limiting human disturbance, including open roads, within core grizzly bear conservation areas for areas with high suitable den habitat.				pigeon, karine/C-6336-2014; Nielsen, Scott/C-2842-2013	pigeon, karine/0000-0002-7409-5511; Nielsen, Scott/0000-0002-9754-0630												0022-2372	1545-1542				JUN 26	2014	95	3					559	571		10.1644/13-MAMM-A-137								WOS:000338272000011

CAVE-DWELLING ARTHROPODS AND VERTEBRATES OF NORTH RIM GRAND CANYON, WITH NOTES ON ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT	WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST												Prior to this study, there was no information on arthropods, bats, and other vertebrates of caves in north-westernmost Arizona. Based on invertebrate and vertebrate inventory work conducted during 2005 and 2006, we provide future directions for conservation and management for caves on Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument, northwestern Arizona. Baseline investigations to find and identify arthropods, bats, and other vertebrates were conducted at 7 of the largest known caves on the monument. We identified 52 morphospecies including 44 arthropods, 4 bats, and 4 other vertebrates. Of the cave-dwelling arthropods, we found 10 eisodophiles, 6 troglophiles, 8 questionable troglophiles, 7 trogloxenes, 8 accidentals, 3 taxa of unknown cave affiliations, and 2 mammalian parasites. We made several contributions to the entomological record including 2 new genera, 6 new species, 3 possible new species, one range extension, and one possible range extension. Also, we identified 5 bat roosts-1 hibernaculum, 2 night roosts, and 3 summer roosts of unconfirmed use. Observed arthropod richness per cave ranged from 1 to 14 morphospecies, and observed bat and other vertebrate (combined) richness was 1-3 morphospecies. We did not detect any cave-adapted arthropods during this investigation. For the caves sampled, we are uncertain whether the lack of cave-adapted taxa is due to (a) low nutrient input and high cryptoaridity associated with many southwestern cave systems or (b) lack of intensive sampling. Despite the lack of cave-adapted species, 5 of the 7 caves inventoried are considered of high management concern. Additional research at these caves will be required to obtain the data necessary to best manage and protect these systems.

Although overwintering larvae have the physiological potential to survive by freezing or cryoprotective dehydration, use of the latter strategy may be constrained by inoculative freezing within hibernacula. To investigate the influence of microhabitat type on larval overwintering, we selected four substrate types that differed markedly in their composition and hydric characteristics. Organic content of these substrates ranged from 14 to 89 %. High organic content was associated with higher values for saturation moisture content (up to 2.0 H2O g(-1) dry mass) as well as elevated levels of field moisture content. Seasonal values of field moisture content remained near or above the saturation moisture value for each microhabitat type, and when larvae were cooled in substrates rehydrated to field-based levels, they were unable to avoid inoculation by environmental ice, regardless of substrate type. Consequently, our data suggest that wet hibernacula would force most larvae to overwinter in a frozen state. Yet, dehydrated larvae were collected in April during the seasonal transition to winter suggesting that spatial and temporal variations in precipitation and microhabitat conditions may expose larvae to dehydration and promote larval overwintering in a cryoprotectively dehydrated state.

Spatial and temporal variability in recruitment of the cyanobacterium Gloeotrichia echinulata in an oligotrophic lake	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Recruitment from dormant stages in the benthos can provide a critically important inoculum for surface populations of phytoplankton, including bloom-forming cyanobacteria. For example, water-column populations of the large (1-3-mm diameter) colonial cyanobacterium Gloeotrichia echinulata (Smith) P. Richter can be strongly subsidized by benthic recruitment. Therefore, understanding controls on recruitment is essential to an investigation of the factors controlling Gloeotrichia blooms, which are increasing in low-nutrient lakes across northeastern North America. We quantified surface abundances and recruitment from littoral sediments at multiple near-shore sampling sites in oligotrophic Lake Sunapee, New Hampshire, USA, during the summers of 2005-2012 and used this data set-the longest known record of cyanobacterial recruitment-to investigate potential drivers of interannual differences in Gloeotrichia recruitment. We found extensive spatiotemporal variability in recruitment. Recruitment was higher at some sites than others, and within seasons, recruitment into replicate traps at the same site was generally more similar than recruitment at different sites. These data suggest that local factors, such as substrate quality or the size of the seed bank, may be important controls on recruitment. Benthic recruitment probably accounted for <4%, but possibly up to 8%, of pelagic populations, within the range observed in previous studies. Across years, higher seasonal recruitment rates were associated with greater lake mixing during August, including deeper thermoclines, lower Schmidt stability, lower minimum air temperatures, and greater variability in water temperature. Taken together, our data suggest that interannual variation in Gloeotrichia recruitment may be related to regional climatic variability.

Playing smart vs. playing safe: the joint expression of phenotypic plasticity and potential bet hedging across and within thermal environments	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY												Adaptive phenotypic plasticity evolves when cues reliably predict fitness consequences of life-history decisions, whereas bet hedging evolves when environments are unpredictable. These modes of response should be jointly expressed, because environmental variance is composed of both predictable and unpredictable components. However, little attention has been paid to the joint expression of plasticity and bet hedging. Here, I examine the simultaneous expression of plasticity in germination rate and two potential bet-hedging traits - germination fraction and within-season diversification in timing of germination - in seeds from multiple seed families of five geographically distant populations of Lobelia inflata (L.) subjected to a thermal gradient. Populations differ in germination plasticity to temperature, in total germination fraction and in the expression of potential diversification in the timing of germination. The observation of a negative partial correlation between the expression of plasticity and germination variance (potential diversification), and a positive correlation between plasticity and germination fraction is suggestive of a trade-off between modes of response to environmental variance. If the observed correlations are indicative of those between adaptive plasticity and bet hedging, we expect an optimal balance to exist and differ among populations. I discuss the challenges involved in testing whether the balance between plasticity and bet hedging depends on the relative predictability of environmental variance.

Gene expression in closely related species mirrors local adaptation: consequences for responses to a warming world	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Local adaptation of populations could preclude or slow range expansions in response to changing climate, particularly when dispersal is limited. To investigate the differential responses of populations to changing climatic conditions, we exposed poleward peripheral and central populations of two Lepidoptera to reciprocal, common-garden climatic conditions and compared their whole-transcriptome expression. We found evidence of simple population differentiation in both species, and in the species with previously identified population structure and phenotypic local adaptation, we found several hundred genes that responded in a synchronized and localized fashion. These genes were primarily involved in energy metabolism and oxidative stress, and expression levels were most divergent between populations in the same environment in which we previously detected divergence for metabolism. We found no localized genes in the species with less population structure and for which no local adaptation was previously detected. These results challenge the assumption that species are functionally similar across their ranges and poleward peripheral populations are preadapted to warmer conditions. Rather, some taxa deserve population-level consideration when predicting the effects of climate change because they respond in genetically based, distinctive ways to changing conditions.

J	Maguire, SE; Schmidt, PS; Sehgal, A				Maguire, Sarah E.; Schmidt, Paul S.; Sehgal, Amita			Natural Populations of Drosophila melanogaster Reveal Features of an Uncharacterized Circadian Property: The Lower Temperature Limit of Rhythmicity	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL RHYTHMS												Most cyclic biological processes are under control of a circadian molecular timing system that synchronizes these phenomena to the 24-h day. One generic property of circadian-controlled processes is that they operate within a specific temperature range, below which the manifestation of rhythm ceases. Little is known about the evolutionary relevance of the lower temperature limit of rhythmicity or about the mechanism underlying the loss of overt circadian behavior below this lower limit, especially in one model organism of chronobiology, Drosophila melanogaster. Natural populations of Drosophila are evolving under divergent selection pressures and so provide a source of diversity necessary to address these issues. Using lines derived from African populations, we find that there is natural variation in the expression of rhythmic behavior under low-temperature conditions. We found evidence that this variability is evolutionarily relevant at extremely low temperature (12 degrees C) because high-altitude populations exhibit selection for locally adapted genomes that contribute to rhythmic behavior. Lines resistant to 15 degrees C show an additional layer of diversity in their response to temperature extremes because some lines are resistant to low temperature (15 degrees C) only, whereas others are cross-resistant to high and low temperature (15 degrees C and 30 degrees C). Genetic analysis of one cold-resistant circadian line at 15 degrees C reveals that the phenotype maps to the X-chromosome but not to the core clock genes, per and sgg. Analysis of the central clock cells of this line reveals that maintenance of rhythm is associated with robust clock function, which is compromised in a standard laboratory strain. These data indicate that the cold-resistant circadian phenotype is clock based. This study highlights the importance of using natural populations to inform us of the basic features of circadian traits, especially those that might be under temperature-based selection.																	0748-7304	1552-4531				JUN	2014	29	3					167	180		10.1177/0748730414537801								WOS:000337566500002	24916390

Life at a different pace: Annual itineraries are conserved in seasonal songbirds	JOURNAL OF BIOSCIENCES												The duration of life history state (LHS) reflects the adaptive strategy a species has evolved to cope with a changing environment. Inhabitants at different latitudes may thus have significant differences in the rates of metabolic and physiological processes underlying LHSs. Birds, in order to maximize their fitness in the environment in which they live, seasonally switch from one LHS to another during the year. The present study investigated whether an annual itinerary of a species would determine its rate of reaction to inductive long days. We compared the photoinduced cycles of changes in body mass and testes, as indices of migratory and reproductive LHSs, between two long day breeding species, the migratory redheaded bunting and non-migratory Indian weaverbird. Changes in body mass and testis size were measured in photosensitive buntings and weaverbirds (n = 7 each) on short days (LD 8:16) subjected first to 0.5 h weekly light increments until the light period was 13 h per day, and then maintained on LD 13:11 for another 32 weeks. A, similar observation was recorded on a group of buntings (it = 14) and weaverbirds (n = 9) maintained on increasing natural day lengths (NDL; Lucknow, 26 degrees 55' N, 80 degrees 59' E) for 47 weeks. As predicted, the rates of induction of seasonal cycles under an identical inductive photoperiod were significantly faster in temperate buntings with five annual LHSs than in the subtropical weaverbirds with three annual LHSs. This suggests that annual itineraries of songbirds with which they may have evolved with at their breeding latitudes, determine their response to the external photoperiodic environment.																	0250-5991	0973-7138				JUN	2014	39	3					485	491		10.1007/s12038-014-9440-1								WOS:000337332900016	24845511

Assessing the Potential for Establishment of Western Cherry Fruit Fly Using Ecological Niche Modeling	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY												Sweet cherries, Prunus avium (L.) L., grown in the western United States are exported to many countries around the world. Some of these countries have enforced strict quarantine rules and trade restrictions owing to concerns about the potential establishment and subsequent spread of western cherry fruit fly, Rhagoletis indifferens Curran (Diptera: Tephritidae), a major quarantine pest of sweet cherry. We used 1) niche models (CLIMEX and MaxEnt) to map the climatic suitability, 2) North Carolina State University-Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service Plant Pest Forecasting System to examine chilling requirement, and 3) host distribution and availability to assess the potential for establishment of R. indifferens in areas of western North America where it currently does not exist and eight current or potential fresh sweet cherry markets: Colombia, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand, Venezuela, and Vietnam. Results from niche models conformed well to the current distribution of R. indifferens in western North America. MaxEnt and CLIMEX models had high performance and predicted climatic suitability in some of the countries (e.g., Andean range in Colombia and Venezuela, northern and northeastern India, central Taiwan, and parts of Vietnam). However, our results showed no potential for establishment of R. indifferens in Colombia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand, Venezuela, and Vietnam when the optimal chilling requirement to break diapause (minimum temperature <= 3 degrees C for at least 15 wk) was used as the criterion for whether establishment can occur. Furthermore, these countries have no host plant species available for R. indifferens. Our results can be used to make scientifically informed international trade decisions and negotiations by policy makers.

Traditionally correlated with dormancy, increases in transcript levels in response to various treatments have also been reported in various species. As alternative transcript splicing is common in stress conditions, the splice variants of AtDRM1 and AtDRM2 were assessed further in this study. A previously undescribed splice variant of AtDRM1 (AtDRM1.6) is introduced in this work. In silico analyses of predicted protein sequence of all splice variants showed that all variants retain the predicted intrinsically disordered nature. Transcriptional studies of AtDRM1 and AtDRM2 in response to a wide range of abiotic, physical and hormonal treatments showed that AtDRM1.6 is differentially regulated at the transcriptional level compared with other splice variants. Promoter analyses demonstrated AtDRM1 light regulation via the upstream promoter sequence.

J	Germain, RM; Gilbert, B				Germain, Rachel M.; Gilbert, Benjamin			Hidden responses to environmental variation: maternal effects reveal species niche dimensions	ECOLOGY LETTERS												Species responses to fluctuating environments structure population and community dynamics in variable ecosystems. Although offspring number is commonly used to measure these responses, maternal effects on offspring quality may be an important but largely unrecognised determinant of long-term population growth. We selected 29 species across a Mediterranean annual plant phylogeny, and grew populations of each species in wet and dry conditions to determine responses in seed number and maternal effects (seed size, seed dormancy, and seedling growth). Maternal effects were evident in over 40% of species, but only 24% responded through seed number. Despite a strong trade-off between seed size and seed number among species, there was no consistent trade-off within species; we observed correlations that ranged from positive to negative. Overall, species in this plant guild show a complex range of responses to environmental variation that may be underestimated when only seed number responses are considered.

J	Stuhldreher, G; Hermann, G; Fartmann, T				Stuhldreher, Gregor; Hermann, Gabriel; Fartmann, Thomas			Cold-adapted species in a warming world - an explorative study on the impact of high winter temperatures on a continental butterfly	ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA												Increasing evidence suggests that global warming significantly alters the range and phenology of plants and animals. Whereas thermophilous species usually benefit from rising temperatures, the living conditions of taxa adapted to cooler or continental climates are deteriorating. The woodland ringlet butterfly, Erebia medusa Fabricius (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) is one of the continental species that are supposed to be adversely affected by climate change, especially by rising winter temperatures. Here, we conduct an explorative study on the effects of low, moderate, and high winter temperatures on the pre-adult and adult stages of E.medusa in a laboratory experiment. Compared to the two other temperature regimes, the warm winter treatment led to an earlier termination of diapause and higher larval weights at the end of the winter, but significantly lower survival rates. The after-effects of the warm treatment included lower weight of the pupae and adult females, shorter forewings of adult males, and earlier emergence of both adult males and females. In natural environments, which are characterized by a much greater thermal variability and a much higher frequency of soil freeze-thaw events compared to our experiment, the effects of rising winter temperatures might be stronger than in this study. Thus, we conclude that warmer winters pose a non-negligible long-term threat to E.medusa.																	0013-8703	1570-7458				JUN	2014	151	3					270	279		10.1111/eea.12193								WOS:000335874400009						
J	Pozsgai, G; Littlewood, NA				Pozsgai, Gabor; Littlewood, Nick A.			Ground beetle (Coleoptera: Carabidae) population declines and phenological changes: Is there a connection?	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Long-term monitoring data were analyzed to reveal correlations between declining ground beetle (Coleoptera: Carabidae) populations and phenological changes at two Environmental Change Network sites in Scotland. The potential role of advancing phenology as an adaptation function in population stability was investigated. Analysis focussed on the 25 most abundant species over an 18 year sampling period. Pitfall trap catches were used to calculate mean activity-densities both for the whole sampling period and for dates limited to those within the activity period. Several phenological measurements were calculated (i.e. first day of appearance, peak activity date, median activity, length of activity and winter inactivity periods, and the last day of presence) for each species. Robust non-parametric estimation was used to model changes in both activity density and phenology. Eight species declined in activity density over time, three increased and fourteen showed no change. The mean rate of decline was greater than that of increase. Most of the species included in the analysis changed their phenology. Advancing onset of activity and earlier cessation were the most pronounced changes. However, a slow advancing trend in the peak activity was also shown. Only Nebria brevicollis, an autumn species with recorded winter activity, extended its activity period to later dates, suggesting that cessation of activity for the remaining species may be more closely linked to photoperiod. The earlier termination of activity shortened substantially the activity window for several species. Declines in activity density showed a strong relationship with a narrowing window of activity, mainly caused by earlier cessation of activity. Declining species were found more in bog or dry heather moorland habitats compared to grassland, emphasizing the vulnerability of these vegetation types, and associated insect assemblages depending on them, to environmental or climatic changes. The reciprocal relationship found between the trend of timing of initiation of activity and changes in activity-densities suggests that populations with a higher capacity to advance their phenology are less prone to decline. Since phenological changes may drive changes in populations, investigating phenological variables is encouraged in both research and conservation planning. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Photoperiodic response curves showed that the critical day length for diapause induction was 14 h 30 min, 14 h 25 min and 13 h 30 min at 22, 25 and 28 degrees C, respectively. The photoperiodic responses under non-24 h light-dark cycles demonstrated that night length played an essential role in the determination of diapause. Experiments using a short day length interrupted by a 1-h light pulse exhibited two troughs of diapause inhibition and the effect of diapause inhibition was greater in the early scotophase than in the late scotophase. The diapause-inducing short day lengths of 8, 10 and 12 h evoked greater intensities of diapause than did 13 and 14 h. Diapause can be terminated without exposure to chilling, but chilling at 5 degrees C for 90 and 120 d significantly accelerated diapause development, reduced mortality, and synchronized adult emergence. Additionally, the potential for H. cunea from the temperate region (Qingdao) to emerge and overwinter under field conditions in subtropical regions (Nanchang) of China was evaluated. Pupae that were transferred to Nanchang in early July showed a 60% survival rate and extremely dispersed pupal period (from 12 to 82 days), suggesting that some pupae may undergo summer diapause. Diapausing temperate region pupae that were moved out-of-doors in Nanchang during October showed approximately 20% overwintering survival; moreover, those pupae that overwintered successfully emerged the next spring during a period when their host plants would be available. The results indicate that this moth has the potential to expand its range into subtropical regions of China.																	1932-6203					MAY 30	2014	9	5							e98145	10.1371/journal.pone.0098145								WOS:000338101500032	24878546

Therefore, this study is focused on investigating the activity of adult stages of the species during weather changes occurring in winter months in eastern Poland, i.e. a period of tick diapause. Methods: D. reticulatus ticks were collected in a meadow ecosystem near Lublin (eastern Poland, 51 degrees 36'N, 22 degrees 58'E) between the third decade of November 2011 and the third decade of January 2012. During each collection, temperature and humidity were measured at the soil surface and at a height of 25 cm and the differences (delta) in the parameters between the two measurement points were calculated. Results: During one hour of our observation, from 0 to 42 specimens were collected, with the greatest numbers (25-40 specimens) between late November and mid-December. The activity of adult D. reticulatus (females and males in total) depended on soil and air temperature (r = -0.6986, p < 0.05). Soil and air humidity did not exert an impact on the questing behaviour of adult stages. In turn, the greater the moisture delta between these two measurement points was, the greater the activity of the adult tick stages was observed. Our investigations have demonstrated differences in the questing behaviour between D. reticulatus females and males correlated with environmental conditions. The temperatures of soil and air increased the migratory activity in females but did not affect migration of male ticks. In turn, the deltas of temperatures (r = -0.6986, p < 0.05) and humidity (r = 0.6829, p < 0.05) did not have a statistically significant effect on stimulation of female activity but they induced significant changes on the behaviour of males, for which we found a highly negative correlation between the number of active specimens and the temperature delta (r = -0.7276, p < 0.05) and a highly positive correlation with the humidity delta (r = 0.8199, p < 0.01). Conclusions: Weather changes can be accompanied by activity of adult D. reticulatus even in their winter diapause period. Therefore, there is an increased threat to human and animal health posed by tick-borne diseases.																	1756-3305					MAY 28	2014	7								245	10.1186/1756-3305-7-245								WOS:000336925900002	24885216

M.; Hendriks, A. Jan			Modeling the Impacts of Multiple Environmental Stress Factors on Estuarine Copepod Populations	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Many studies have focused on natural stress factors that shape the spatial and temporal distribution of calanoid copepods, but bioassays have shown that copepods are also sensitive to a broad range of contaminants. Although both anthropogenic and natural stress factors are obviously at play in natural copepod communities, most studies consider only one or the other. In the present investigation, we modeled the combined impact of both anthropogenic and natural stress factors on copepod populations. The model was applied to estimate Eurytemora affinis densities in the contaminated Scheldt estuary and the relatively uncontaminated Dar beta-Zingst estuary in relation to temperature, salinity, chlorophyll a, and sediment concentrations of cadmium, copper, and zinc. The results indicated that temperature was largely responsible for seasonal fluctuations of E. affinis densities. Our model results further suggested that exposure to zinc and copper was largely responsible for the reduced population densities in the contaminated estuary. The model provides a consistent framework for integrating and quantifying the impacts of multiple anthropogenic and natural stress factors on copepod populations. It facilitates the extrapolation of laboratory experiments to ecologically relevant end points pertaining to population viability.

The comparative proteomics studies revealed 26 proteins with changes on the expression in the resting cysts, including 12 specific proteins and 14 differential proteins. 12 specific proteins and 10 out of the 14 differential proteins were selected and identified by MALDI-TOF MS. The identified specific proteins with known functions included type II cytoskeletal 1, keratin, Nop16 domain containing protein, protein arginine n-methyltransferase, epsilon-trimethyllysine hydroxylase and calpain-like protein. The identified differential proteins with known functions included Lysozyme C, keratinocyte growth factor, lysozyme homolog AT-2, formate acetyltransferase, alpha S1 casein and cold-shock protein. We discussed the functions of these proteins as well as their contribution in the process of encystment. These identified proteins covered a wide range of molecular functions, including gene regulation, RNA regulation, proteins degradation and oxidation resistance, stress response, material transport and cytoskeleton organization. Therefore, differential expression of these proteins was essential for cell morphological and physiological changes during encystment. This suggested that the peculiar proteins and differential proteins might play important roles in the process of the vegetative cells transforming into the resting cysts. These observations may be novel findings that bring new insights into the detailed mechanisms of dormancy.																	1932-6203					MAY 16	2014	9	5							e97362	10.1371/journal.pone.0097362								WOS:000339614800040	24837719					
J	Langer, F; Fietz, J				Langer, Franz; Fietz, Joanna			Ways to measure body temperature in the field	JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY												Body temperature (T-b) represents one of the key parameters in ecophysiological studies with focus on energy saving strategies. In this study we therefore comparatively evaluated the usefulness of two types of temperature-sensitive passive transponders (LifeChips and IPTT-300) and one data logger (iButton, DS1922L) mounted onto a collar to measure T-b in the field. First we tested the accuracy of all three devices in a water bath with water temperature ranging from 0 to 40 degrees C. Second, we evaluated the usefulness of the LifeChips and the modified iButtons for measuring T-b of small heterothermic mammals under field conditions. For this work we subcutaneously implanted 14 male edible dormice (Glis glis) with transponders, and equipped another 14 males with data loggers to simultaneously record T-b and oxygen consumption with a portable oxygen analyzer (Oxbox). In one individual we recorded T-b with both devices and analyzed recorded T-b patterns. LifeChips are able to measure temperature within the smallest range from 25 to 40 degrees C with an accuracy of 0.07 +/- 0.12 C. IPTT-300 transponders measured temperature between 10 and 40 degrees C, but accuracy decreased considerably at values below 30 degrees C, with maximal deviations of nearly 7 degrees C. An individual calibration of each transponder is therefore needed, before using it at low TbS. The accuracy of the data logger was comparatively good (0.12 +/- 0.25 degrees C) and stable over the whole temperature range tested (0-40 degrees). In all three devices, the repeatability of measurements was high. LifeChip transponders as well as modified iButtons measured T-b reliably under field conditions. Simultaneous T-b-recordings in one edible dormouse with an implanted LifeChip and a collar-mounted iButton revealed that values of both measurements were closely correlated. Taken together, we conclude that implanted temperature-sensitive transponders represent an appropriate and largely non-invasive method to measure Tb also under field conditions.

J	Sousa-Baena, MS; Garcia, LC; Peterson, AT				Sousa-Baena, Mariane S.; Garcia, Leticia Couto; Peterson, A. Townsend			Knowledge behind conservation status decisions: Data basis for "Data Deficient" Brazilian plant species	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Methods for evaluating risk of biodiversity loss are linked closely to decisions about species' conservation status, which in turn depend on data documenting species' distributions, population status, and natural history. In Brazil, the scientific community and government have differing points of view regarding which plant species have insufficient data to be accorded a formal threat category, with the official list of threatened flora published by the Brazilian Ministry of Environment listing many fewer species as Data Deficient than a broader list prepared by a large, knowledgeable group of taxonomists. This paper aims to evaluate, using diverse analyses, whether "Digital Accessible Knowledge" is genuinely lacking or insufficient for basic characterization of distributions for 934 angiosperm species classified as Data Deficient on Brazil's official list. Analyses were based on large-scale databases of information associated with herbarium specimens, as part of the speciesLink network. Evaluating these species in terms of completeness of geographic range knowledge accumulated through time, our results show that at least 40.9% of species listed as Data Deficient do not appear genuinely to be particularly lacking in data, but rather may be knowledge-deficient: data exist that can provide rich information about the species, but such data remain unanalyzed and dormant for conservation decision-making. Such approaches may be useful in identifying cases in which data are genuinely lacking regarding conservation status of species, as well as in moving species out of Data Deficient categories and into appropriate threat status classifications.

J	Singh, NS; Dixit, AS				Singh, Namram Sushindrajit; Dixit, Anand Shanker			Participation of endogenous circadian rhythm in photoperiodic time measurement during ovarian responses of the subtropical tree sparrow, Passer montanus	INDIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY												Resonance experiment was employed to investigate the mechanism of photoperiodic time measurement during initiation of ovarian growth and functions in the subtropical population of female tree sparrow (Passer montanus) at Shillong (Latitude 25 degrees 34'N, Longitude 91 degrees 53'E). Photosensitive birds were subjected to various resonance light dark cycles of different durations such as: 12-(6L:6D), 24-(6L:18D), 36-(6L:30D), 48-(6L:42D), 60-(6L:54D) and 72-(6L:66D) h along with a control group under long days (14L: 10D) for 35 days. Birds, exposed to long days, exhibited ovarian growth confirming their photosensitivity at the beginning of the experiment. The birds experiencing resonance light/dark cycles of 12, 36 and 60 h responded well while those exposed to24, 48 and 72 h cycles did not. Serum levels of estradiol-17 beta ran almost parallel to changes in the follicular size. Further, histomorphometric analyses of ovaries of the birds subjected to various resonance light dark cycles revealed distinct correlation with the ovarian growth and the serum levels of estradiol-17 beta. No significant change in body weight was observed in the birds under any of the light regimes. The results are in agreement with the avian external coincidence model of photoperiodic time measurement and indicate that an endogenous circadian rhythm is involved during the initiation of the gonadal growth and functions in the female tree sparrow.																	0019-5189	0975-1009				MAY	2014	52	5					496	503										WOS:000335629000015	24851412

Geographic variation in winter hardiness of a common agricultural pest, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, the Colorado potato beetle	EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY												Successful latitudinal expansions into temperate climates depend largely upon the evolution of novel adaptive traits or the presence of pre-adaptive or exapted mechanisms for survival in seasonal climates. Geographic comparisons of ancestral (pre-expansion) and derived (post-expansion) populations provide a useful framework for understanding the evolutionary conditions that facilitate geographic expansions. Using a common agricultural pest, the Colorado Potato Beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) as a model, we conducted a regional comparison of cold hardiness and overwintering success among ancestral (southern Mexico) and derived (Vermont and Kansas, USA) L. decemlineata populations. In order to determine if ancestral and derived beetle populations vary physiologically for cold hardiness, we compared supercooling points (SCPs) of three geographic populations of L. decemlineata. We also tested if ancestral and derived beetle populations differed in their overwintering behavior and success by performing an overwintering field experiment. Ancestral and derived populations did not express different physiological responses (i.e. SCPs) to freezing temperatures. However, ancestral and derived populations responded differently to the onset of winter conditions and displayed dissimilar overwintering behaviors. The majority of ancestral beetles failed to initiate diapause and dug upward within experimental mesocosms. Differences in overwintering behavior also resulted in significant variation in overwintering success as derived populations displayed higher overwintering survivorship when compared with ancestral populations. Given our results, it is evident that research exploring the interaction of the ecological factors and evolutionary processes is necessary to fully realize the dynamics of biological invasions.

Genome-wide single-generation signatures of local selection in the panmictic European eel	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Next-generation sequencing and the collection of genome-wide data allow identifying adaptive variation and footprints of directional selection. Using a large SNP data set from 259 RAD-sequenced European eel individuals (glass eels) from eight locations between 34 and 64(o)N, we examined the patterns of genome-wide genetic diversity across locations. We tested for local selection by searching for increased population differentiation using F-ST-based outlier tests and by testing for significant associations between allele frequencies and environmental variables. The overall low genetic differentiation found (F-ST=0.0007) indicates that most of the genome is homogenized by gene flow, providing further evidence for genomic panmixia in the European eel. The lack of genetic substructuring was consistent at both nuclear and mitochondrial SNPs. Using an extensive number of diagnostic SNPs, results showed a low occurrence of hybrids between European and American eel, mainly limited to Iceland (5.9%), although individuals with signatures of introgression several generations back in time were found in mainland Europe. Despite panmixia, a small set of SNPs showed high genetic differentiation consistent with single-generation signatures of spatially varying selection acting on glass eels. After screening 50354 SNPs, a total of 754 potentially locally selected SNPs were identified. Candidate genes for local selection constituted a wide array of functions, including calcium signalling, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction and circadian rhythm. Remarkably, one of the candidate genes identified is PERIOD, possibly related to differences in local photoperiod associated with the >30 degrees difference in latitude between locations. Genes under selection were spread across the genome, and there were no large regions of increased differentiation as expected when selection occurs within just a single generation due to panmixia. This supports the conclusion that most of the genome is homogenized by gene flow that removes any effects of diversifying selection from each new generation.

Unlike other regions, HCRs have much more significant and diverse photoperiods and temperature conditions over seasons or across latitudes, and HCR soybeans released there show rich diversity in maturity traits. However, HCR soybeans have not been as well classified into maturity groups (MGs) as other places. Therefore, it is necessary to identify MGs in HCRs and to genotype the maturity loci. Methods: Local varieties were collected from the northern part of Northeast China and the far-eastern region of Russia. Maturity group reference (MGR) soybeans of MGs MG000, MG00, and MG0 were used as references during field experiments. Both local varieties and MGR soybeans were planted for two years (2010-2011) in Heihe (N 50 degrees 15', E 127 degrees 27', H 168.5 m), China. The days to VE (emergence), R1 (beginning bloom) and R7 (beginning maturity) were recorded and statistically analyzed. Furthermore, some varieties were further genotyped at four molecularly-identified maturity loci E1, E2, E3 and E4. Results: The HCR varieties were classified into MG0 or even more early-maturing. In Heihe, some varieties matured much earlier than MG000, which is the most early-maturing known MG, and clustered into a separate group. We designated the group as MG0000, following the convention of MGs. HCR soybeans had relatively stable days to beginning bloom from emergence. The HCR varieties diversified into genotypes of E1, E2, E3 and E4. These loci had different effects on maturity. Conclusion: HCRs diversify early-maturing MGs of soybean. MG0000, a new MG that matures much earlier than known MGs, was developed. HCR soybean breeding should focus more on shortening post-flowering reproductive growth. E1, E2, E3, and E4 function differentially.																	1932-6203					APR 16	2014	9	4							e94139	10.1371/journal.pone.0094139								WOS:000336863900034	24740097

In the present study, the NH was found to be the major region for growing pearl millet landraces (80.5%). More landraces were found at lower latitudes (< 20 degrees) in both hemispheres than at higher latitudes. The latitude range of 10 degrees-15 degrees in the NH and 15 degrees-20 degrees in the SH were found to be important source regions for the prevalence of pearl millet, with 39.6% and 13.1% in the world collection of landraces, respectively. Landraces from lower-latitude regions on either side of the equator varied widely for all traits. Landraces from the 5 degrees-10 degrees N latitude region flowered late and grew tall in the rainy and post-rainy seasons and produced more tillers. Landraces from the 10 degrees-15 degrees N latitude region produced few tillers and had long and thick panicles with larger seeds. Long-bristled bird-resistant landraces were considerable at latitudes of 10 degrees-15 degrees S and 20 degrees-25 degrees S. The minimum temperature at the collection sites was found to be one of the important factors for determining the patterns of the prevalence of pearl millet across the latitudes. Late-maturing, tall and high-tillering landraces from lower-latitude regions were better sources for fodder production. Early-maturing landraces producing long and thick panicles with large seeds from mid-latitude regions (15 degrees-20 degrees) in both hemispheres were useful for developing high-yielding cultivars. Using the latitudinal patterns of diversity in pearl millet landraces, missions may be launched to explore high-diversity, under-collected and threatened areas for the collection of materials of interest at latitudes of 15 degrees-20 degrees.

The identification of sweet cherry rootstocks using morphological traits is almost impossible particularly during the dormant season, yet it is very important for the grower to know exactly the rootstock as this has a major influence on cultivar performance and agricultural practices. However, DNA-based molecular analysis carried out on actively growing shoot tips, leaves or dormant buds provides a good opportunity to reliably distinguish the rootstocks. Herein, we have integrated high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis, coupled with five simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, in order to facilitate the identification of the most popular sweet cherry rootstocks in Greece. The five SSR loci used were highly informative and generated a unique melting curve profile of microsatellites for each of the six sweet cherry rootstocks tested. In particular, one marker, BPPCT002, with six HRM profiles was sufficient to discriminate all the sweet cherry rootstocks studied, highlighting its potential use for rootstock identification. Hence, this assay provided a flexible, cost-effective and closed-tube microsatellite genotyping method well suited to sweet cherry rootstock identification.																	1479-2621	1479-263X				APR	2014	12	1					160	163		10.1017/S1479262113000403								WOS:000342666200020						
J	Shaw, P; Cresswell, W				Shaw, Phil; Cresswell, Will			Latitudinal variation in day length and working day length has a confounding effect when comparing nest attentiveness in tropical and temperate species	JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												During incubation, tropical passerines have been shown to have lower levels of nest attentiveness than their counterparts at north temperate latitudes, spending a higher percentage of daylight time off the nest. This difference has been interpreted as evidence of parental restraint; tropical birds allocate more time to daily self-maintenance, perhaps preserving their higher annual survival rates and future breeding potential. But such comparisons are susceptible to the confounding effects of day length variation, because a given amount of time spent off the nest will account for a greater percentage of daylight time near to the equator than at high latitudes during spring and summer. Based on a pattern of increasing day length between 0 degrees and 70 degrees N, we show that the impact of this bias is likely to be small where sites are separated by less than 30 degrees-40 degrees of latitude, but should increase substantially both with latitudinal span and distance from the equator. To illustrate this effect, we compared nest attentiveness in two congeners breeding at 1 degrees S and 52 degrees N. During incubation, Stripe-breasted Tits Parus fasciiventer in Uganda had a shorter working day (time from emerging to retiring) than north temperate Great Tits P. major, and spent a higher percentage of daylight time off the nest (32 %) than Great Tits in the UK (24 %). However, this difference was almost wholly explained by the latitudinal difference in day length; the amount of time spent off the nest differed by just 10 min day(-1) (<1 % of the 24-h cycle). We show that this effect may be moderated by the change in working day length, which increased less rapidly (in relation to latitude) than day length. Although these effects can thus confound latitudinal comparisons of nest attentiveness, accentuating a pattern predicted by life-history theory, they are avoidable if attentiveness is expressed as the percentage of time or the number of minutes spent incubating per 24 h.																	0021-8375	1439-0361				APR	2014	155	2					481	489		10.1007/s10336-013-1029-1								WOS:000337792000016

We studied genetic variance in life history traits and their reaction norms in response to manipulated photoperiods in central, northern, and northernmost peripheral populations of the damselfly Lestes sponsa (Hansemann). After the central-marginal hypothesis, it is predicted that central populations will express the highest genetic variance. Northern and northernmost populations showed the highest development and growth rates. All populations expressed shorter development and accelerated growth when raised in a northern compared with a central latitude photoperiod. The slopes of reaction norms differed between regions resulting in a region-by-photoperiod interaction. There was genetic variation in development time; however, it did not differ across regions. There was no genetic variation in growth rate or in the plasticity of development time and growth rate to photoperiod. Results did not support the central-marginal hypothesis. However, evidence was found that the development time has the potential to evolve at similar rates across study regions. In contrast, the growth rate seems to be genetically constrained for further evolution, probably because of a strong past directional selection on this trait. The presence of low genetic variation in the slope of the reaction norms could be a result of stabilising selection imposed by seasonality.

A high-resolution mapping approach combined with mutant analysis revealed a cereal ortholog of Arabidopsis thaliana LUX ARRHYTHMO/PHYTOCLOCK 1 (LUX/PCL1) as a promising candidate for the earliness per se 3 (Eps-3A(m)) locus in einkorn wheat (Triticum monococcum L.). Using delayed fluorescence measurements it was shown that Eps-3A(m) containing einkorn wheat accession KT3-5 had a distorted circadian clock. The hypothesis was subsequently confirmed by performing a time course study on central and output circadian clock genes, which showed arrhythmic transcript patterns in KT3-5 under constant ambient conditions, i.e., constant light and temperature. It was also demonstrated that variation in spikelet number between wild-type and mutants is sensitive to temperature, becoming negligible at 25 degrees. These observations lead us to propose that the distorted clock is causative for both early flowering and variation in spike size and spikelet number, and that having a dysfunctional LUX could have neutral, or even positive, effects in warmer climates. To test the latter hypothesis we ascertained sequence variation of LUX in a range of wheat germplasm. We observed a higher variation in the LUX sequence among accessions coming from the warmer climate and a unique in-frame mutation in early-flowering Chinese T. turgidum cultivar 'Tsing Hua no. 559.' Our results emphasize the importance of the circadian clock in temperate cereals as a promising target for adaptation to new environments.

J	Wan, XR; Zhang, XJ; Wang, GM; Chen, LJ				Wan, Xinrong; Zhang, Xinjie; Wang, Guiming; Chen, Lijun			Optimal body weight of Brandt's voles for winter survival	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Winter survival is an important fitness component of non-hibernating small mammals in northern latitudes. Body sizes are related to many life history traits influencing the fitness of animals. Counter-balancing selective forces of survival selection may optimize autumn body weight to maximize winter survival of non-hibernating small mammals. Brandt's voles (Lasiopodomys brandtii) are non-hibernating and live in groups year round. We live trapped Brandt's voles in an enclosure and estimated weekly survival probabilities and daily proportional body weight growth rates of the voles from September 2003 to March 2004. Autumn body weight as an individual covariate explained about 43% of variation in autumn spring survival of the voles. Survival of females and males peaked at body weight of about 33 g and 51 g, respectively, supporting stabilizing survival selection on body sizes of Brandt's voles. However, breeding selection may reduce the optimal body size of female voles. Brandt's voles did not lose body weight during the autumn and winter probably to enhance winter survival. Therefore, Brandt's voles adapt to the energetically demanding winter environments with optimal body size and maximized winter survival. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Latitudinal cline in allele length provides evidence for selection in a circadian rhythm gene	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY												Divergent natural selection across a heterogeneous landscape can drive the evolution of locally adapted populations in which phenotypic variation is fine-tuned to the environment. At the molecular level, such processes can be inferred by identifying correlations between genetic variation and environmental variables. We demonstrate that allele length and allele frequency at a regulatory circadian rhythm gene, OtsClock1b, are highly correlated (R-2 = 0.86, P = 1.25 x 10(-5)) with latitude (a surrogate for photoperiod) in kokanee, the freshwater resident form of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). Two OtsClock1b alleles were identified that differed in length by seven amino acids, with the frequency of the shorter allele increasing from 50% in southern British Columbia (49 degrees N) to complete fixation in Alaska (62 degrees N). No such associations were detected for neutral microsatellite loci. In addition, a kokanee population sampled from Kamchatka, Russia (55 degrees N) fits within the North American latitudinal cline, suggesting that this pattern may be convergent across large longitudinal spatial scales. This correlation provides evidence that natural selection rather than demographic processes may drive the distribution of genetic variation at OtsClock1b in kokanee.

Using a combination of field observations and a caged field experiment, we explored the roles of environmental and individual variation on the formation of mating aggregations and mating success in the buprestid beetle Capnodis tenebrionis (Linnaeus, 1767), a pest species of stone fruit trees. Our field observations revealed that the formation of aggregations is influenced by a range of environmental factors including temperature, photoperiod, and population density. However, aggregations were not at random and were more likely to occur on the section of the plant with highest incidence of solar radiation and thus higher temperatures. Data from our experiment with caged beetles in the field further indicate that the reproductive behavior of this species varies with temperature. The probability of a successful mating occurring was also positively related to both male and female size. Females of C. tenebrionis mate several times over a 4-h period, but generally not with the same male. Information obtained from these studies is useful to define the most appropriate time for pest control, especially adopting strategies that interfere with reproduction.

Thermal biology of the spider mite predator Phytoseiulus macropilis	BIOCONTROL												Phytoseiulus macropilis Banks (Acari: Phytoseiidae) is a specialist predator of the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae), and has been used to control the pest in its native range: Mediterranean regions, the tropics and Florida, USA. This study investigates the thermal biology as a proxy for establishment potential of glasshouse escapees in cooler northern European climates, using a combination of laboratory and field trials. High mortality rates at 10 A degrees C indicated limited acclimation ability. Mites displayed continuous oviposition in conditions that have previously been shown to induce a hiatus in other phytoseiid species, supporting previous findings that Phytoseiulus is a genus with no diapause state. Adult P. macropilis supercooled to between -17.2 and -24.0 A degrees C, but the lower lethal temperature(50) was -5.7 A degrees C, resulting in a high level of pre-freeze mortality. The lethal time(50) at 5 A degrees C was 2.6 days, and maximum survival in winter field trials across 2010 and 2011 was 21 days. The thermal biology data indicate that P. macropilis is unlikely to establish in northern Europe, and will therefore make a suitable glasshouse biological control agent in temperate climates.																	1386-6141	1573-8248				APR	2014	59	2					205	217		10.1007/s10526-014-9559-x								WOS:000333199600008

On the other hand, an extreme phenotype associated with a given trait implies the potential involvement of a particular allele in various allelic interactions. A genetic factor associated with such an extreme phenotype may frequently be identified from various genetic populations consisting of different parental combinations. In this study, we attempted to uncover the genetic factor associated with extremely early heading date in rice, using various F2 populations. Heading date in rice has been characterized by at least 19 QTLs, from which 12 genes have been identified. A58, a rice strain with an extremely early heading date, is adapted to Hokkaido, the northernmost limit of rice cultivation. Six F2 populations derived from crosses of A58 with six other strains displayed a range of heading dates. Genotyping using 19 QTL markers indicated that the A58 allele of the Ghd7 locus was present in most F2 individuals exhibiting extremely early heading dates. This analysis also demonstrated that when the wild-type Ehd1 allele was present, the Ghd7 allele from A58 accelerated floral induction. The results of this study demonstrate that assorted F2 populations are valuable materials for comprehensive genotyping to explore major genetic factors for extreme phenotypes, and that this methodology is broadly applicable to other unknown traits.

Factors affecting host range in a generalist seed pathogen of semi-arid shrublands	PLANT ECOLOGY												Generalist pathogens can exhibit differential success on different hosts, resulting in complex host range patterns. Several factors operate to reduce realized host range relative to potential host range, particularly under field conditions. We explored factors influencing host range of the naturally occurring generalist ascomycete grass seed pathogen Pyrenophora semeniperda. We measured potential host range in laboratory experiments at high inoculum loads with 26 grass species, including the primary host Bromus tectorum, and developed models to predict susceptibility and tolerance based on host traits, including germination speed, seed hardness, seed size, and phylogenetic relations. We also examined pathogen and host density effects on infection and mortality. All species tested were at least somewhat susceptible to the pathogen at high inoculum loads, but both infection and mortality varied widely. Species more closely related to the original host (B. tectorum) were more susceptible to infection, whereas species with slower germination were less tolerant and therefore more likely to suffer mortality. Infection and mortality were sharply reduced as inoculum load was reduced. Intermediate loads had major negative impacts on dormant B. tectorum seeds but generally minimal effects on native species. In addition, field seed bank studies determined that P. semeniperda rarely exploits native grass species as hosts. This marked reduction in realized host range relative to potential host range indicates that laboratory host range studies are potentially a poor predictor of either the current or possible future realized host range for wildland plant pathogens.

J	Volis, S				Volis, Sergei			Dormancy-Related Seed Positional Effect in Two Populations of an Annual Grass from Locations of Contrasting Aridity	PLOS ONE												In grasses, variation in seed size and dormancy often results from a seed's position within a dispersal unit. In this paper, I asked whether seed positional effect within a spikelet contributes to ecotypic differentiation between two populations of Avena sterilis having different species range position and associated aridity. I created experimental seed banks in which germination of seeds (florets) having different positions within a spikelet was examined over three years. In addition, two germination tests were conducted under controlled conditions. The two populations were found to have a short-living soil seed bank due to sequential germination of the florets. Although positional seed dormancy effect in A. sterilis does not appear to be a specific desert adaptation against unpredictability of rainfall events, this trait does contribute to ecotypic differentiation between desert and Mediterranean populations. Consistent with bet hedging buffering against rainfall unpredictability, germination fractions in the first year were higher in the Mediterranean than in the desert population, while seeds of the desert origin had stronger dormancy and more sequential germination of florets.																	1932-6203					MAR 27	2014	9	3							e93061	10.1371/journal.pone.0093061								WOS:000333677500068	24675719

Each species has a certain depth range within which different individuals (of the same life stage and sex) are found. Lipids are accumulated in many calanoid copepods for energy storage and reproduction. Lipid content in some species increases with depth, however studies so far focused mostly on temperate and high-latitude seasonal vertically migrating copepods and compared lipid contents among individuals either from coarse layers or between diapausing, deep-dwelling copepods and individuals found in the photic, near-surface layer. Here we examined whether lipid contents of individual calanoid copepods of the same species, life stage/sex differ between finer depth layers within the upper water column of subtropical and Arctic seas. A total of 6 calanoid species were collected from samples taken at precise depths within the photic layer in both cold eutrophic and warm oligotrophic environments using SCUBA diving, MOCNESS and Multinet. Measurements of lipid content were obtained from digitized photographs of the collected individuals. The results revealed significant differences in lipid content across depth differences as small as 12-15 meters for Mecynocera clausi C5 and Ctenocalanus vanus C5 (Red Sea), Clausocalanus furcatus males and two clausocalanid C5s (Mediterranean Sea), and Calanus glacialis C5 (Arctic). We suggest two possible explanations for the differences in lipid content with depth on such a fine scale: predator avoidance and buoyancy.																	1932-6203					MAR 25	2014	9	3							e92935	10.1371/journal.pone.0092935								WOS:000333675600107	24667529

It is thought that soil microbes, likely actinomycetes, serve as the main global sink for tropospheric H-2. However, no study has ever unambiguously proven that a hydrogenase can oxidize this trace gas. In this work, we demonstrate, by using genetic dissection and sensitive GC measurements, that the soil actinomycete Mycobacterium smegmatis mc(2)155 constitutively oxidizes subtropospheric concentrations of H-2. We show that two membrane-associated, oxygen-dependent [NiFe] hydrogenases mediate this process. Hydrogenase-1 (Hyd1) (MSMEG_2262-2263) is well-adapted to rapidly oxidize H-2 at a range of concentrations [V-max(app) = 12 nmol.g.dw(-1).min(-1); K-m(app) = 180 nM; threshold = 130 pM in the Delta hyd23 (Hyd1 only) strain], whereas Hyd2 (MSMEG_2719-2720) catalyzes a slower-acting, higher-affinity process [V-max(app) = 2.5 nmol.g.dw(-1).min(-1); K-m(app) = 50 nM; threshold = 50 pM in the Delta hyd13 (Hyd2 only) strain]. These observations strongly support previous studies that have linked group 5 [NiFe] hydrogenases (e. g., Hyd2) to the oxidation of tropospheric H-2 in soil ecosystems. We further reveal that group 2a [NiFe] hydrogenases (e.g., Hyd1) can contribute to this process. Hydrogenase expression and activity increases in carbon-limited cells, suggesting that scavenging of trace H-2 helps to sustain dormancy. Distinct physiological roles for Hyd1 and Hyd2 during the adaptation to this condition are proposed. Soil organisms harboring high-affinity hydrogenases may be especially competitive, given that they harness a highly dependable fuel source in otherwise unstable environments.

J	Duckworth, GD; Altwegg, R				Duckworth, Gregory Duncan; Altwegg, Res			Environmental drivers of an urban Hadeda Ibis population	ARDEA												Weather and habitat-use are key factors that influence the survival of a species. A central goal in conservation biology is to gain a mechanistic understanding of how these quantities limit a species' range. We examined how weather, season and geographic location influenced the demographic rates of an urban population of Hadeda Ibises Bostrychia hagedash on the leading edge of its expanding range in the Western Cape of South Africa. The Hadeda Ibis has increased its South African range 2.5 times within the last 50 years and is now a common urban resident throughout most of the country. Using capture-mark-recapture and generalized linear models, we build upon previous demographic analyses of this species. Our results show no significant influence of weather on demographic rates. Rainfall triggered the onset of the main breeding season (although breeding pairs were found at any time throughout the year), and Hadeda Ibises adjusted their breeding phenology according to the rainfall season of the areas into which they expanded. There was no evidence of spatial correlation within the study area. Hadedas have quickly adapted well to urban areas outside of their original range. Because weather had little effect on Hadeda demographics we suggest that urban areas may potentially buffer unfavourable effects of weather on Hadeda survival and are an important factor in the successful range expansion. This finding is consistent with the explanations of range expansions of other ibis species throughout the world.																	0373-2266	2213-1175				SPR	2014	102	1					21	29		10.5253/078.102.0104								WOS:000340807500004

For this reason, breeding programs need to be initiated using knowledge regarding the genetic influence on floral biological traits. The objective of the present study was to characterize the genotypic variation in flowering and panicle architecture traits in Miscanthus by studying (i) the clone effect on these traits and (ii) the clone sensitivity to environmental conditions. The flowering traits characterized were date of panicle emergence, date of flowering onset, and interval between these two traits. The panicle architecture traits characterized were total panicle length, longest panicle raceme size, raceme number per panicle, floral density, and total flower number per panicle. Eight clones were studied in a greenhouse under four environmental conditions including two day lengths (an 8-h short day length and a natural day length) and two temperature treatments (warm and cool). Miscanthus clones showed large differences in flowering and panicle architecture traits. Moreover, day length appeared to be the most important environmental factor creating differential clone sensitivities for the panicle emergence and the onset of flowering in contrast to temperature factor for the total flower number per panicle. In addition, the behavior of the clone Sacc was in contrast with that of the other clones for most of the traits studied. This knowledge will be useful to optimize the synchronization of flowering between Miscanthus clones for more successful breeding programs.																	1939-1234	1939-1242				MAR	2014	7	1					430	441		10.1007/s12155-013-9381-9								WOS:000332484000038

Investigating potential determinants of the distribution limits of a savanna woody plant: Colophospermum mopane	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions Early bioclimatic models predict that climate change in southern African savannas will cause a huge southward and westward range shift of the savanna tree Colophospermum mopane (Kirk ex Benth.) Kirk ex J.Leon. C.mopane is an economically and ecologically important subtropical savanna tree that forms mono-dominant stands across 30% of southern African savannas. We investigate the validity of these initial range expansion predictions to answer the following questions: what are the regional-scale drivers of the distribution of C.mopane in southern African savannas; and what are the landscape-scale distribution patterns of this species? Location Central Lowveld, Kruger National Park, South Africa. Methods We investigate the validity of very early range expansion modelling predictions using a regional-scale, climate envelope niche model, and fine-scale field mapping of the current boundary, to understand which environmental variables may determine the distribution limit of this signature species. Results Our findings indicate that both non-climatic (dry season day length) and climatic (minimum temperatures) variables limit the regional distribution of C.mopane. At the landscape scale, the distribution of this species is restricted to the warmer parts of the landscape, suggesting minimum temperature appears to be the primary factor determining its landscape-scale distribution. Conclusions This study provides the first detailed model of environmental factors that may limit the regional distribution of C.mopane, and allows us to formulate testable hypotheses regarding the determinants of the range of a keystone species.

Osmoregulation and growth in offspring of wild Atlantic salmon at different temperatures	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												In order to investigate how changes in gill Na+, K+-ATPase (NKA) alpha 1a, alpha 1b subunits, Na+, K+, 2Cl(-) cotransporter (NKCC1) and the apical cyctic fibrosis trans-membrane conductance regulator (CFTR-I) transcripts in wild Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, smolts are affected by temperature during spring Atlantic salmon parr (initial mean length 12.8 cm, s.d. = 0.6, mean mass 22.1 g, s.d. = 3.2) originating from the Vosso river (western Norway) were reared under three temperature regimes (5.1, 8.1 and 10.8 A degrees C) from March to May. The temperatures reflect the natural temperature range in the study river during late spring. Findings from the present study indicate that smolt development differs within same strains held at different temperatures. Hence an absolute lower temperature limit for smolt development in wild salmon may be difficult to define. Overall present findings indicate that the smolt window will be narrower in warmer water. A temperature controlled smolt window may signify serious implications for smolt survival in wild (i.e., if migrants are delayed by obstacles or if hatchery produced smolts are released to late).																	0378-1909	1573-5133				MAR	2014	97	3					285	296		10.1007/s10641-013-0151-5								WOS:000330350400007

Representation of Dormant and Active Microbial Dynamics for Ecosystem Modeling	PLOS ONE												Dormancy is an essential strategy for microorganisms to cope with environmental stress. However, global ecosystem models typically ignore microbial dormancy, resulting in notable model uncertainties. To facilitate the consideration of dormancy in these large-scale models, we propose a new microbial physiology component that works for a wide range of substrate availabilities. This new model is based on microbial physiological states and the major parameters are the maximum specific growth and maintenance rates of active microbes and the ratio of dormant to active maintenance rates. A major improvement of our model over extant models is that it can explain the low active microbial fractions commonly observed in undisturbed soils. Our new model shows that the exponentially-increasing respiration from substrate-induced respiration experiments can only be used to determine the maximum specific growth rate and initial active microbial biomass, while the respiration data representing both exponentially-increasing and non-exponentially-increasing phases can robustly determine a range of key parameters including the initial total live biomass, initial active fraction, the maximum specific growth and maintenance rates, and the half-saturation constant. Our new model can be incorporated into existing ecosystem models to account for dormancy in microbially-driven processes and to provide improved estimates of microbial activities.

Glenn			Nest Site Selection and Nesting Behavior of the Bee Lithurgopsis apicalis (Megachilidae: Lithurginae)	AMERICAN MUSEUM NOVITATES												This paper reports on the biology of Lithurgopsis apicalis (Cresson) that were found excavating nests in the dead and dying flower/seed stalks of Agave in southern Arizona. Females normally gain entry to the soft inner tissue of the stalk by seeking out naturally occurring longitudinal cracks in the hard outer surface of the stalk. Once inside they chew branching tunnels through the soft plant tissue, at the end of which are one or more extremely elongate brood cells. The cells were normally found to contain one or more eggs, each in a small empty pocket entirely within the provisions of soft pollen, which completely filled the cell. The attachment of the egg to the provisions is described, as is the egg itself. The first four larval instars remain attached to the provisions while the elongate fifth (final larval) instar is free from the provisions and starts defecating while still eating the food, which gradually intermixes with fecal pellets. Toward the end of defecation, larvae start spinning strands of silk to form cocoons. After finishing spinning, larvae enter diapause, becoming quiescent over a period of more than a week. However, when in diapause, they still react to touch by curling and uncurling their bodies unlike totally quiescent diapausing larvae of most bees. Cocoon structure and function are described. Throughout the paper, aspects of nesting biology of this species are compared with those. of other lithurgines. New details concerning the cocoon of Trichothurgus dubius (Sichel) are presented, and ovarian statistics for Lithurgopsis apicalis are appended.																	0003-0082	1937-352X				FEB 6	2014		3796					1	24										WOS:000331489900001						
J	Naranjo, L; Talon, M; Domingo, C				Naranjo, Laura; Talon, Manuel; Domingo, Concha			Diversity of floral regulatory genes of japonica rice cultivated at northern latitudes	BMC GENOMICS												Background: Rice is considered a short day plant. Originally from tropical regions rice has been progressively adapted to temperate climates and long day conditions in part by modulating its sensitivity to day length. Heading date 3a (Hd3a) and RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T 1 (RFT1) that code for florigens, are known as major regulatory genes of floral transition in rice. Both Hd3a and RFT1 are regulated by Early heading date 1 (Ehd1) and Days to heading on chromosome 2 (DTH2) while Heading date 1 (Hd1) also governs Hd3a expression. To investigate the mechanism of rice adaptation to temperate climates we have analyzed the natural variation of these five genes in a collection of japonica rice representing the genetic diversity of long day cultivated rice. Results: We have investigated polymorphisms of Hd3a, RFT1, Ehd1, Hd1 and DTH2 in a collection of 57 japonica varieties. Hd3a and RFT1 were highly conserved, displaying one major allele. Expression analysis suggested that RFT1 rather than Hd3a could be the pivotal gene controlling flowering under long day conditions. While few alleles were found in the Ehd1 promoter and DTH2 coding region, a high degree of variation in Hd1, including non-functional alleles, was observed. Correlation analysis between gene expression levels and flowering periods suggested the occurrence of other factors, additionally to Ehd1, affecting RFT1 regulation in long day adapted cultivars. Conclusions: During domestication, rice expansion was accompanied by changes in the regulatory mechanism of flowering. The existence of non-functional Hd1 alleles and the lack of correlation of their presence with flowering times in plants grown under long day conditions, indicate a minor role of this branch in this process and the existence of an alternative regulatory pathway in northern latitudes. Expression analysis data and a high degree of conservation of RFT1 suggested that this gene could be the main factor regulating flowering among japonica cultivars adapted to northern areas. In the absence of inhibition exerted by Hd1 through repression of Hd3a expression, the role of Ehd1 as a regulator of RFT1 and Hd3a appears to be reinforced. Data also indicated the occurrence of additional regulatory factors controlling flowering.

THE INTENSITY OF SELECTION ACTING ON THE COUCH POTATO GENE-SPATIAL-TEMPORAL VARIATION IN A DIAPAUSE CLINE	EVOLUTION												Cosmopolitan populations of Drosophila melanogaster have co-opted a form of reproductive diapause to overwinter in northern populations. Polymorphism in the couch potato gene has been implicated in genetic variation for this diapause trait. Using a collection of 20 populations from Florida to Canada and 11 collections from 3 years in a Pennsylvania orchard, we estimated the allele frequencies for 15 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the couch potato gene. These include the specific polymorphism associated with diapause inducability. We find that the SNP polymorphism, 48034(A/T), is correlated with latitude and its frequencies are predicted by the incidence of diapause trait. We find that the clinal patterns for cpo SNPs sampled in 1997 are similar to the same SNPs sampled in 2009-2010. SNPs that show apparent associations with cpo expression are also clinal with the low-expression allele increasing in frequency, as would be predicted from functional knockout studies of cpo. Finally, we see a significant pattern where the frequency of the diapause-causing allele drops in frequency during the summer season, consistent with the drop in the incidence of the diapause trait. The selection required to drive this response is large, roughly 24% to 59% per generation depending on the degree of dominance.

J	Juarez, L; Montana, C; Franco, M				Juarez, Lilian; Montana, Carlos; Franco, Miguel			The viability of two populations of the terrestrial orchid Cyclopogon luteoalbus in a fragmented tropical mountain cloud forest: Dormancy delays extinction	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Habitat fragmentation threatens the viability of increasingly isolated populations, particularly in species, such as orchids, with very specific requirements (e.g., pollination and germination). Many orchids undergo dormancy when conditions deteriorate and, if dormancy decreases the variability of population growth, it would be expected to buffer the negative impacts of disturbance/fragmentation. We investigated the effect of vegetative dormancy in delaying the effect of habitat fragmentation in two populations of the orchid Cyclopogon luteoalbus. Dormancy kept stochastic growth rate significantly higher than it would be if plants entering dormancy were to die instead. Time to 50% probability of quasi-extinction (95% reduction in population size) was 76-100 y when dormancy was taken into account, but 17-43 y when dormancy equalled death. The sign of the relative contribution (elasticity) that dormancy made to population growth differed between plants going dormant and plants re-sprouting, and between juveniles and adults. Consequently, the relationships between the elasticities of going dormant or re-sprouting and survival followed opposite trends, and the value of survival at which the two curves intercepted was higher for the population with the largest effect of dormancy on population growth. Conclusions: (i) dormancy delays the contribution that individuals make to population growth rate, but also the time to extinction, and (ii) both negative and positive effects of dormancy on population growth rate must be quantified to understand its overall contribution to fitness. Accurate quantification and management of vegetative dormancy is crucial for the conservation of plants possessing it. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

By transferring diapausing pupae induced under LD 11:13, LD 12:12 and LD 13:11 at 20, 22 and 25 degrees C to 25 degrees C combined with LD 15:9 to terminate diapause the rearing day length of 11h evoked greater intensity of diapause than did 12 and 13h at 25 degrees C; whereas the rearing temperature of 25 degrees C evoked more intense diapause than did 20 and 22 degrees C under LD 11:13. By transferring diapausing pupae induced under LD 12:12 at 20 and 22 degrees C to six temperatures of 18, 20, 22, 25, 28 and 31 degrees C combined with LD 15:9 to terminate diapause, the duration of diapause was significantly shortened from 146 days at 18 degrees C to 24 days at 31 degrees C, showing that high temperatures significantly accelerate diapause development. Furthermore, the duration of diapause was significantly longer at the rearing temperature of 22 degrees C than that at 20 degrees C when the diapause-terminating temperatures were 20 and 22 degrees C. Chilling at 5 degrees C did not shorten the duration of diapause but lengthened it when chilling period was included. However, chilling plays an important role in synchronizing adult emergence. Rearing temperature of 22 degrees C also evoked more intense diapause than did 20 degrees C in most chilling treatments. When the overwintering pupae were transferred at different times from natural temperatures to 25 degrees C, it was found that the earlier the transfer took place, the earlier the adults emerged when the time spent under natural conditions was included. However, cool temperatures before March showed an enhanced effect on diapause development at 20 degrees C, suggesting that the high diapause-terminating temperature can offset the effect of chilling on diapause development. The result of diapause termination under natural conditions suggests that the developmental threshold for post-diapause development in H. armigera should be around 17.5 degrees C.																	0007-4853	1475-2670				FEB	2014	104	1					12	18		10.1017/S0007485313000266								WOS:000332950800002	23651539

A time-varying distributed delay model, simulating the successive occurrences of egg hatching, nymph presence, and adult emergence, is extended here to represent multi-generation infestation patterns of grapevine plants inhabited by eggs, nymphs, and adults. The model extension includes intrinsic mortality, mortality caused by plant dormancy, and low temperatures, development of diapausing and post-diapausing eggs, fecundity rates, and adult longevity. Field observations and published data were used to estimate parameters. The model was validated with five years canopy infestation data from five vineyards not subjected to insecticide treatments and found to have satisfactory explicative and predictive qualities. The model output is most sensitive to a 10% variation in the upper threshold and in the shape parameters of the survivorship function and least sensitive to a 10% variation in the shape parameters of the development function and the survivorship level. Recommendations are made to take into account other factors than temperature and plant phenology and include a wider geographical area in further model development.

J	Johansen, TJ; Meadow, R				Johansen, Tor J.; Meadow, Richard			Diapause development in early and late emerging phenotypes of Delia floralis	INSECT SCIENCE												The turnip fly, Delia floralis Fallen (Diptera: Anthomyiidae) is an important insect pest of brassica vegetable crops in the holarctic region. Different populations have strongly varying temperature requirements for fly emergence, a challenge for accurate prediction of activity. This study focused on diapause development in one early and one late emerging phenotype. The physiological state after various treatments was deduced from emergence data. Our results showed a slow diapause progression at chilling conditions for both populations and diapause ended about 7 months after pupae were formed for the early population. For the late population held at 4 degrees C diapause did not end, no matter how long the duration of chilling. These pupae required a period with elevated temperatures above 6 degrees C to continue development. At constant non-chilling conditions (18 degrees C) from the time pupae were formed both populations completed diapause most rapidly. These results indicate that chilling delayed, rather than accelerated development and was not a prerequisite for diapause development. For post-diapause, results indicated a linear relationship between rate of development and temperature within the range of 6-18 degrees C and a theoretical base temperature for development of about 2 degrees C for both populations. In conclusion, D. floralis pupae are in diapause throughout a long winter period, and delayed emergence of the late population appears to be caused by prolonged diapause regulated by a developmental temperature threshold. The study has added information on the biology of turnip fly populations, a prerequisite for improved pest control.																	1672-9609	1744-7917				FEB	2014	21	1					103	113		10.1111/1744-7917.12013								WOS:000330626700012	23956069

The Proportion of Light-Responsive Neurons Determines the Limit Cycle Properties of the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL RHYTHMS												In mammals, the central clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) controls physiological and behavioral circadian rhythms and is entrained to the external light-dark cycle. The ability of the SCN to entrain can be measured by exposing the animal to a light-dark cycle with a duration that deviates from 24 h (T-cycles); a wider entrainment range reflects a higher ability to entrain. The neurons of the SCN are either light responsive or light unresponsive and are mutually synchronized. The coupling and synchronization between individual SCN neurons and between groups of neurons within the SCN influence the SCN's ability to entrain. Some studies suggest that enhanced coupling decreases the entrainment range, whereas others suggest that enhanced coupling increases the entrainment range. The latter results are surprising, as they are not consistent with the prevalent assumption that the SCN is a limit cycle oscillator that has larger phase shifts when the amplitude is smaller. Here, we used the Poincare and Goodwin models to test entrainment properties using various proportions of neurons that are responsive to an external stimulus. If all neurons receive external input, the SCN shows limit cycle behavior in all conditions. If all neurons do not receive light input, we found that the entrainment range of the SCN was positively related to coupling strength when coupling was weak. When coupling strength was stronger and above a critical value, the entrainment range was negatively correlated with coupling strength. The results obtained from our simulations were confirmed by analytical studies. Thus, the limit cycle behavior of the SCN appears to be critically dependent on the coupling strength among the neurons and the proportion of neurons that respond to the entraining stimulus.																	0748-7304	1552-4531				FEB	2014	29	1					16	27		10.1177/0748730413516752								WOS:000330559700003	24492879

Development characteristics of the box-tree moth Cydalima perspectalis and its potential distribution in Europe	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY												The box-tree moth Cydalima perspectalis (Walker) is an invasive pest causing severe damage to box trees (Buxus spp.). It is native to Japan, Korea and China, but established populations have been recorded in a number of locations across Europe since 2007 and the spread of the insect continues. The developmental investigations suggest that larvae overwinter mainly in their 3rd instar in Europe and that diapause is induced by a day length of about 13.5h. One and a half to 2months in the cold are necessary to terminate diapause. Threshold temperatures for development and number of degree-days to complete a generation are slightly different from those calculated in previous studies in Japan. A bioclimatic (CLIMEX (R)) model for C.perspectalis in Europe was developed, based on climate, ecological and developmental parameters from the literature and new field and laboratory studies on diapause termination, thermal requirements and phenology. The model was then validated with actual distribution records and phenology data. The current distribution and life history of C.perspectalis in Europe were consistent with the predicted distribution. The climate model suggests that C.perspectalis is likely to continue its spread across Europe, except for Northern Fenno-Scandinavia, Northern Scotland and high mountain regions. The northern distribution of C.perspectalis is expected to be limited by a number of degree-days above the temperature threshold insufficient to complete a generation, whereas its southern range is limited by the absence of a cold period necessary to resume diapause. The model predicts relatively high Ecoclimatic Indices throughout most of Europe, suggesting that the insect has the potential of becoming a pest in most of its predicted range. However, damage is likely to be higher in Southern and Central Europe where the moth is able to complete at least two generations per year.																	0931-2048	1439-0418				FEB	2014	138	1-2					14	26		10.1111/jen.12078								WOS:000329530100003

Geographic variation in thermal and photoperiodic effects on development of zoophytophagous plant bug Nesidiocoris tenuis	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY												The zoophytophagous plant bug Nesidiocoris tenuis (Reuter) is increasingly used for biological control of various agricultural pests. Its native range includes Southern Europe, North Africa, Southern and South-Eastern Asia, although only the Mediterranean strains have been studied experimentally. We investigated effects of temperature and photoperiod on nymphal survival and development, rate of female maturation and egg load in two strains of N.tenuis originating from temperate and subtropical regions of South-Eastern Asia: the Temperate strain' (from Suwon, Republic of Korea, yearly average air temperature is 13.3 degrees C) and the Subtropical strain' (from Miyazaki, Japan, yearly average air temperature is 18.2 degrees C). Nymphs and adults were reared on tomato leaflets and fed with eggs of the grain moth Sitotroga cerealella under four temperatures (15, 20, 25 and 30 degrees C) and three photoperiods (10, 12 and 14h of light per day). In spite of long-term (40-50 generations) rearing under constant laboratory conditions, the studied strains still show a correlation between thermotolerance indices and climate at origin. In particular, at the low temperature of 15 degrees C, survival of nymphs of the Temperate strain was double that of the Subtropical strain, whereas at the higher tested temperatures, survival of the Subtropical strain was not significantly different or even was higher than that of the Temperate strain. The duration of nymphal development in the Temperate strain was significantly shorter than that in the Subtropical strain at 15-25 degrees C, but not at 30 degrees C. In both strains, nymphal survival, duration of nymphal development and rate of female maturation were not significantly dependent on photoperiod, and diapause was not observed under any conditions tested. We conclude that the Subtropical strain of N.tenuis is better adapted to high temperatures, whereas the Temperate strain is more promising for application in greenhouses at medium and low temperatures.

J	Montero-Pau, J; Gabaldon, C; Carmona, MJ; Serra, M				Montero-Pau, Javier; Gabaldon, Carmen; Jose Carmona, Maria; Serra, Manuel			Measuring the potential for growth in populations investing in diapause	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												The intrinsic rate of population increase (r) is a common performance measure in many ecological and evolutionary studies. However, in life cycles with diapause investment resources are split into a short-term (current population growth) and a long-term (population survival through periods of unsuitable habitat conditions) component, which complicates the use of r as a single performance measure. Here we propose a new measure that integrates both performance components into a single parameter, the potential intrinsic growth rate, r(pot). This is the rate of increase that a population/genotype would have if no investment in diapausing stages would occur. We show that rpot can be computed using standard demographic data from temporal series or life table experiments and demonstrate the use of the r(pot) for two common life cycles among zooplanktonic organisms: (1) a cyclically parthenogenetic life cycle where investment in diapause happens only during the sexual phase, and (2) an obligate sexual life cycle with a switch from non-investing females to investing females along the lifespan. Using case studies we show that choosing r(pot) or the standard r affects comparisons between genotypes/populations or environmental factors. We provide clues on how r(pot) can be estimated in other life cycles with diapause investment if appropriate assumptions are made. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Zhao, W; Liu, NF				Zhao, Wei; Liu, Nai-fa			The Proximate Causes of Sexual Size Dimorphism in Phrynocephalus przewalskii	PLOS ONE												Sexual size dimorphism (SSD) is a common phenomenon and is a central topic in evolutionary biology. Recently, the importance of pursuing an ontogenetic perspective of SSD has been emphasized, to elucidate the proximate physiological mechanisms leading to its evolution. However, such research has seldom focused on the critical periods when males and females diverge. Using mark-recapture data, we investigated the development of SSD, sex-specific survivorship, and growth rates in Phrynocephalus przewalskii (Agamidae). We demonstrated that both male and female lizards are reproductively mature at age 10-11 months (including 5 months hibernation). Male-biased SSD in snout-vent length (SVL) was only found in adults and was fully expressed at age 11 months (June of the first full season of activity), just after sexual maturation. However, male-biased SSD in tail length (TL), hind-limb length (LL), and head width (HW) were fully expressed at age 9-10 months, just before sexual maturation. Analysis of age-specific linear growth rates identified sexually dimorphic growth during the fifth growth month (age 10-11 months) as the proximate cause of SSD in SVL. The males experienced higher mortality than females in the first 2 years and only survived better than females after SSD was well developed. This suggests that the critical period of divergence in the sizes of male and female P. przewalskii occurs between 10 and 11 months of age (May to June during the first full season of activity), and that the sexual difference in growth during this period is the proximate cause. However, the sexual difference in survivorship cannot explain the male-biased SSD in SVL. Our results indicate that performance-related characteristics, such as TL, HW, and LL diverged earlier than SVL. The physiological mechanisms underlying the different growth patterns of males and females may reflect different energy allocations associated with their different reproductive statuses.																	1932-6203					JAN 21	2014	9	1							e85963	10.1371/journal.pone.0085963								WOS:000330244500156	24465815

In humans, disruption of circadian rhythms is commonly observed in psychiatric diseases, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression and autism. Light therapy is the most effective treatment for seasonal affective disorder and circadian-related treatments sustain antidepressant response in bipolar disorder patients. Day/night cycles represent a major circadian synchronizing signal and vary widely with latitude. Results: We apply a geographically explicit model to show that out-of-Africa migration, which led humans to occupy a wide latitudinal area, affected the evolutionary history of circadian regulatory genes. The SNPs we identify using this model display consistent signals of natural selection using tests based on population genetic differentiation and haplotype homozygosity. Signals of natural selection driven by annual photoperiod variation are detected for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and restless leg syndrome risk variants, in line with the circadian component of these conditions. Conclusions: Our results suggest that human populations adapted to life at different latitudes by tuning their circadian clock systems. This process also involves risk variants for neuropsychiatric conditions, suggesting possible genetic modulators for chronotherapies and candidates for interaction analysis with photoperiod-related environmental variables, such as season of birth, country of residence, shift-work or lifestyle habits.

However, few studies have recorded the biological characteristics and effects of temperature on the development of this natural predator. We observed the biological characteristics and the effect of temperature on the development of immature and adult H. fuscipes predators at 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 degrees C with 60% relative humidity and a 16:8 L:D photoperiod on a diet of S. litura larvae. The results revealed two generations of H. fuscipes in Nanxiong Guangdong, including egg, 5 instars nymphal and adult, H. fuscipes live through the winter as adults. The optimum temperature for the development and reproduction of H. fuscipes was around 30 degrees C. Temperatures in the range of 15-35 degrees C had no effect on oviposition period, but the adults could not lay eggs normally at 15 degrees C. Our findings indicate that the biological traits and the differences in development and reproduction of H. fuscipes at different temperatures could be of importance for its mass rearing and use in the biological control of M. persicae, H. assulta and S. litura in tobacco fields.																	1302-0250						2014	16		2				61	69										WOS:000341280700007

The plants tested (18 species and varieties of Sorghum, 16 forage grasses, 6 Miscanthus genotypes, 6 Panicum varieties and 3 broadleaf species) were grown for at least three weeks before they were used in the bioassays. The insects used in the experiments were obtained from a non diapausing laboratory strain originally from the US and maintained by BTL since 2006. Only neonate larvae (not older than 24 hours) were used in the bioassays. In each experiment up to six species or varieties of plants were tested each with 10 replicates (containers). A susceptible maize variety was used as a positive control in each experiment. Each plant container was infested with ten neonate WCR larvae using a fine art brush. After inoculation the plants were not watered for at least 24 hours to facilitate the establishment of the larvae. The experiments were terminated after 18 days. To extract surviving larvae the soil and roots of test plants were carefully examined by hand and then transferred to a modified MacFadyen heat extractor with an extraction temperature of 45 degrees C. To assess the host quality the number of larvae recovered, the widths of their head capsules and dry weights were recorded. The larvae were dried at 40 degrees C for at least 72 hours and then weighed on an electronic micro balance Of the 21 forage and switch grasses examined 16 hosted WCR larvae. However, the percentage of larvae that survived for 18 days, their dry weights and head capsule widths were significantly less than that recorded for larvae that developed on maize roots. The roots of most (i.e. 15) of the 18 Sorghum species or varieties tested were unsuitable for the development of WCR larvae. For the remaining three Sorghum species a maximum of only two larvae (of 100 inoculated) were recovered.These results indicate that species of Sorghum are very poor quality hosts for WCR as previously reported in other studies. The opposite was true for the Miscanthus species tested. The number of larvae recovered from Miscanthus x giganteus roots, their dry weight and head capsule widths were the same as those recorded for larvae reared on the maize control.The other Miscanthus genotypes were less suitable than Mxg, but still more acceptable than all the forage and switch grasses tested in this study. In accordance with all previous studies, which used host plants other than maize, no larvae developed on the three broad leaf species.																	1868-9892		978-3-95547-003-6				2014	444						134	+		10.5073/jka.2014.444.041								WOS:000340685900042

To clarify the effect of photoperiod on induction of reproductive diapause in this species and its geographic variation, females from Iwate (39.5 degrees N), Kyoto (35.5 degrees N), and Kagoshima (31.5 degrees N) populations were reared under six different photoperiodic conditions at 20 degrees C. Females reared under a long-day condition (16L8D) initiated oviposition within 15 days after adult emergence, while those reared under short-day conditions entered reproductive diapause. The critical day-length for induction of the diapause was about 15 hours in the Iwate population, between 14 and 15 hours in the Kyoto population, and between 12 and 13 hours in Kagoshima population. Although the maximum percentage of diapausing females below the critical day-length was more than 90% in Iwate and Kyoto populations, it was less than 50% in the Kagoshima population. Variation in photoperiodic response curves for diapause induction among several bloods within the Kagoshima population was larger than that in Iwate and Kyoto populations. Moreover, mean pre-oviposition period of females entering diapause in the Kagoshima population was shorter than that in Iwate and Kyoto populations. The critical day-lengths for diapause induction in reciprocal crosses between Kyoto and Kagoshima populations were between 13 and 14 hours, and the incidence of diapause in the crosses was higher than that of the Kagoshima population under a short-day length (<14L)																	0021-4914	1347-6068					2014	58	1					47	54		10.1303/jjaez.2014.47								WOS:000339456600011

Individual-based modelling of Calanus sinicus population dynamics in the Yellow Sea	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Calanus sinicus is the dominant copepod species in the coastal waters of China. We studied its population dynamics using an individual-based model (IBM) based on physiological processes at the individual level. The model includes modules describing development, growth, reproduction, mortality, diel vertical migration and diapause. Development, growth and reproduction are affected mainly by temperature and food concentration. Mortality includes routine mortality of stage plus density-dependent mortality, and weight-dependent mortality for N1-C6 stages. Control of seasonal diapause is based on lipid accumulation and lipid metabolism. The model was applied in a 1-dimensional water column located in the central Yellow Sea, and simulations showed that the population of C. sinicus peaks twice in 1 yr, with the earlier peak depending strongly on the phytoplankton bloom in spring, and the later (December) peak relying on lipid-stored energy from the over-summering population dominated by diapausing C5s. The model population of C. sinicus goes through 3 generations in 1 yr, and the over-summering population of diapausing C5s consists of both first (G1) and second (G2) generation individuals. Coupled with more extensive field observations of abundance and biomass of C. sinicus, an IBM can be forced using output from an integrated hydrodynamic-nutrient-phytoplankton model to examine the processes responsible for the spatial-temporal variation of C. sinicus throughout its range in the Yellow Sea.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2014	503						75	97		10.3354/meps10725								WOS:000335581700006

For further progress, a deeper study on the physiological mechanisms is needed that confer the unexpected levels of resistance detected on these symbiotic organisms. In this work, the response of the lichenized green algae Trebouxia sp. (a predominant lichen photobiont) to increasing doses of UV-C radiation is studied. UV-C (one of the most lethal factors to be found in space together with vacuum and cosmic-ionizing radiation with high atomic number and energy (HZE) particles) has been applied in the present experiments up to a maximum dose analogue to 67 days in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). For that purpose we selected two extremotolerant and space-tested lichen species in which Trebouxia sp. is the photosynthetic partner: the crustose lichen Rhizocarpon geographicum and the fruticose lichen Circinaria gyrosa. In order to evaluate the effect of the physiological state of the lichen thallus (active when wet and dormant when dry) and of protective structures (cortex and photoprotective pigments) on the resistance of the photobiont to UV-C, four different experimental conditions were tested: (1) dry intact samples, (2) wet intact samples, (3) dry samples without cortex/acetone-rinsed and (4) wet samples without cortex/acetone-rinsed. After irradiation and a 72 hours period of recovery, the influence of UV-C on the two lichen's photobiont under each experimental approach was assessed by two complimentary methods: (1) By determining the photosystem II (PSII) activity in three successive 24 hours intervals (Mini-PAM fluorometer) to investigate the overall state of the photosynthetic process and the resilience of Trebouxia sp. (2) By performing high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-quantification of four essential photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, beta-carotene and lutein) of one sample of each species and dose. Results indicate that the physiological state of the thallus is the most important factor impairing the tolerance of Trebouxia sp. to UV-C radiation in both lichen species. Desiccated thalli were demonstrated to be more resistant to UV-C. No clear influence of UV-C radiation on the carotenoid content was detected. Comparing the respective doses applied, the individuals of R. geographicum are more sensitive than C. gyrosa.

Mosquito Diapause	ANNUAL REVIEW OF ENTOMOLOGY, VOL 59, 2014	Annual Review of Entomology											Diapause, a dominant feature in the life history of many mosquito species, offers a mechanism for bridging unfavorable seasons in both temperate and tropical environments and serves to synchronize development within populations, thus directly affecting disease transmission cycles. The trait appears to have evolved independently numerous times within the Culicidae, as exemplified by the diverse developmental stages of diapause in closely related species. Its impact is pervasive, not only influencing the arrested stage, but also frequently altering physiological processes both before and after diapause. How the diapause response can be molded evolutionarily is critical for understanding potential range expansions of native and newly introduced species. The study of hormonal regulation of mosquito diapause has focused primarily on adult diapause, with little current information available on larval diapause or the intriguing maternal effects that regulate egg diapause. Recent quantitative trait locus, transcriptome, and RNA interference studies hold promise for interpreting the complex suite of genes that subserve the diapause phenotype.																	0066-4170		978-0-8243-0159-0				2014	59						73	U691		10.1146/annurev-ento-011613-162023								WOS:000329608900006	24160427					
J	Telleria, JL; Carrascal, LM; Santos, T				Telleria, Jose L.; Carrascal, Luis M.; Santos, Tomas			Large-scale features affect spatial variation in seed dispersal by birds in juniper woodlands	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH												Fruit-frugivore interactions have received great attention from evolutionary, ecological and applied perspectives. However, despite the fact that large-scale approaches may offer new insights on fruit-frugivore interactions, little work has been devoted to exploring the factors shaping large-scale variation of seed dispersal. This paper studies the spatial variation in seeds regurgitated within pellets by wintering thrushes (genusTurdus) in a set of 26 Spanish juniper (Juniperus thurifera) woodlands scattered along a latitudinal gradient during two winters of contrasting cone and bird abundance. It explicitly explores whether pellet rain variation among woodlands was related to changes in vegetation cover, temperature, day length duration and bird abundance. Top regression models in the Akaike information criterion framework explained 34 % and 70 % of variance in pellet numbers in low and high crop and bird abundance years, respectively. In both winters, the spatial variation in pellets correlated to thrush abundance and day length duration. Pellet abundance linked to cone distribution only in the year of high crop, in which many migratory, extra-Iberian thrushes arrived to exploit the resource. Strong dependence of seed dispersion on large-scale features affecting bird numbers (e.g. the arrival of extra-Iberian migratory birds) and feeding behaviour (e.g. latitudinal variation in day length duration) suggests a primary role for variables acting at large scale on this mutualistic interaction.

Musca autumnalis (Diptera: Muscidae) and the Host-Specific Nematode Paraiotonchium autumnale (Tylenchida: Iotonchiidae) in Southern California	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY												Musca autumnalis DeGeer were collected in the summer and fall of 2011 and 2012 from a beef cattle herd in southern California. Visual counts of Musca spp. on cattle faces were documented, and sweep net samples of face flies and other Diptera were also collected from cattle faces. Face flies dominated in the net collections, and 5 30 flies per face were common between early July and October 2011. Adult female M. autumnalis were dissected and examined for the presence of the host-specific nematode Paraiotonchium autumnale (Nickle). Overall, 67 of 887 (7.6%) adult face fly females were parasitized. M. autumnalis' ability to survive in such a southerly latitude (34 degrees N) could reflect the rather temperate weather (coastal effects) and frequently irrigated pastures at the experimental site in southern California. Preliminary observations suggest that face flies disappear from cattle during winter, despite generally favorable temperatures for fly activity. This is a possible indication of diapause and should be examined further.																	0022-2585	1938-2928				JAN	2014	51	1					288	292		10.1603/ME13127								WOS:000329804600034	24605481					
J	Walczynska, A; Serra, M				Walczynska, Aleksandra; Serra, Manuel			Species size affects hatching response to different temperature regimes in a rotifer cryptic species complex	EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY												The strategy of decreasing size with increasing temperature known as Bergmann's rule operates at geographic scale and in spite of extensive studies still presents a puzzle to researches. The aim of this work was to verify whether patterns of diapausing egg hatching of closely related species are consistent with the expectations from Bergmann's rule. In a laboratory study of the cryptic species complex of the rotifer Brachionus plicatilis, the response to temperature (17.5, 22.5, and 25.0 A degrees C) of diapausing eggs collected in a pond where the three tested species coexist was assessed by (1) the number of hatchlings emerging or (2) the time needed to hatch. Our results show that the response to temperature from the sediment egg bank is species-dependent. In line with Bergmann's rule, an association was observed between the hatching response to temperature and organism size. The biggest species increased its proportion in the hatchlings as temperature decreased, and vice versa. The intermediate size species showed an intermediate pattern. Nevertheless, temperature showed a general positive effect on hatching success. Time needed to hatch suggests a signature of Bergmann's rule, but other factors seem to be affecting this parameter. This is the first study to demonstrate differences in the thermal dependence of diapausing egg hatching among closely related species with different body sizes, and it supports that Bergmann's rule can be applied to diapause, an important phase in many invertebrate lifecycles.

Diapause termination of Rhagoletis cerasi pupae is regulated by local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity: escape in time through bet-hedging strategies	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY												Persistence and thriving of univoltine, herbivore insect species of the temperate zone rely on obligate diapause response that ensures winter survival and synchronization with host phenology. We used a stenophagous fruit fly (Rhagoletis cerasi) with obligate pupae diapause to determine genetic and environmental effects on diapause intensity of geographically isolated populations with habitat heterogeneity. Pupae from two Greek and one German populations with various gene flow rates were exposed at five constant chilling temperatures (0-12 degrees C) for different durations and then incubated at a high temperature until all adults have emerged. Pupae diapause intensity differs among Greek and German populations, suggesting an adaptive response to habitat heterogeneity (mostly differences in phenology patterns of local host cultivars). Moderately warm winter temperatures, such as 8 degrees C, promote diapause termination in all three populations. Insufficient chilling (short duration or warmer temperatures) regulates the expression of prolonged dormancy. Interestingly, extended chilling (longer than required for terminating diapause) return' pupae to another (facultative) cycle of dormancy enabling adults to emerge during the next appropriate window of time'; a strategy first time reported for univoltine insects. Consequently, diapause duration of R.cerasi is determined both by i) the adaptive response to local climatic conditions (annual dormancy) and ii) the plastic responses to interannual climatic variability resulting in two types of long life cycles within populations, prolonged and facultative dormancy as response to insufficient chilling and extended exposure to chilling, respectively. Long life cycles are expressed as a part of dormancy bet-hedging strategies of R.cerasi populations.

We studied the nest types and nesting site selection of radio tagged hedgehogs in urban areas in Eastern Finland. Altogether, four different nest types were discovered and one of them (the pre-hibernation nest) is described here for the first time. Hedgehogs preferred residential areas for nesting during the mating and post-mating seasons while in the pre-hibernation season and hibernation period nesting was more common in forest areas. Nest constructions were closely related to materials found in the nest vicinity. During the active period, males used on average 24 nests and changed them 30 times, whereas females used 17 nests and changed them 26 times. The number of female nests and frequency of nest change increased from post-mating to pre-hibernation seasons, while in males both decreased. In general, female and male nests were situated within their established long-term home range, but in the pre-hibernation season over 30 % of male nests were situated outside of it. In post-mating and pre-hibernation seasons, females avoided other individuals of the same sex; this was demonstrated by the lack of nests in other female core areas. Hedgehogs hibernate for around 223 days, which is the longest reported hibernation period for this species. The results of the present study emphasise the importance of forest and diverse residential areas including forest patches for the hedgehog's nesting habitat.																	0001-7051	2190-3743				JAN	2014	59	1					173	181		10.1007/s13364-013-0150-0								WOS:000329095800015

Phenology predicts the native and invasive range limits of common ragweed	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Accurate models for species' distributions are needed to forecast the progress and impacts of alien invasive species and assess potential range-shifting driven by global change. Although this has traditionally been achieved through data-driven correlative modelling, robustly extrapolating these models into novel climatic conditions is challenging. Recently, a small number of process-based or mechanistic distribution models have been developed to complement the correlative approaches. However, tests of these models are lacking, and there are very few process-based models for invasive species. We develop a method for estimating the range of a globally invasive species, common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.), from a temperature- and photoperiod-driven phenology model. The model predicts the region in which ragweed can reach reproductive maturity before frost kills the adult plants in autumn. This aligns well with the poleward and high-elevation range limits in its native North America and in invaded Europe, clearly showing that phenological constraints determine the cold range margins of the species. Importantly, this is a forward' prediction made entirely independently of the distribution data. Therefore, it allows a confident and biologically informed forecasting of further invasion and range shifting driven by climate change. For ragweed, such forecasts are extremely important as the species is a serious crop weed and its airborne pollen is a major cause of allergy and asthma in humans. Our results show that phenology can be a key determinant of species' range margins, so integrating phenology into species distribution models offers great potential for the mechanistic modelling of range dynamics.

By contrast to E. tuberis, a well studied species, no information exists on the biology, behavior, host-range and population dynamics of E. similaris to base adequate and efficient control strategies. Because of the subterranean development of the larvae, the small size and high mobility of the adults, the field studies necessary to collect data on the population dynamics and damage, for determining the most adequate timing and control strategies are difficult to carry-out with natural populations. To circumvent this constraint we developed at INIAV a rearing technique for producing adult insects of the species E. similaris for the artificial infestation of laboratory and field experiments. The insects are reared inside cages kept in a walk-in climate-controlled chamber (temperature 22 +/- 0.5 degrees C, 16h day-length, and 64%-84% relative humidity). As host-plants, juvenile potted plants of aubergine (Solanum melongena L.) and small potted plants of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) are used. The host plants are produced in a separate chamber, and later introduced in the insect rearing unit to be exposed to adult insects during three weeks, for oviposition to occur. After this period, the plants are cleaned off from adults, removed from the oviposition cage and transferred to smaller emergence cages, where the immature stages present in the soil are allowed to complete their development. Each pot is kept 5-7 weeks in the emergence cage. The adults are daily collected with entomological mouth aspirators, and either used for the experiments or reintroduced into the production cycle. The cultures are refreshed twice per year with insects collected from the field, in order to preserve a large genetic base in the insect cultures.																			978-84-695-9055-3				2014							1849	1854										WOS:000376620800315						
J	Tachiki, Y; Iwasa, Y				Tachiki, Yuuya; Iwasa, Yoh			Coevolution of mast seeding in trees and extended diapause of seed predators	JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY												Many trees in forests show synchronized and intermittent reproduction, which is called "masting" or mast seeding. According to recent theoretical studies, the evolution of masting is promoted both by recruitment through the seedling bank and by seed predators. An important class of specialist seed predators (e.g., weevils and some moths) are parasitoids that oviposit on or in fruits from which the next generation emerges over the following several years. This staggered emergence is called "extended diapause". In this paper, we study the simultaneous evolution of tree masting and extended diapause of seed predators. If a fixed fraction of diapausing larvae matures every year, the evolution of trees results in masting (intermittent reproduction with a large fluctuation in reproductive activity) or non-masting (trees reproduce every year). The transition occurs discontinuously, showing evolutionary jumping. The range of seedling survivorship for which masting evolves is broader when the ovipositing efficiency and larval survivorship of the seed predators are large. Interestingly, the conditions for the evolution of masting are broadest for an intermediate fraction of extended diapause of seed predators. When both tree masting and the extended diapause of seed predators evolve simultaneously, the evolutionary end point of the fraction of extended diapause is clearly greater than the value that most favors masting evolution. The stochasticity caused by the finiteness of the number of trees tends to promote masting evolution. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Distribution, host plant affiliation, phenology, and phylogeny of walnut-infesting Rhagoletis flies (Diptera: Tephritidae) in Mexico	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY												Many taxa of Nearctic origin have diversified in the subtropical highlands of Mexico. In particular, flies in the genus Rhagoletis have undergone episodes of isolation and gene flow during Pleistocene glaciations and post-glacial times that have produced lineage differentiation and reproductive isolation. To reach a better understanding of the phylogeography of the genus Rhagoletis, a host plant survey of the walnut-infesting Rhagoletis suavis species group was conducted across sixteen states comprising 34 different collecting sites in Mexico over a 9-year period. Five species of Juglans were found to be infested by three species of walnut-attacking Rhagoletis flies. Several species of parasitoids were also recovered from collections, but in contrast to their walnut fly hosts, they revealed little evidence for host or geographic subdivision. There was no consistent difference in mean eclosion time between walnut fly species or populations associated with different host walnuts in Mexico, unlike the case for other Rhagoletis species, in which allochronic isolation arising from variation in diapause timing is a major ecological adaptation, reproductively isolating flies. We compare the distribution of R.suavis flies in Mexico with those of other Rhagoletis species attacking hawthorns and cherries, and discuss its implications for population divergence and speciation.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London.																	0024-4066	1095-8312				DEC	2013	110	4					765	779		10.1111/bij.12157								WOS:000330183200005

Heat stress and the fitness consequences of climate change for terrestrial ectotherms	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												1. Climate change will increase both average temperatures and extreme summer temperatures. Analyses of the fitness consequences of climate change have generally omitted negative fitness and population declines associated with heat stress. 2. Here, we examine how seasonal and interannual temperature variability will impact fitness shifts of ectotherms from the past (1961-1990) to future (2071-2100), by modelling thermal performance curves (TPCs) for insect species across latitudes. 3. In temperate regions, climate change increased the length of the growing season (increasing fitness) and increased the frequency of heat stress (decreasing fitness). Consequently, species at mid-latitudes (20-40 degrees) showed pronounced but heterogeneous responses to climate change. Fitness decreases for these species were accompanied by greater interannual variation in fitness. An alternative TPC model and a larger data set gave qualitatively similar results. 4. How close maximum summer temperatures are to the critical thermal maximum of a species - the thermal buffer - is a good predictor of the change in mean fitness expected under climate change. Thermal buffers will decrease to near or below zero by 2100 for many tropical and mid-latitude species. 5. Our forecasts suggest that mid-latitude species will be particularly susceptible to heat stress associated with climate change due to temperature variation.

Health Status of Alfalfa Leafcutting Bee Larvae (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) in United States Alfalfa Seed Fields	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												We conducted a broad geographic survey in the northwestern United States to quantify production losses in the alfalfa leafcutting bee (Megachile rotundata (F.), Hymenoptera: Megachilidae), a solitary pollinator used extensively in alfalfa seed production. Viable larvae were found in only 47.1% of the nest cells collected at the end of the season. Most of the rest of the cells contained pollen balls (typified by a provision but no larva; 16.7%), unknown causes of mortality (15.5%), or larvae killed by chalkbrood (8.0%). Prevalence of pollen balls was correlated positively with bee release rates and negatively with alfalfa stand age. The unknown mortality was correlated with the U. S. Department of Agriculture-Plant Hardiness Zone, and thus, some of the mortality may be caused by high temperature extremes, although the nesting season degree-days were not correlated with this mortality. Chalk-brood prevalence was correlated with possible nesting-resource or crowding-related factors, such as the number of bees released per hectare and the number of shelters used, but not with nesting board disinfection practices. Vapona is used to control parasitoids when the parent bees are incubated before release, and use of this fumigant was associated with an increase in both chalkbrood and diapausing offspring, although any reason for these correlations are unknown. This survey quantifies the variation in the quality of alfalfa leafcutting bee cocoons produced across much of the U. S. alfalfa seed production area.																	0046-225X	1938-2936				DEC	2013	42	6					1166	1173		10.1603/EN13041								WOS:000329990000005	24128927

SUPERCOOLING IN THE REDBAY AMBROSIA BEETLE (COLEOPTERA: CURCULIONIDAE)	FLORIDA ENTOMOLOGIST												The redbay ambrosia beetle, Xyleborus glabratus Eichoff, (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae) is a severe pest of North American trees and shrubs in the family Lauraceae. Supercooling point (SCP) is an important physiological baseline for cold tolerance studies and could provide useful insights into the invasive potential of X. glabratus in northern latitudes of North America. The supercooling point (SCP) of X. glabratus was experimentally determined on field-collected and artificially cold hardened specimens. Field-collected beetles were captured in Jackson County, Mississippi using Lindgren funnel traps baited with manuka oil lures. Testing was conducted from June through August 2011. The mean SOP for field-collected X. glabratus was -21.7 +/- 0.5 degrees C (+/- SE). A significant negative trend in the SCPs of field-collected beetles occurred over the summer testing period. Xyleborus glabratus specimens were reared from redbay (Persea borbonia (L.) Sprengel bolts in June 2012 and artificially cold hardened in a low temperature incubator at a thermo-photoperiod of 7 degrees C:2 degrees C (10:14 h L:D) for 31 days. Artificially cold hardened X. glabratus supercooled to a mean temperature of -23.9 +/- 0.4 degrees C (+/- SE), which was significantly lower than that of field-collected beetles. Biometric indices of beetles (size, weight, and size x weight interaction) had no effect on the mean supercooling SCPs of either field-collected or artificially cold hardened beetles. Results from environmentally conditioned beetles suggest that X. glabratus has a high degree of thermal plasticity. Based on the artificially cold hardened mean SOP, X. glabratus and laurel wilt disease have the possibility to impact sassafras and northern spicebush throughout eastern North America. The data, although preliminary, suggests that a previous spatio-temporal model based on climate match data may have substantially underestimated the geographical area that may be affected by X. glabratus. This study will help form the basis of building and validating models to better predict the North American invasion potential of X. glabratus.

J	Zoller, H; Drygala, F				Zoller, Hinrich; Drygala, Frank			Activity patterns of the invasive raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides) in North East Germany	FOLIA ZOOLOGICA												To study annual and circadian activity proportion and activity allocation during the pup rearing period we analysed VHF telemetry-based data from the invasive, socially monogamous raccoon dog in North Eastern Germany. Proportions of active fixes for 26 adults indicate a mean annual activity level of 58.3 %. There was no difference between males and females in mean annual activity or in the mean activity in each of the different seasons. A mean winter-activity level of 47.0 % +/- 32.4 active fixes indicates that raccoon dogs did not hibernate; however, they became less active as the temperature decreases in winter. There were clear differences in the proportion of active fixes observed in the biological seasons, with the highest activity level (70.3 %) during the pup rearing period. Circadian activity rhythm, sampled on a daily basis, indicates that raccoon dogs were mainly crepuscular and nocturnal with a mean activity level of 86.8 %. The mean diurnal activity level across the seasons was 32.4 %, ranging from 15.0 % in winter to 56.6 % during the pup rearing period. Allocation of active fixes for 24-h continuous observations during the first six weeks after parturition showed that males were mostly inactive, resting with the pups in the den, while females foraged to satisfy their increased energy requirements. This point to a clear division of labour between parents, during the pup rearing period.																	0139-7893	1573-1189				DEC	2013	62	4					290	296										WOS:000328874000006						
J	Glippa, O; Alekseev, VR; Souissi, S				Glippa, Olivier; Alekseev, Victor R.; Souissi, Sami			Effects of photoperiod on egg production in Eurytemora affinis Poppe, 1880 (Copepoda: Calanoida) from the Seine Estuary (France)	ITALIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												The calanoid copepod Eurytemora affinis Poppe, 1880 is the most abundant species of the mesozooplanktonic community of the Seine estuary (France) in the lower salinity zone. Diapausing eggs of this species have been found in the sediment of this estuary but they are few in comparison with those found for other calanoid species. We thus decided to test the effect of photoperiod on diapausing egg production in E. affinis from the Seine estuary. For this, an experimental device has been developed. A combination of five photoperiods and two temperatures was used and the production of eggs was studied for the first and the second clutch. The production of diapausing eggs was demonstrated under photoperiodic conditions less than or equal to 12h of light either at 12 or 16 degrees C with a maximum under constant darkness (6%). A significant increase in the number of non-viable eggs was also observed between the first and the second clutch for all tested conditions and this may be due to the non-fertilization of these eggs. We also verified that the late naupliar instars are sensitive to the photoperiodic signal.The experimental approach has revealed that the production of diapausing eggs in the key species to the downstream Seine estuary, E. affinis, could be induced by short days, but photoperiod was probably not the only factor responsible for the induction of diapausing egg production. The percentage of diapausing eggs obtained under the induction experiment is similar to that obtained from the eggs extracted from the sediment of the Seine estuary (7%). The strategy of E. affinis in this estuary would be to constitute an egg bank, acting as long-term survival or in the case of adverse conditions. The role of geographical position (mainly latitude) and local conditions in the reproductive strategy of E. affinis is discussed.

J	Woller, A; Gonze, D				Woller, Aurore; Gonze, Didier			The Bird Circadian Clock: Insights from a Computational Model	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL RHYTHMS												The circadian timekeeping system appears more complex in birds than in mammals. In mammals, the main pacemaker is centralized in the suprachiasmatic nuclei, whereas in birds, the pacemaker involves the interplay between the pineal and hypothalamic oscillators. In order to investigate the consequence of this complex mechanism, we propose here a mathematical model for the bird circadian clock. The model is based on the internal resonance between the pineal and hypothalamic oscillators, each described by Goodwin-like equations. We show that, consistently with experimental observations, self-sustained oscillations can be generated by mutual inhibitory coupling of the 2 clocks, even if individual oscillators present damped oscillations. We study the effect of constant and periodic administrations of melatonin, which, in intact birds, acts as the coupling variable between the pineal and the hypothalamus, and compare the prediction of the model with the experiments performed in pinealectomized birds. We also assess the entrainment properties when the system is subject to light-dark cycles. Analyses of the entrainment range, resynchronization time after jet lag, and entrainment phase with respect to the photoperiod lead us to formulate hypotheses about the physiological advantage of the particular architecture of the avian circadian clock. Although minimal, our model opens promising perspectives in modeling and understanding the bird circadian clock.																	0748-7304	1552-4531				DEC	2013	28	6					390	402		10.1177/0748730413512454								WOS:000328102700003	24336417

Host testing, establishment and biology of the gorse soft shoot moth, Agonopterix umbellana (Fabricius) (Lepidoptera: Oecophoridae), a potential biological control agent for gorse, Ulex europaeus L. (Fabaceae), in Australia	BIOLOGICAL CONTROL												Host specificity tests on over 250 species or cultivars of plants including 37 Australian native and introduced plant species or cultivars showed that the gorse soft shoot moth, Agonopterix umbellana, would be unlikely to survive on any plant other than gorse in Australia. The first field release was at Jericho, Tasmania during spring 2007. By the summer of 2013 high larval densities of A. umbellana were evident at the release point, with dispersal recorded to a maximum of 200 m over ca. 2 ha. Recoveries at other release sites in Tasmania as well as in South Australia and Victoria suggest that the species will eventually establish across south-eastern Australia. The life cycle of A. umbellana is closely synchronised with gorse phenology. Population increase and dispersal is expected to be slow as a consequence of its univoltine life cycle incorporating the narrow larval feeding period of 3 months when gorse is a suitable food source. At Jericho, oviposition commenced in late winter which enabled hatching to coincide with the presence of new gorse growth for developing larvae. Larvae fed over a 3 month period on new growth available from mid-October to mid-January passing through six instars before pupation. The first adults were recorded in early February emerging in an obligate reproductive diapause which was completed by late July. Controlled temperature cabinets held at 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24 degrees C were used to estimate lower development thresholds (LDT) and thermal constants. The LDT for eggs larvae, pupae and total development were 8.7, 7.5, 7.9 and 7.9 degrees C, respectively and the thermal constants were 143.0 degrees, 526.3 degrees, 278.0 degrees and 971.0 degrees degree days respectively. In the long term, it is hoped that A. umbellana will contribute to the biological control of gorse in Australia. This will be in combination with the gorse seed weevil, Exapion ulicis, the gorse spider mite, Tetranychus lintearius and the gorse thrips, Sericothips staphylinus, even though earlier studies have shown these other agents are constrained either by predation in the case of T. lintearius or the effects of gorse phenology in the case of S. staphylinus and E. ulicis.

Although the distributional range of the pine processionary moth Thaumetopoea pityocampa (Lepidoptera Notodontidae) appears to be expanding northward and upslope with climate warming, the relative importance of climate and endogenous, density-dependent factors has not been clearly documented. We analyzed the population dynamics of the moth using long-term data from two provinces in the Southern Alps (Trento: 1990-2009, Bolzano/Bozen: 1975-2011) to evaluate the relative importance of climate and density-dependent factors as regional drivers. Both summer temperatures and rainfall significantly affected population growth rate, with different outcomes depending on the local conditions. Although previous studies indicated that low winter temperatures have negative effects on insect performance, our analyses did not show any negative effect on the population dynamics. A negative density dependent feedback with a 1-year lag emerged as the most important factor driving the population dynamics in both regions. Potential mechanisms explaining the observed negative density feedback include deterioration of host quality, increased mortality caused by pathogens, and increase of prolonged diapause as an adaptive mechanism to escape adverse conditions.

J	Lucas, TA; Johns, G; Jiang, WC; Yang, LC				Lucas, Timothy A.; Johns, Garrett; Jiang, Wancen; Yang, Lucie			A Population Model of Chaparral Vegetation Response to Frequent Wildfires	BULLETIN OF MATHEMATICAL BIOLOGY												The recent increase in wildfire frequency in the Santa Monica Mountains (SMM) may substantially impact plant community structure. Species of Chaparral shrubs represent the dominant vegetation type in the SMM. These species can be divided into three life history types according to their response to wildfires. Nonsprouting species are completely killed by fire and reproduce by seeds that germinate in response to a fire cue, obligate sprouting species survive by resprouting from dormant buds in a root crown because their seeds are destroyed by fire, and facultative sprouting species recover after fire both by seeds and resprouts. Based on these assumptions, we developed a set of nonlinear difference equations to model each life history type. These models can be used to predict species survivorship under varying fire return intervals. For example, frequent fires can lead to localized extinction of nonsprouting species such as Ceanothus megacarpus while several facultative sprouting species such as Ceanothus spinosus and Malosma (Rhus) laurina will persist as documented by a longitudinal study in a biological preserve in the SMM. We estimated appropriate parameter values for several chaparral species using 25 years of data and explored parameter relationships that lead to equilibrium populations. We conclude by looking at the survival strategies of these three species of chaparral shrubs under varying fire return intervals and predict changes in plant community structure under fire intervals of short return. In particular, our model predicts that an average fire return interval of greater than 12 years is required for 50 % of the initial Ceanothus megacarpus population and 25 % of the initial Ceanothus spinosus population to survive. In contrast, we predict that the Malosma laurina population will have 90 % survivorship for an average fire return interval of at least 6 years.

J	Laska, P				Laska, Pavel			Migration Flight of Carrot Psyllid (Trioza apicalis) at Various Latitudes is Independent of Local Phenology	PLANT PROTECTION SCIENCE												A particularly advantageous method of monitoring the flight and calculating the median was used. An example is given in order to understand better the calculation. The medians show that the timing is similar at different latitudes despite local phenological differences. The difference in median flight times between Finland and the Czech Republic was five days on average, but phenological differences are about a month, shown by a comparison of temperatures, the monitoring of buds on spruce, and by the stage of the carrot plants. During the attack by T apicalis the carrot plants are younger towards north what is unusual in Psyllidae. In extreme north locations as Finland the genetic triggering for flight could not be realised by the strong declining of temperatures. Flight occurs here substantially later as to local photoperiodicity but is the earliest as to phenology, including carrot plants. The very small plants during flight are much more damaged here than the well-developed plants in central Europe.																	1212-2580					DEC	2013	49	4					187	192										WOS:000326146300005

Chilo suppressalis, an important rice pest in Asia enters facultative diapause as larvae. Our results demonstrated in Yangzhou, China, diapause was initiated between September 4 and 12, 2010. After diapause termination, C. suppressalis remained in quiescence in the field for as long as three months. The average time between collection of field larvae of C. suppressalis and their pupation decreased as the season progressed from fall to next spring. Unexpectedly, the pupated ratio of female to male in the initiation of diapause was 0.22. The abundance of hsp90, hsp70, hsp60 and CsAQP1 all peaked on January 8 or 15, 2011. Nitric oxide (NO) is a secondary messenger that is positively correlated with the diapause of C. suppressalis. Among several geographically separated populations of C. suppressalis, there are no significant differences in the mRNA levels of hsp70, hsp60 or CsAQP1.

J	Strauch, M; Volk, M				Strauch, Michael; Volk, Martin			SWAT plant growth modification for improved modeling of perennial vegetation in the tropics	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) has been used for assessing the impact of land cover and land management changes on water resources for a wide range of scales and environmental conditions across the globe. However, originally designed for temperate regions, SWAT must be critically examined for its appropriate use in tropical watersheds. One major concern is the simulation of perennial tropical vegetation due to the absence of dormancy. While for temperate regions SWAT uses dormancy to terminate growing seasons of trees and perennials, seasonality in the tropics (wet and dry season) can only be represented by defining date or heat unit specific "plant" and "kill" operations which are fixed for every year of simulation. In this paper, we discuss these shortcomings and present an alternative approach to automatically initiate annual growing cycles based on changes in soil moisture. Furthermore, we propose a logistic leaf area index (LAI) decline function which approaches a user-defined minimum LAI instead of using the default function, which is not considering the minimum LAI. The modified SWAT model was tested based on MODIS LAI and evapotranspiration data for the Santa Maria/Torto watershed in Central Brazil, covered mostly by Cerrado (savanna) vegetation. Our model results show that the modified model can reasonably represent seasonal dynamics of the Cerrado biome. However, since the proposed changes are process-based but also allow flexible model settings (e.g. the beginning of growing cycles based on a soil moisture threshold adjustable for plant/land cover types), the modified plant growth module should be useful for large parts of the model community.

We examined sequence variation for two mitochondrial gene fragments (COI and 16S for a subset of the data) in a large set of population samples representing the entire native range of A. franciscana. Furthermore, we performed Mantel tests and redundancy analyses (RDA) to test the role of flyways, geography and human introductions on the phylogeography and population genetic structure at a continental scale. A. franciscana mitochondrial DNA was very diverse, with two main clades, largely corresponding to Pacific and Atlantic populations, mirroring American bird flyways. There was a high degree of regional endemism, with populations subdivided into at least 12 divergent, geographically restricted and largely allopatric mitochondrial lineages, and high levels of population structure (Phi(ST) of 0.92), indicating low ongoing gene flow. We found evidence of human-mediated introductions in nine out of 39 populations analysed. Once these populations were removed, Mantel tests revealed a strong association between genetic variation and geographic distance (i.e., isolation-by-distance pattern). RDA showed that shared bird flyways explained around 20% of the variance in genetic distance between populations and this was highly significant, once geographic distance was controlled for. The variance explained increased to 30% when the factor human introduction was included in the model. Our findings suggest that bird-mediated transport of brine shrimp propagules does not result in substantial ongoing gene flow; instead, it had a significant historical role on the current species phylogeography, facilitating the colonisation of new aquatic environments as they become available along their main migratory flyways.

In Italy, it infests about 70% of the total rice area. Different Weedy Rice populations can be distinguished based on variable morphological and physiological traits; however, little is known about genetic differentiation and origin of Italian weedy rice populations. The objective of this study was to genetically and morphologically characterize and compare different Italian weedy rice populations selected on the basis of different phenotypes. The main Italian rice territory was divided into 10 geographical areas in which 40 weedy rice populations were collected and grouped according to the awn traits. All the individuals of the populations were morphologically characterized according to plant and seed traits. Genetic characterization was performed using 19 SSR markers on all the collected accessions, and several rice cultivars, including some very old (late 19th century), nowadays are no longer cultivated. ANOVA showed that morphological plant and seed traits were significantly affected by the collection area and awnedness group. The importance of the awn morphology was also reflected in the Bayesian clustering where, despite a relatively low genetic diversity, the clusters displayed different awn types. An UPGMA dendrogram confirmed the clusters detected in STRUCTURE analysis and also revealed a grouping of certain old cultivars with the weedy rice, suggesting a common origin.

Temperature- and density-dependence of diapause induction and its life history correlates in the geometrid moth Chiasmia clathrata (Lepidoptera: Geometridae)	EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY												The relative roles of genetics and developmental plasticity in creating phenotypes adapted to prevailing conditions are insufficiently understood. In potentially multivoltine temperate insects, individuals that do not enter diapause but develop directly into reproductive adults within the same season are severely time-constrained. Direct development is, however, under selection only if expressed in the wild. Thus, adaptive correlates of the direct development are expected to evolve and persist only in multivoltine populations. We studied the genetic and phenotypic components of variation in juvenile development in the geometrid moth Chiasmia clathrata from univoltine and bivoltine regions. Larvae were reared at two temperatures (14/20 A degrees C) and densities (low/high) in a factorial split-brood experiment. High temperature and low density promoted direct development, the former condition being associated with a short development time, high growth rate and large body size. Genotypes of bivoltine origin had a higher propensity for direct development and seemingly expressed an exaggerated plastic response to increasing temperature compared to the ones from univoltine populations. Alternative life history phenotypes associated with the induced developmental pathway emerged only in the bivoltine region, direct development resulting in a short larval period, high growth rate and small size at 20 A degrees C there. The degree of differentiation between the developmental pathways was insensitive to larval density; high density only decreased both development time and body size to a certain degree. We conclude that the differences between the pathways are not due to the induction of a particular pathway itself, but geographically varying selection pressures shape the correlation structure among life history traits and their pathway-specific expression.

However, the evolution of alternative life-history phenotypes remains poorly understood. Here, we analyze the evolution of alternative life histories in seasonal environments by using temperate insects as a model system. Temperate insects express alternative developmental pathways of diapause and direct development, the induction of a certain pathway affecting fitness through its life-history correlates. We develop a methodologically novel and holistic simulation model and optimize development time, growth rate, body size, reproductive effort, and adult life span simultaneously in both developmental pathways. The model predicts that direct development should be associated with shorter development time (duration of growth) and adult life span, higher growth rate and reproductive effort, smaller body size as well as lower fecundity compared to the diapause pathway, because the two generations divide the available time unequally. These predictions are consistent with many empirical data. Our analysis shows that seasonality alone can explain the evolution of alternative life histories.

Evaluating rRNA as an indicator of microbial activity in environmental communities: limitations and uses	ISME JOURNAL												Microbes exist in a range of metabolic states (for example, dormant, active and growing) and analysis of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is frequently employed to identify the 'active' fraction of microbes in environmental samples. While rRNA analyses are no longer commonly used to quantify a population's growth rate in mixed communities, due to rRNA concentration not scaling linearly with growth rate uniformly across taxa, rRNA analyses are still frequently used toward the more conservative goal of identifying populations that are currently active in a mixed community. Yet, evidence indicates that the general use of rRNA as a reliable indicator of metabolic state in microbial assemblages has serious limitations. This report highlights the complex and often contradictory relationships between rRNA, growth and activity. Potential mechanisms for confounding rRNA patterns are discussed, including differences in life histories, life strategies and non-growth activities. Ways in which rRNA data can be used for useful characterization of microbial assemblages are presented, along with questions to be addressed in future studies.

Winter diet of the little auk (Alle alle) in the Northwest Atlantic	POLAR BIOLOGY												The little auk (Alle alle) is one of the most numerous seabirds in the world, but their winter prey selection has never been thoroughly studied. In the present study, we analyzed the proventricular contents of 205 little auks caught in coastal areas off southwest Greenland during December-February and off Newfoundland in March. Large Calanoid copepods are known to be the main prey during summer. We found krill to become the crucial winter prey in both areas, followed by Themisto spp. and young capelin (Mallotus villosus). No difference was found between the diet of juvenile and adult birds. Copepods constituted around 1 % of the diet and close to all copepods were in birds caught near Cape Farwell in December. These findings provide new and important insight into the forage ecology of the little auk, and they support other studies showing that large Calanoid copepods in the Arctic decent for winter hibernation at depths that are below the diving range of the little auks. More studies to determine offshore diet and annual variation are, however, needed in order to get a more complete picture.

We thus investigated whether ecological and life-history traits differ between butterfly communities of grasslands with different land-use intensity. We conducted butterfly transect surveys in 137 grassland sites in three regions of Germany and compiled 10 species-specific ecological and life-history traits from the literature. These traits are associated with food plant specialisation, dispersal, distribution, reproduction and development. We calculated a land-use intensity gradient based on the amount of fertilise mowing frequency and grazing intensity. We analysed differences of traits characteristics between butterfly communities along the land-use intensity gradient in a fourth-corner analysis, thus considering correlations between traits. Six ecological and life-history traits changed from characteristics associated with specialists to such associated with generalists with increasing land-use intensity. These traits characteristics in intensified grasslands were: high dispersal propensity, large distribution range, low population density, more than one generation per year, hibernation in a more advanced developmental stage and a long flight period. The functional homogenisation of the butterfly communities with changes from specialist to generalist trait characteristics with increasing land-use intensity may have severe consequences for ecosystem functioning and services.

J.; McCarthy, Jayd; King, Anthony; Shabbir, Asad			Development of cat's claw creeper leaf-tying moth Hypocosmia pyrochroma (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) at different temperatures: Implications for establishment as a biological control agent in Australia and South Africa	BIOLOGICAL CONTROL												The leaf-tying moth Hypocosmia pyrochroma Jones (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), a native of sub tropical South America, has been introduced as a biological control agent for cat's claw creeper, Dolichandra unguis-cati (L.) Lohman (Bignoniaceae), in Australia and South Africa. So far there has been no evidence of its field establishment in either country. A narrow temperature tolerance is a potential limiting factor for the establishment of weed biological control insects in novel habitats. In this study, we evaluated the effect of seven constant temperatures (12-40 degrees C) on the survival and development of H. pyrochroma in temperature-controlled cabinets. Temperatures between 20 and 30 degrees C were the most favorable for adult survival, oviposition, egg hatching, and larval and pupal development. Adult survival (12-40 degrees C) and egg development (15-35 degrees C) showed tolerance for wider temperature ranges than oviposition, and larval and pupal development, which were all negatively affected by both high (> 30 degrees C) and low (< 20 degrees C) temperatures. The degree-day (DD) requirement to complete a generation was estimated as 877 above a threshold temperature of 12 degrees C. Based on DD requirements and an obligatory winter diapause of pupae from midautumn to mid-spring, the potential number of generations (egg to adult) the leaf-tying moth can complete in a year in Australia or South Africa range from one to three. A climate-matching model predicted that the inland regions of both Australia and South Africa are less favorable for H. pyrochroma than the coastal areas. The study suggested that H. pyrochroma is more likely to establish in the coastal areas of Australia where most of the cat's claw creeper infestations occur, than in South Africa where most of the cat's claw creeper infestations are inland.

RNA-Seq reveals early distinctions and late convergence of gene expression between diapause and quiescence in the Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY												Dormancy is a crucial adaptation allowing insects to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The pre-programmed developmental arrest of diapause is a form of dormancy that is distinct from quiescence, in which development arrests in immediate response to hardship. Much progress has been made in understanding the environmental and hormonal controls of diapause. However, studies identifying transcriptional changes unique to diapause, rather than quiescence, are lacking, making it difficult to disentangle the transcriptional profiles of diapause from dormancy in general. The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, presents an ideal model for such a study, as diapausing and quiescent eggs can be staged and collected for global gene expression profiling using a newly developed transcriptome. Here, we use RNA-Seq to contrast gene expression during diapause with quiescence to identify transcriptional changes specific to the diapause response. We identify global trends in gene expression that show gradual convergence of diapause gene expression upon gene expression during quiescence. Functionally, early diapause A. albopictus show strong expression differences of genes involved in metabolism, which diminish over time. Of these, only expression of lipid metabolism genes remained distinct in late diapause. We identify several genes putatively related to hormonal control of development that are persistently differentially expressed throughout diapause, suggesting these might be involved in the maintenance of diapause. Our results identify key biological differences between diapausing and quiescent pharate larvae, and suggest candidate pathways for studying metabolism and the hormonal control of development during diapause in other species.

J	Godbold, JA; Solan, M				Godbold, Jasmin A.; Solan, Martin			Long-term effects of warming and ocean acidification are modified by seasonal variation in species responses and environmental conditions	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Warming of sea surface temperatures and alteration of ocean chemistry associated with anthropogenic increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide will have profound consequences for a broad range of species, but the potential for seasonal variation to modify species and ecosystem responses to these stressors has received little attention. Here, using the longest experiment to date (542 days), we investigate how the interactive effects of warming and ocean acidification affect the growth, behaviour and associated levels of ecosystem functioning (nutrient release) for a functionally important non-calcifying intertidal polychaete (Alitta virens) under seasonally changing conditions. We find that the effects of warming, ocean acidification and their interactions are not detectable in the short term, but manifest over time through changes in growth, bioturbation and bioirrigation behaviour that, in turn, affect nutrient generation. These changes are intimately linked to species responses to seasonal variations in environmental conditions (temperature and photoperiod) that, depending upon timing, can either exacerbate or buffer the long-term directional effects of climatic forcing. Taken together, our observations caution against over emphasizing the conclusions from short-term experiments and highlight the necessity to consider the temporal expression of complex system dynamics established over appropriate timescales when forecasting the likely ecological consequences of climatic forcing.

However, sufficiently long time series in ecology are scarce. The research presented here analyzes a long-term data set collected by the Hungarian Forest Research Institute over the period 1961-2009. The number of hectares with visible defoliation was estimated and documented for several forest insect pest species. This resulted in a unique time series that provides us with the opportunity to compare insect damage trends with trends in weather patterns. Data were analyzed for six lepidopteran species: Thaumetopoea processionea, Tortrix viridana, Rhyacionia buoliana, Malacosoma neustria, Euproctis chrysorrhoea, and Lymantria dispar. All these species exhibit outbreak dynamics in Hungary. Five of these species prefer deciduous tree species as their host plants, whereas R.buoliana is a specialist on Pinus spp. The data were analyzed using general linear models and generalized least squares regression in relation to mean monthly temperature and precipitation. Temperature increased considerably, especially over the last 25years (+1.6 degrees C), whereas precipitation exhibited no trend over the period. No change in weather variability over time was observed. There was increased damage caused by two species on deciduous trees. The area of damage attributed to R.buoliana decreased over the study period. There was no evidence of increased variability in damage. We conclude that species exhibiting a trend toward outbreak-level damage over a greater geographical area may be positively affected by changes in weather conditions coinciding with important life stages. Strong associations between the geographical extent of severe damage and monthly temperature and precipitation are difficult to confirm, studying the life-history traits of species could help to increase understanding of responses to climate change.					klapwijk, maartje johanna/0000-0001-7690-045X												2045-7758					OCT	2013	3	12					4183	4196		10.1002/ece3.717								WOS:000326286700012	24324869

Phenology, synchrony and host range of the Tasmanian population of Cotesia urabae introduced into New Zealand for the biocontrol of Uraba lugens	BIOCONTROL												The population dynamics of Cotesia urabae (Austin and Allen) (Braconidae: Microgastrinae), a biological control agent from Tasmania, and its eucalypt feeding host, Uraba lugens (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Nolidae) was investigated prior to its introduction to New Zealand in 2011. Previous host range testing on potential New Zealand non-targets determined C. urabae had some potential to attack an endemic species, Nyctemera annulata (Boisduval) (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae). A closely related species in Tasmania, Nyctemera amica, was thus investigated as a potential host along with the native host U. lugens, to better understand the host range of C. urabae and the synchrony with its host in Tasmania. Adult C. urabae emerged from pupal cocoons in the field during January which confirmed a five month window in which its host, the larvae of U. lugens, was absent in the field. Experiments using sentinel N. amica and U. lugens larvae, field collections of N. amica and of larvae of other Lepidopteran species during this five month time window detected no parasitism by C. urabae. In the laboratory, host specificity testing showed reduced attack rates and no resultant C. urabae eggs or developing larvae or any successful pupation of C. urabae larvae from attacked N. amica larvae. It was concluded that N. amica is most unlikely to be a host for C. urabae in Tasmania and no evidence of any other alternative host was found.																	1386-6141					OCT	2013	58	5					625	633		10.1007/s10526-013-9524-0								WOS:000324109500005						
J	Jiang, H; Barbier, H; Brutnell, T				Jiang, Hui; Barbier, Hugues; Brutnell, Thomas			Methods for Performing Crosses in Setaria viridis, a New Model System for the Grasses	JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS												Setaria viridis is an emerging model system for C4 grasses. It is closely related to the bioenergy feed stock switchgrass and the grain crop foxtail millet. Recently, the 510 Mb genome of foxtail millet, S. italica, has been sequenced(1,2) and a 25x coverage genome sequence of the weedy relative S. viridis is in progress. S. viridis has a number of characteristics that make it a potentially excellent model genetic system including a rapid generation time, small stature, simple growth requirements, prolific seed production(3) and developed systems for both transient and stable transformation(4). However, the genetics of S. viridis is largely unexplored, in part, due to the lack of detailed methods for performing crosses. To date, no standard protocol has been adopted that will permit rapid production of seeds from controlled crosses. The protocol presented here is optimized for performing genetic crosses in S. viridis, accession A10.1. We have employed a simple heat treatment with warm water for emasculation after pruning the panicle to retain 20-30 florets and labeling of flowers to eliminate seeds resulting from newly developed flowers after emasculation. After testing a series of heat treatments at permissive temperatures and varying the duration of dipping, we have established an optimum temperature and time range of 48 degrees C for 3-6 min. By using this method, a minimum of 15 crosses can be performed by a single worker per day and an average of 3-5 outcross progeny per panicle can be recovered. Therefore, an average of 45-75 outcross progeny can be produced by one person in a single day. Broad implementation of this technique will facilitate the development of recombinant inbred line populations of S. viridis X S. viridis or S. viridis X S. italica, mapping mutations through bulk segregant analysis and creating higher order mutants for genetic analysis.

Stress granules form in Brachionus manjavacas (Rotifera) in response to a variety of stressors	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY A-MOLECULAR & INTEGRATIVE PHYSIOLOGY												Many eukaryotes share a common response to environmental stresses. The responses include reorganization of cellular organelles and proteins. Similar stress responses between divergent species suggest that these protective mechanisms may have evolved early and been retained from the earliest eukaryotic ancestors. Many eukaryotic cells have the capacity to sequester proteins and mRNAs into transient stress granules (SGs) that protect most cellular mRNAs (Anderson and Kedersha, 2008). Our observations extend the phylogenetic range of SGs from trypanosomatids, insects, yeast and mammalian cells, where they were first described, to a species of the lophotrochozoan animal phylum Rotifera. We focus on the distribution of three proteins known to be associated with both ribosomes and SG formation: eukaryotic initiation factors eIF3B, eIF4E and T-cell-restricted intracellular antigen 1. We found that these three proteins co-localize to SGs in rotifers in response to temperature stress, osmotic stress and nutrient deprivation as has been described in other eukaryotes. We have also found that the large ribosomal subunit fails to localize to the SGs in rotifers. Furthermore, the SGs in rotifers disperse once the environmental stress is removed as demonstrated in yeast and mammalian cells. These results are consistent with SG formation in trypanosomatids, insects, yeast and mammalian cells, further supporting the presence of this protective mechanism early in the evolution of eukaryotes.

GCGH Biomarkers TB Consortium	Analysis of Host Responses to Mycobacterium tuberculosis Antigens in a Multi-Site Study of Subjects with Different TB and HIV Infection States in Sub-Saharan Africa	PLOS ONE												Background: Tuberculosis (TB) remains a global health threat with 9 million new cases and 1.4 million deaths per year. In order to develop a protective vaccine, we need to define the antigens expressed by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), which are relevant to protective immunity in high-endemic areas. Methods: We analysed responses to 23 Mtb antigens in a total of 1247 subjects with different HIV and TB status across 5 geographically diverse sites in Africa (South Africa, The Gambia, Ethiopia, Malawi and Uganda). We used a 7-day whole blood assay followed by IFN-gamma ELISA on the supernatants. Antigens included PPD, ESAT-6 and Ag85B (dominant antigens) together with novel resuscitation-promoting factors (rpf), reactivation proteins, latency (Mtb DosR regulon-encoded) antigens, starvation-induced antigens and secreted antigens. Results: There was variation between sites in responses to the antigens, presumably due to underlying genetic and environmental differences. When results from all sites were combined, HIV- subjects with active TB showed significantly lower responses compared to both TST- and TST+ contacts to latency antigens (Rv0569, Rv1733, Rv1735, Rv1737) and the rpf Rv0867; whilst responses to ESAT-6/CFP-10 fusion protein (EC), PPD, Rv2029, TB10.3, and TB10.4 were significantly higher in TST+ contacts (LTBI) compared to TB and TST- contacts fewer differences were seen in subjects with HIV co-infection, with responses to the mitogen PHA significantly lower in subjects with active TB compared to those with LTBI and no difference with any antigen. Conclusions: Our multi-site study design for testing novel Mtb antigens revealed promising antigens for future vaccine development. The IFN-gamma ELISA is a cheap and useful tool for screening potential antigenicity in subjects with different ethnic backgrounds and across a spectrum of TB and HIV infection states. Analysis of cytokines other than IFN-gamma is currently on-going to determine correlates of protection, which may be useful for vaccine efficacy trials.

Stratification Requirements for Seed Dormancy Alleviation in a Wetland Weed	PLOS ONE												Echinochloaoryzicola(syn.E. phyllopogon) is an exotic weed of California rice paddies that has evolved resistance to multiple herbicides. Elimination of seedlingsthroughcertain weed control methods can limit the spread of this weed, but is contingent on accurate predictions of germination and emergence timing, which are influenced by seed dormancy levels. In summer annuals, dormancy can often be relieved through stratification, a period of prolonged exposure to cold and moist conditions. We used population-based threshold models to quantify the effects of stratification on seed germination of four E. Oryzicola populations at a range of water potential (Psi) and oxygen levels. We also determined how stratification temperatures, moisture levels and durations contributed to dormancy release. Stratification released dormancy by decreasing base Psi and hydrotimerequired for germination and by eliminating any germination sensitivity to oxygen. Stratification also increased average germination rates (GR), which were used as a proxy for relative dormancy levels. Alternating temperatures nearly doubled GR in all populations, indicating that seeds could be partially dormant despite achieving high final germination percentages. Stratification at Psi=0 MPa increased GR compared to stratification at lower water potentials, demonstrating that Psi contributed to regulating dormancy release. Maximum GR occurred after 2-4 weeks of stratification at 0 MPa; GR were often more rapid for herbicide-resistant than for herbicide-susceptible seeds, implying greater dormancy in the latter. Manipulation of field conditions to promote dormancy alleviation of E. oryzicola seeds might improve the rate and uniformity of germination for seed bank depletion through seedling weed control. Our results suggest field soil saturation in winter would contribute towards E. oryzicola dormancy release and decrease the time to seedling emergence.																	1932-6203					SEP 5	2013	8	9							e71457	10.1371/journal.pone.0071457								WOS:000324481600010	24039714

Photoperiodic responses from 5 different geographical populations showed that the variation in critical photoperiod for diapause induction was positively related to the latitudinal origin of the populations at 20, 22 and 25 degrees C. Diapause response to photoperiod and temperature was quite different between northern and southern populations, being highly sensitive to photoperiod in northern populations and temperature dependence in southern populations. Diapause pupae from southern population showed a significantly shorter diapause duration than from northern-most populations when they were cultured at 20, 22, 25, 28 and 31 degrees C; by contrast, overwintering pupae from southern populations emerged significantly later than from northern populations when they were maintained in natural conditions, showing a clinal latitudinal variation in diapause termination. Diapause-inducing temperature had a significant effect on diapause duration, but with a significant difference between southern and northern populations. The higher rearing temperature of 22 degrees C evoked a more intense diapause than did 20 degrees C in northern populations; but a less intense diapause in southern population. Cold exposure (chilling) is not necessary to break the pupal diapause. The higher the temperature, the quicker the diapause terminated. Response of diapause termination to chilling showed that northern populations were more sensitive to chilling than southern population. All results demonstrate that H. armigera is not genetically homogeneous throughout its range, but rather is composed of distinct populations genetically adapted to local environmental conditions despite the potential for gene flow via seasonal migration of adults.

Rht-1 and Ppd-D1 associations with height, GA sensitivity, and days to heading in a worldwide bread wheat collection	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS												Reduced height (Rht)-1 and Photoperiod (Ppd) have major effects on the adaptability of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) to specific environments. Ppd-D1a is a photoperiod insensitive allele that reduces time to flowering. The gibberellin (GA) insensitive alleles Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b shorten plant stature and were important components of the 'green revolution'. Two additional Rht-B1 alleles were recently identified that contain a 160 or 197 bp insertion upstream of the coding region and may affect plant height or GA sensitivity Wilhelm et al. (Theor Appl Gen doi:10.1007/s00122-013-2088-7, 2013b). We determined the frequency of the five alleles in a worldwide core collection of 372 wheat accessions (372CC) and estimated their effects on height, days to heading, and GA sensitivity when the collection was grown in pots outdoors or in the glasshouse. This revealed that each allele was widespread geographically with frequencies ranging from 0.12 to 0.25. Ppd-D1a was associated with significant (p <= 0.05) reductions in days to heading and height relative to photoperiod sensitive Ppd-D1b. Relative to wild type, Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b each resulted in significant reductions in height (approximately 30 %) and GA sensitivity. The 160 and 197 bp alleles were associated with significant height reductions of 18 and 12 %, respectively, and with nonsignificant reductions in GA sensitivity relative to wild type. Two statistical methods were developed and used to estimate GA sensitivity of the 372CC accessions, but novel GA insensitive alleles were not identified. Further characterization of the Rht-B1 insertion alleles is required, but our results suggest these may enable fine adjustments in plant height.																	0040-5752					SEP	2013	126	9					2233	2243		10.1007/s00122-013-2130-9								WOS:000323671100003	23722594

Heritability and Inter-Population Differences in Lipid Profiles of Drosophila melanogaster	PLOS ONE												Characterizing and understanding the complex spectrum of lipids in higher organisms lags far behind our analysis of genome and transcriptome sequences. Here we generate and evaluate comprehensive lipid profiles (>200 lipids) of 92 inbred lines from five different Drosophila melanogaster populations. We find that the majority of lipid species are highly heritable, and even lipids with odd-chain fatty acids, which cannot be generated by the fly itself, also have high heritabilities. Abundance of the endosymbiont Wolbachia, a potential provider of odd-chained lipids, was positively correlated with this group of lipids. Additionally, we show that despite years of laboratory rearing on the same medium, the lipid profiles of the five geographic populations are sufficiently distinct for population discrimination. Our data predicts a strikingly different membrane fluidity for flies from the Netherlands, which is supported by their increased ethanol tolerance. We find that 18% of lipids show strong concentration differences between males and females. Through an analysis of the correlation structure of the lipid classes, we find modules of co-regulated lipids and begin to associate these with metabolic constraints. Our data provide a foundation for developing associations between variation in lipid composition with variation in other metabolic attributes, with genome-wide variation, and with metrics of health and overall reproductive fitness.																	1932-6203					AUG 27	2013	8	8							e72726	10.1371/journal.pone.0072726								WOS:000323815200054	24013349					
J	Lister, DL; Jones, H; Jones, MK; O'Sullivan, DM; Cockram, J				Lister, Diane L.; Jones, Huw; Jones, Martin K.; O'Sullivan, Donal M.; Cockram, James			Analysis of DNA polymorphism in ancient barley herbarium material: Validation of the KASP SNP genotyping platform	TAXON												The availability of crop specimens archived in herbaria and old seed collections represent valuable resources for the analysis of plant genetic diversity and crop domestication. The ability to extract ancient DNA (aDNA) from such samples has recently allowed molecular genetic investigations to be undertaken in ancient materials. While analyses of aDNA initially focused on the use of markers which occur in multiple copies such as the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) within ribosomal DNA and those requiring amplification of short DNA regions of variable length such as simple sequence repeats (SSRs), emphasis is now moving towards the genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), traditionally undertaken in aDNA by Sanger sequencing. Here, using a panel of barley aDNA samples previously surveyed by Sanger sequencing for putative causative SNPs within the flowering-time gene PPD-H1, we assess the utility of the Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP) genotyping platform for aDNA analysis. We find KASP to out-perform Sanger sequencing in the genotyping of aDNA samples (78% versus 61% success, respectively), as well as being robust to contamination. The small template size (>= 46 bp) and one-step, closed-tube amplification/genotyping process make this platform ideally suited to the genotypic analysis of aDNA, a process which is often hampered by template DNA degradation and sample cross-contamination. Such attributes, as well as its flexibility of use and relatively low cost, make KASP particularly relevant to the genetic analysis of aDNA samples. Furthermore, KASP provides a common platform for the genotyping and analysis of corresponding SNPs in ancient, landrace and modern plant materials. The extended haplotype analysis of PPD-HI undertaken here (allelic variation at which is thought to be important for the spread of domestication and local adaptation) provides further resolution to the previously identified geographic cline of flowering-time allele distribution, illustrating how KASP can be used to aid genetic analyses of aDNA from plant species. We further demonstrate the utility of KASP by genotyping ten additional genetic markers diagnostic for morphological traits in barley, shedding light on the phenotypic traits, alleles and allele combinations present in these unviable ancient specimens, as well as their geographic distributions.

Patterns of Selective Caching Behavior of a Generalist Herbivore, the American Pika (Ochotona princeps)	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Caching decisions have been studied for many species, but large-scale variation of selective preferences due to environmental heterogeneity has rarely been examined. We investigated large-scale patterns of selective caching behavior in the American pika (Ochotona princeps), a non-hibernating generalist herbivore that caches vegetation in haypiles to serve as winter food. At 13 sites throughout the southern Rocky Mountains, we identified the three most common available and cached plant species and analyzed them for dietary quality. Selectivity at each site was measured as the difference between average quality of the most common cached and available vegetation. Pikas consistently cached materials of higher quality than the most common available vegetation. Selectivity for high nitrogen corresponded to quality of available plants and site summer temperature, whereas selectivity for high water content was negatively correlated with elevation. Our results indicate that pikas cache a variety of plant materials while using different selectivity cues, illustrating the complexity of pika caching behavior across a range of environmental conditions and forage values. Future studies on caching behavior should take into account differential selectivity due to environmental heterogeneity.																	1523-0430	1938-4246				AUG	2013	45	3					396	403		10.1657/1938-4246-45.3.396								WOS:000329533200009

Australian distribution, genetic status and seasonal abundance of the exotic mosquito Culex molestus (Forskal) (Diptera: Culicidae)	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY												Culex molestus was probably introduced into Australia in the 1940s and represents a potentially important nuisance-biting pest and vector of disease-causing pathogens in urban areas. The aims of this study were to review the literature to determine the current and historical distribution of Cx. molestus in Australia, analyse the genetic similarity of specimens collected from various locations in Australia with reference to specimens from North America, Asia and Europe, and document the seasonal abundance of this mosquito in the Sydney region. Results showed that Cx. molestus is common in southern Australia, but there was no evidence that this mosquito is found north of latitude 28.17 degrees S. Molecular analysis indicated that specimens from various locations throughout Australia shared strong genetic similarity and that it was most likely introduced from Asia, possibly through multiple introductions over the past 70 years. Analysis of the seasonal abundance of Cx. molestus indicated that the species does not display diapause during the cooler months. Consideration should be given to the unique biology and ecology of this species when assessing the public health risk and the surveillance methods required in the management of Cx. molestus within urban areas of Australia.

Frequency and Distribution of Extended Diapause in Nebraska Populations of Diabrotica barberi (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae)	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY												The frequency of extended diapause in populations of the northern corn rootworm, Diabrotica barberi Smith & Lawrence (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), was measured in eastern Nebraska. Adult collections were made during late summer in 2008 and 2009 from eight sites each year (seven sites were consistent over years). Eggs were obtained from 12 to 20 females per site and were held on moist soil under appropriate temperature profiles to facilitate egg survival, diapause development, and diapause termination. Percentage egg hatch was recorded after the first and second year for the 2008 and 2009 collections. Additional extended diapause expression was estimated for the 2008 and 2009 collections by counting remaining live eggs after the second-year egg hatch was completed. These data also were used to estimate each site's maximum egg viability. Results collectively indicate that the extended diapause trait was present in all eastern Nebraska populations; however, significant variation in the frequency of extended diapause was observed within and among D. barberi populations (first-year mean percentage egg hatch range: 2008 collections: 4.5-38.6%; 2009 collections: 10.7-42.5%). Geographically, the highest incidence of extended diapause was found along a north-south transect in eastern counties of Nebraska that parallels the Missouri River. In general, the frequency of extended diapause was lower in sites found west of the north-south transect. This study contributes to the knowledge base needed to develop appropriate D. barberi management strategies in Nebraska. These data can be used to pinpoint areas of Nebraska that may have the greatest risk of economic injury in first-year corn (Zea mays L.) when D. barberi densities are high.																	0022-0493					AUG	2013	106	4					1619	1627		10.1603/EC12478								WOS:000323043000014	24020274					
J	Lankinen, P; Tyukmaeva, VI; Hoikkala, A				Lankinen, Pekka; Tyukmaeva, Venera I.; Hoikkala, Anneli			Northern Drosophila montana flies show variation both within and between cline populations in the critical day length evoking reproductive diapause	JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY												Reproductive diapause, and its correct timing, plays an important role in the life cycle of many insect species living in a seasonally varying environment at high latitudes. In the present paper we have documented variation in the critical day length (CDL) for adult reproductive diapause and the steepness of photoperiodic response curves (PPRCs) in seven clinal populations of Drosophila montana in Finland between the latitudes 61 and 67 degrees N, paying special attention to variation in these traits within and between dine populations. The isofemale lines representing these populations showed a sharp transition from 0% to 100% in females' diapause incidence in the shortening day lengths, indicated by steep PPRCs. The mean CDL showed a clear latitudinal dine decreasing by 1.6 h from North to South regardless of the age of the lines, variation within the populations (i.e. among lines) in this trait being up to 3 h. The steepness of the PPRCs correlated with the age of the line and this trait showed no clear latitudinal dine. Further studies on a large number of lines from one D. montana population confirmed that while maintaining the flies in diapause preventing conditions in the laboratory has no effect on CDL, older lines had steeper PPRCs. High variation in CDL within and between D. montana dine populations is likely to be heritable and provide a good potential for the evolution of photoperiodic responses. Information on genetic variation in life-history traits, such as diapause, is of utmost importance for predicting the ability of insects to survive in seasonally changing environmental conditions and to respond to long term changes in the length of the growing period e.g. by postponing the timing of diapause towards shorter day length and later calendar date.

Open Top Chambers and Infrared Lamps: A Comparison of Heating Efficacy and CO2/CH4 Dynamics in a Northern Michigan Peatland	ECOSYSTEMS												Open top chambers (OTCs) and infrared (IR) lamps have been widely used for experimentally warming ecosystems, especially in high latitude and alpine regions. The efficacy of OTCs and IR lamps is variable, yet there has not been a direct, experimentally controlled comparison of these warming methods. We, therefore, implemented a factorial study in a northern Michigan peatland to test how warming and microtopography interacted to affect micrometeorological parameters and CO2 and CH4 flux rates. IR lamps significantly warmed the soil (5 cm depth; P < 0.05) by 1.4 and 1.9A degrees C in 2009 and 2010, respectively, with the majority of warming occurring during nighttime hours. OTCs did not provide any long-term warming increase compared to control plots, which is contrary to OTC studies at high latitudes. By investigating diurnal heating patterns and micrometeorological variables, we determined that OTCs were not achieving strong daytime heating peaks and were often cooler than controls during nighttime hours. Temperate day-length, cloudy and humid conditions, and latent heat loss were factors that may have inhibited OTC warming. Warming treatments created mixed effects on gas flux components. Within drier, hummock plots, IR lamps significantly increased gross ecosystem production (GEP) but not ecosystem respiration (ER), whereas OTCs had no effect on GEP or ER in hummocks. In wetter, lawn plots, warming treatments had no effect on CO2 flux or CH4 flux. We show here that IR lamps are more effective than OTCs for studying how temperate peatlands may respond to increased temperatures.																	1432-9840					AUG	2013	16	5					736	748		10.1007/s10021-013-9646-3								WOS:000321911200003

Development of Chrysomya albiceps (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Calliphoridae) in Different Pig Tissues	NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY												Chrysomya albiceps (Wiedemann) has been encountered breeding in animal carcasses and human bodies in many geographical regions. This species is considered an important postmortem indicator for Medical Legal Forensic Entomology. Studies have also demonstrated its capacity to develop in various natural and semi-synthetic substrates. The present study was undertaken to examine the development of immature C. albiceps in four different pig tissues. Eggs of this fly were deposited in flasks containing liver, abdominal fat, meat, and brain tissues. The flasks were maintained in an incubator at 25 +/- 1A degrees C, 70 A +/- 10% humidity, and 12-h/12-h photoperiod until emergence of the imagoes. Samples of the larvae were taken from different tissues/substrates to be weighed and measured. Their respective rates of development were accompanied. Comparisons among data from the different tissues indicated differences in the size and rate of development of larvae of the same age. Males emerged, on average, 1 day before females. Considerations as to the differences encountered for the estimate of postmortem interval were elaborated and consequences for the accuracy of the inferences discussed. The results indicate that such inferences should consider the disparities in the development of larvae presented by this species in different tissues.																	1519-566X					AUG	2013	42	4					426	430		10.1007/s13744-013-0134-4								WOS:000321919300013	23949864					
J	Hassall, C				Hassall, Christopher			Time stress and temperature explain continental variation in damselfly body size	ECOGRAPHY												Body size is among the most important biological variables but despite much measurement of this trait, the factors driving its variation are not fully understood. Here, I describe variation in body size in the damselfly Calopteryx maculata to establish whether variations in growth and development observed in response to experimental manipulation of temperature and time stress in the laboratory can be scaled-up to variation among natural populations. Nine hundred and seven specimens of C. maculata males were collected from 34 sites across the species' entire range in North America during the summer of 2010. A general measure of body size was derived from a series of wing and leg measurements. I compare the fit of models based on latitude (Bergmann's rule), temperature (the temperature-size rule) and seasonal effects (a combination of temperature and time stress) using Akaike's information criterion (AIC). The U-shaped relationship between size and latitude was best explained by a seasonality model containing both photoperiod and temperature. The presence of both these terms suggests that time stress dominates in the southern part of the range, reducing body size by accelerating development. However, the temperature-size rule dominates in the northern part of the range, increasing body size closer to the northern range margin. The best-fit model of geographic variation in size is in accordance with previous laboratory studies of temperature and photoperiod in damselflies and theoretical work, indicating that the findings from such studies can be applied to natural populations. These findings are likely applicable to any species with complex life histories inhabiting seasonal environments.

J	Sato, Y; Sabelis, MW; Mochizuki, A				Sato, Yukie; Sabelis, Maurice W.; Mochizuki, Atsushi			Asymmetry in male lethal fight between parapatric forms of a social spider mite	EXPERIMENTAL AND APPLIED ACAROLOGY												Closely related species often show adjacent geographic distributions, albeit with some overlap. This contiguity is thought to result from secondary contact between (spatially separated) diverging groups or from parapatric speciation. Fights between males of closely related species will affect their chance to mate with females of the other species, which in turn may promote their spatial segregation and drive their speciation. Stigmaeopsis miscanthi is a social spider mite that lives in a group within self-woven nests on leaves of Chinese silver grass. This mite shows lethal male-male fight as a means to maintain a harem, and has two forms showing differences in the levels of male-male aggression, diapause intensity in females and the relative length of the first to third legs. The two forms show parapatric distributions. We found that males of one form readily engage themselves in lethal fight with males of the other form, thereby acquiring the nests and gaining access to females of this other form. Males of the aggressive form tend to win the fights with males of the other form. Their first legs are longer which may provide them with a better weapon and which also indicate a larger body width. However, another determinant of who wins the fight is the length of the third legs which can be a proxy for body length. Based on these results, we hypothesize that male killing behavior is one of the mechanisms maintaining parapatry (instead of sympatry) of the two spider mite forms apart from difference in diapause attributes.

J	Miller, CL				Miller, Christine L.			Evidence for phenotypic plasticity in response to photic cues and the connection with genes of risk in schizophrenia	FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE												Numerous environmental factors have been identified as influential in the development of schizophrenia. Some are by products of modern life, yet others were present in our evolutionary past and persist to a lesser degree in the current era. The present study brings together published epidemiological data for schizophrenia and data on variables related to photic input for places of residence across geographical regions, using rainfall as an inverse, proxy measure for light levels. Data were gathered from the literature for two countries, the former Yugoslavia and Ireland, during a time in the early 20th century when mobility was relatively limited. The data for Yugoslavia showed a strong correlation between hospital census rates for schizophrenia (by place of birth) and annual rain (r=0.96, p=0.008). In Ireland, the hospital census rates and first admissions for schizophrenia (by place of permanent residence) showed a trend for correlation with annual rain, reaching significance for 1st admissions when the rainfall data was weighted by the underlying population distribution (r=0.71, p=0.047). In addition, across the years 1921-1945, birth-year variations in a spring quarter season-of-birth effect for schizophreniain Ireland showed a trend for correlation with January-March rainfall (r=0.80, p=0.10). The data are discussed in terms of the effect of photoperiod on the gestation and behavior of off spring in animals, and the premiseis put forth that vestigial phenotypic plasticity for such photic cuess till exists in humans. Moreover, genetic polymorphisms of risk identified for psychotic disorders include genes modulated by photoperiod and sunlight intensity. Such a relationship between phenotypic plasticity in response to a particular environmental regime and subsequent natural selection for fixed changes in the environmentally responsive genes, has been well studied in animals and should not be discounted when considering human disease.																	1662-5153					JUL 9	2013	7								82	10.3389/fnbeh.2013.00082								WOS:000321488800001	23847488

Overwintering Biology of Culex (Diptera: Culicidae) Mosquitoes in the Sacramento Valley of California	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY												At temperate latitudes, Culex (Diptera: Culicidae) mosquitoes typically overwinter as adult females in reproductive arrest and also may serve as reservoir hosts for arboviruses when cold temperatures arrest viral replication. To evaluate their role in the persistence of West Nile virus (WNV) in the Sacramento Valley of California, the induction and termination of diapause were investigated for members of the Culex pipiens (L.) complex, Culex tarsalis Coquillett, and Culex stigmatosoma Dyar under field, seminatural, and experimental conditions. All Culex spp. remained vagile throughout winter, enabling the collection of 3,174 females and 1,706 males from diverse habitats during the winters of 2010-2012. Overwintering strategies included both quiescence and diapause. In addition, Cx. pipiens form molestus Forskal females remained reproductively active in both underground and aboveground habitats. Some blood-fed, gravid, and parous Cx. tarsalis and Cx. pipiens complex females were collected throughout the winter period. Under both field and experimental conditions, Cx. tarsalis and Cx. stigmatosoma females exposed to autumnal conditions arrested primary follicular maturation at previtellogenic stage I, with primary to secondary follicular ratios < 1.5 (indicative of a hormonally induced diapause). In contrast, most Cx. pipiens complex females did not enter reproductive diapause and ovarian follicles matured to >= stage I-II (host-seeking arrest) or were found in various stages of degeneration. Diapause was initiated in the majority of Cx. tarsalis and Cx. stigmatosoma females by mid-late October and was terminated after the winter solstice, but host-seeking seemed limited by temperature. An accrual of 97.52 +/- 30.7 and 162.85 +/- 79.3 degree-days after the winter solstice was estimated to be necessary for diapause termination in Cx. tarsalis under field and seminatural conditions, respectively. An increase in the proportion of blood-fed Culex females in resting collections occurred concurrently with diapause termination in field populations based on ovarian morphometrics. WNV RNA was detected in one pool of 18 males and in a single blood-fed female Cx. tarsalis collected during winter. Therefore, both vertically and horizontally infected Culex females may persist through winter and possibly transmit WNV after diapause termination in late winter or early spring in the Sacramento Valley of California.																	0022-2585	1938-2928				JUL	2013	50	4					773	790		10.1603/ME12280								WOS:000321897300013	23926775

Biology and Host Specificity of Anthonomus tenebrosus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae): A Herbivore of Tropical Soda Apple	ANNALS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												Tropical soda apple (Solanum viarum Dunal) is a major exotic weed in pastures and conservation areas in subtropical regions. Anthonomus tenebrosus Boheman (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) was found feeding on the flowers of tropical soda apple in southern Brazil and was considered a potential biological control agent. The objectives of this study were to examine the life history and host specificity of A. tenebrosus. The development from egg to adult was measured at eight constant temperatures in growth chambers. The presence of reproductive diapause was measured by using a two-way factorial design with three temperatures (20, 22.5, and 25 degrees C) and two photoperiods (14:10 and 10:14 [L:D] h). Temperature influenced the developmental time from egg to adult of A. tenebrosus, which ranged from 49.6 d at 16 degrees C to 13.6 d at 28 degrees C. The longevity of males ranged from 64 to 190 d, whereas females lived from 44 to 204 d. When exposed to 10:14 (L:D) h and 20 degrees C, 35% of females entered reproductive diapause. The fundamental host range of A. tenebrosus-based on several life-history aspects, including adult longevity, oogenesis, and oviposition-and immature development of A. tenebrosus were studied. Under no-choice conditions, approximate to 80% of adults survived for 30 d on several Solanum melongena L. varieties, Solanum capsicoides, S. viarum, and Solanum carolinense L. A. tenebrosus completed development from egg to adult on a number of S. melongena varieties, the native plant S. carolinense, and the exotic plants S. capsicoides All., S. viarum, and Solanum tampicense Dunal. Under paired-choice conditions, adult feeding occurred on all species, whereas oviposition occurred only on S. viarum, S. capsicoides, and S. carolinense. Because of the nontarget attack to S. melongena and a native plant, A. tenebrosus should not be considered for release as a biological control agent of tropical soda apple in the United States.																	0013-8746	1938-2901				JUL	2013	106	4					491	502		10.1603/AN13020								WOS:000321772700013

It rarely flowers but propagates from potato-like bulbils formed in leaf axils, which persist into the subsequent growing season. Lilioceris cheni Gressitt and Kimoto, a foliage-feeding beetle (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Criocerinae) from Nepal, had been tested, proven to be a specialist and approved for release as a biological control agent. Regulatory delays, however, resulted in the demise of quarantine-held colonies, and acquisition of new Nepalese stock proved untenable. Searches then undertaken in southern China resulted in the collection of over 300 similar beetles. Two Chinese Lilioceris species were identified: one confirmed to be L. cheni and the other identified as Lilioceris egena (Weise). Mitochondrial analysis revealed an exact DNA match between some Chinese and one of the two Nepalese c oxidase subunit I haplotypes and all Chinese L. cheni haplotypes clustered as a single species but the comingling of the two species aroused concerns over possible hybridisation. These concerns were allayed by nuclear D2 analysis showing the absence of dual parental sequences. Nonetheless, diligence was exercised to ensure that the Chinese strains were safe to release. Abridged host testing using critical test species verified specificity. Caged releases during autumn 2011 documented the ability of adult beetles to overwinter in south Florida despite a prolonged lack of foliage. Open releases the following year produced vigorous populations that caused extensive defoliation. Preliminary observations indicate that L. cheni now contributes to the control of D. bulbifera and the bulbil-feeding L. egena should complement these effects if its host range proves appropriate.

Spatial dichotomy of sociality in the African ice rat	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Sociality is environmentally and phylogenetically determined and can vary intraspecifically and interspecifically. We investigated the reasons for group living in the African ice rat Otomys sloggetti robertsi, a diurnal, herbivorous, non-hibernating murid rodent, endemic to the sub-alpine and alpine regions of the southern African Drakensberg and Maluti mountains. We expected ice rats to be group living, nesting communally in underground burrows. We documented the spatial organization and social behaviour of free-living ice rats through direct observations and experimental manipulations. Colonies comprised 4-17 adults of both sexes. Members of a colony had a high degree of spatial home-range overlap but no temporal overlap because interactions between members were rare aboveground. Individuals experimentally displaced within their own colony were attacked by members of their own colony and were treated in the same way as strangers from other colonies. Members of a colony competed aggressively for prized food, particularly in winter. Ice rats displayed a vertical spatial separation in social behaviour, from huddling and tolerance belowground to solitary foraging and mutual avoidance aboveground. Such a dichotomy in sociality reflects the compromise between the benefits of social thermoregulation and burrow sharing on the one hand and the constraints of competing for resources, mainly food, on the other. Such a compromise may ultimately be related to the poor physiological adaptation of ice rats to the cold environments they inhabit.

Three groups of newborn aspic vipers (Vipera aspis) were placed under contrasted thermal regimes during 7 months: (1) a cool 23 degrees C constant regime, (2) a warm 28 degrees C constant regime, and (3) an optimal regime with free-access to a wide range of temperatures. Later, all the snakes were placed under hibernation conditions (6 degrees C) during 3 months. Finally all the snakes were placed in the optimal thermal regime during 2 additional months. The total duration of the experiment was of 12 months. Body mass and feeding rates were recorded weekly, body size was measured monthly. We also assessed locomotor performance and recorded several behavioral traits (e.g., defensive and predatory behaviors). As expected, snakes raised under cool temperatures exhibited low feeding rate, growth rate, body condition, and they exhibited poor locomotor performance; they also displayed marked defensive behaviors (e.g., high number of defensive bites) whilst hesitating during longer periods to bite a prey. Such behavioral effects were detected at the end of the experiment (i.e., 5 months after exposure to contrasted thermal treatments [3 months of hibernation plus 2 months of optimal regime]), revealing long term effects. Surprisingly, growth rate and locomotor performance were not different between the two other groups, warm constant 28 degrees C versus optimal regimes (albeit several behavioral traits differed), suggesting that the access to a wide range of ambient temperatures was not a crucial factor.

Environmental Influences on Kelp Performance across the Reproductive Period: An Ecological Trade-Off between Gametophyte Survival and Growth?	PLOS ONE												Most kelps (order Laminariales) exhibit distinct temporal patterns in zoospore production, gametogenesis and gametophyte reproduction. Natural fluctuations in ambient environmental conditions influence the intrinsic characteristics of gametes, which define their ability to tolerate varied conditions. The aim of this work was to document seasonal patterns in reproduction and gametophyte growth and survival of Ecklonia radiata (C. Agardh) J. Agardh in south-western Australia. These results were related to patterns in local environmental conditions in an attempt to ascertain which factors explain variation throughout the season. E. radiata was fertile (produced zoospores) for three and a half months over summer and autumn. Every two weeks during this time, gametophytes were grown in a range of temperatures (16-22 degrees C) in the laboratory. Zoospore densities were highly variable among sample periods; however, zoospores released early in the season produced gametophytes which had greater rates of growth and survival, and these rates declined towards the end of the reproductive season. Growth rates of gametophytes were positively related to day length, with the fastest growing recruits released when the days were longest. Gametophytes consistently survived best in the lowest temperature (16 degrees C), yet exhibited optimum growth in higher culture temperatures (20-22 degrees C). These results suggest that E. radiata releases gametes when conditions are favourable for growth, and E. radiata gametophytes are tolerant of the range of temperatures observed at this location. E. radiata releases the healthiest gametophytes when day length and temperature conditions are optimal for better germination, growth, and sporophyte production, perhaps as a mechanism to help compete against other species for space and other resources.

EFFECT OF PHOTOPERIOD AND TEMPERATURE ON NYMPHAL DEVELOPMENT AND ADULT REPRODUCTION OF PIEZODORUS GUILDINII (HETEROPTERA: PENTATOMIDAE)	FLORIDA ENTOMOLOGIST												The effect of photoperiod and temperature on the biology of nymphs and adults of Piezodorus guildinii (Westwood) was studied in the laboratory. Four different conditions were tested (14:10, 12:12 and 10:14 h L:D at 25 degrees C, and 10:14 h L:D at 20 degrees C), at 80 +/- 10% RH. The shortest nymph development time was recorded at 14:10 h L:D (25 degrees C) (21.5 days) and the longest at 10:14 h L:D (20 degrees C) (42 days). The highest nymph mortality rate was recorded at 10:14 h L:D (20 degrees C) and the lowest at 14:10 h L:D (25 degrees C) (84.5 vs. 24.2%). Newly emerged females reared at 14:10 h L:D (25 degrees C) were heavier than those of the remaining treatments. Fresh body weight gain (mg) occurred only during the 1st week of adult life. Adult survivorship was highest at 10:14 h L:D (20 degrees C) and lowest at 14:10 h L:D (25 degrees C). Total longevity was shortest when adults were held at 14:10 h L:D (25 degrees C) and longest at 10:14 h L:D (20 degrees C) (38.6 vs. 98.8 days). The maximum percentage of ovipositing females occurred at 14:10 h L:D (25 degrees C) and the minimum at 10:14 h L:D (20 degrees C). Females maintained at 14:10 h L:D (25 degrees C) and 12:12 h L:D (25 degrees C) produced similar and greater number of egg masses than females at 10:14 h L:D (25 degrees C) and 10:14 h L:D (20 degrees C). The number of eggs/female was the greatest at 14:10 h L:D (25 degrees C) and the lowest at 10:14 h L:D (20 degrees C) (196.2 vs. 21.7 eggs/female). Egg viability was similar under different photophases at 25 degrees C, while significantly reduced at 10:14 h L:D (20 degrees C) (54 vs. 4.1%). The longest egg incubation period was recorded at 10:14 h L:D (20 degrees C) and the shortest at 14:10 h L:D (25 degrees C) (7 vs. 4.1 days). These laboratory results suggest that P. guildinii does not reproduce during the time its preferred host soybean is unavailable at latitude 30 degrees-35 degrees S, which corresponds approximately to the conditions tested at 10:14 h L:D (20 degrees C).																	0015-4040					JUN	2013	96	2					572	582		10.1653/024.096.0223								WOS:000320737200033

Day length, reproductive effort, and the avian latitudinal clutch size gradient	ECOLOGY												Explaining latitudinal patterns in life history traits remains a challenge for ecologists and evolutionary biologists. One such prominent pattern is the latitudinal gradient in clutch size in birds: the number of eggs laid in a reproductive bout increases with latitude in many species. One intuitive hypothesis proposes that the longer days at high latitudes during the breeding season allow parents to spend more time foraging each day, which results in greater total food delivery to the brood each day, and hence more offspring produced. This day length hypothesis is virtually untested, although it was proposed nearly 100 years ago. We developed a conceptual framework for distinguishing between the day length hypothesis and the widely accepted alternative hypothesis that attributes the latitudinal gradient in clutch size to increased per capita food resources at higher latitudes. Using this framework to contrast components of reproductive effort and life history patterns in a mid- and high-latitude Tree Swallow (Tachycineta bicolor) population provided clear evidence for the day length hypothesis, but little evidence for the alternative. Our findings suggest that the length of an animal's workday may be an important, but unappreciated, component of reproductive effort.

Because they presumably respond to similar evolutionary forces, it is tempting to consider that these strategies may substitute for each other. Yet in order to predict the outcome of the evolution of dispersal and dormancy, and to characterize the emerging covariation between both traits, it is necessary to consider models where dispersal and dormancy evolve jointly. Here, we analyze the evolution of dispersal and dormancy as a function of direct fitness costs, environmental variation, and competition among relatives. We consider two scenarios depending on whether the rates of dormancy for philopatric and dispersed individuals are constrained to be the same (unconditional dormancy) or allowed to be different (conditional dormancy). We show that only philopatric individuals should enter dormancy, at a rate increasing with increasing rates of local extinction and decreasing population sizes. When dormancy and dispersal evolve jointly, we observe a wide range of evolutionary outcomes. In particular, we find that the pattern of covariation between the evolutionarily stable rates of dispersal and dormancy is molded by the rate of extinction and the local population size.

J	Bonsignore, CP; Manti, F				Bonsignore, Carmelo Peter; Manti, Francesco			Influence of habitat and climate on the capture of male pine processionary moths	BULLETIN OF INSECTOLOGY												In the Aspromonte National Park (Calabria, Southern Italy), data were collected over 3 years on the flight of male pine processionary moths (PPM), as determined by pheromone traps, to determine the effect of habitat characteristics and climatic factors on male PPM flight. A variety of parameters, such as tree density, host tree species and the position of the traps, were investigated to analyze, their effect on PPM catches in relation to weekly minimum temperatures and accumulated precipitation. The characteristics of the forest stands had a variable effect on moth catches. The abundance of PPM males caught was related to host Pinus species and to the size of patches, with a noticeable positive effect of temperature and a negative effect of precipitation. The host Pinta nigra, particularly when associated with other host species, such as Pinus sylvestris and Pinus insignis, smaller sized patches and lower density forests, positively affected moth flight. Flying males were caught above a threshold of a mean weekly temperature of 14 C in combination with a photoperiod of >13.5 h of light with the flights in advance at higher altitudes. The relationship between the number of moths caught and nest density was evident in only 1 year, suggesting that the estimate of the population density based on the number of moths caught in the traps is possible only above a certain population density. A logistic model for all years is proposed to describe the relationships between the time scale and the cumulative percentage of flights.																	1721-8861					JUN	2013	66	1					27	34										WOS:000319310300006

Barbary macaques (Macaca sylvanus) are one of the few primates that live outside the tropics. Here we analyze if and how the activity budgets of Barbary macaques are affected by climatic variables, i.e., air temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, and snow coverage. We collected scan sampling data on the activity budgets of four groups of macaques living in the Middle Atlas Mountains of Morocco from June 2008 to January 2011. This habitat is characterized by extreme seasonal changes, from cold and snowy winters to hot and dry summers. The activity budgets of the macaques differed across months but not across the time of day (with the exception of time spent feeding). The monkeys spent significantly more time feeding or foraging when there was no snow than when snow coverage was moderate or major. Daily rainfall was positively related to resting time and negatively to time spent moving or in social behavior. Air temperature was negatively related to time spent feeding or foraging. Finally, time spent on social behavior was significantly lower when relative humidity was high. These data indicate that environmental factors significantly affect the time budgets of endangered Barbary macaques, a species that has been little studied in the wild. Our findings support previous studies on temperate primates in showing that snow coverage can have negative consequences on the feeding ecology and survival of these species.

What does it mean for the predator satiation hypothesis?	OECOLOGIA												The predator satiation hypothesis states that synchronous periodic production of seeds is an adaptive strategy evolved to reduce the pressure of seed predators. The seed production pattern is crucial to the predator satiation hypothesis, but there are few studies documenting the success of individuals that are in synchrony and out of synchrony with the whole population. This study is based on long-term data on seed production of Sorbus aucuparia and specialised pre-dispersal seed predation by Argyresthia conjugella, in a subalpine spruce forest in the Western Carpathians (Poland). At the population level, we tested whether functional and numerical responses of predators to the variation of fruit production operate. At the individual level, we tested whether individuals with higher interannual variability in their own seed crops and higher synchrony with the population have higher percentages of uninfested fruits. The intensity of pre-dispersal seed predation was high (average 70 %; range 19-100 %). There were both functional and numerical responses of predators to the variation of fruit production at the population level. We found that individuals that were expected to be preferred under seed predator pressure had higher reproductive success. With increasing synchrony of fruit production between individual trees and the population, the percentage of infested fruits decreased. There was also a negative relationship between the interannual variation in individual fruit production and the percentage of infested fruits. These results confirm selection for individuals with a masting strategy. However, the population does not seem well adapted to strong seed predation pressure and we suggest that this may be a result of prolonged diapause of A. conjugella.																	0029-8549					JUN	2013	172	2					461	467		10.1007/s00442-012-2502-x								WOS:000319077100015	23080304

As a result of geographical variations in photoperiodic response, the moths from Nanchang (28.8 degrees N, 115.9 degrees E; NC strain) judge both LD 14:10h and LD 15:9h photocycles as long days and develop directly, whereas moths from Haerbin (44.9 degrees N, 127.2 degrees E; HB strain) judge the same photocycles as short days and enter diapause. Crosses between the two strains are used to evaluate the inheritance of diapause. The critical day lengths for diapause induction in the HB strain are significantly longer than those in the NC strain at all temperatures. The critical day length of F1 progeny is intermediate between the two strains. However, the critical day length in all crosses is significantly longer with HB strain fathers or grandfathers than with NC strain fathers or grandfathers, indicating that the male parent has significantly more influence on the critical day length of subsequent progeny than the female. The results from all crosses under LD 14:10h or LD 15:9h photocycles at 25 degrees C show that the inheritance of diapause in O. furnacalis does not fit a purely additive hypothesis and that the capacity for diapause is transmitted genetically in the manner of incomplete dominance. The incidence of diapause for F1 progeny under an LD 14:10h photocycle is significantly higher than that under an LD 15:9h photocycle, suggesting that the induction of diapause can be influenced by interactions between the F1 genotype and photoperiod.																	0307-6962					JUN	2013	38	2					126	132		10.1111/phen.12009								WOS:000319320600005

Transcriptome sequencing as a platform to elucidate molecular components of the diapause response in the Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus	PHYSIOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												Diapause has long been recognized as a crucial ecological adaptation to spatio-temporal environmental variation. More recently, rapid evolution of the diapause response has been implicated in response to contemporary global warming and during the range expansion of invasive species. Although the molecular regulation of diapause remains largely unresolved, rapidly emerging next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies provide exciting opportunities for addressing this longstanding question. In the present study, a new assembly from life-history stages relevant to diapause in the Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus (Skuse) is reported, along with unique methods for the analysis of NGS data and transcriptome assembly. A digital normalization procedure that significantly reduces the computational resources required for transcriptome assembly is evaluated. Additionally, a method for protein reference-based and genomic reference-based merged assembly of 454 and Illumina reads is described. Finally, a gene ontology analysis is presented, which creates a platform for identifying the physiological processes associated with diapause. Taken together, these methods provide valuable tools for analyzing the transcriptional underpinnings of many complex phenotypes, including diapause, and provide a basis for determining the molecular regulation of diapause in Ae. albopictus.

Temperature modulation of photoperiodism: an adaptation for long-distance dispersal in the aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum (Hemiptera: Aphididae)	CANADIAN ENTOMOLOGIST												Variation in the seasonal occurrence of asexual and sexual phenotypes of Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) is quantified for a local population in southern Manitoba, Canada. To survive winter, summer asexual generations must produce a sexual generation in a timely way at the end of the season, so that females can lay overwintering eggs. This transition is controlled by day length, which varies in a fixed seasonal pattern with latitude, and the local pattern of day length selects for an appropriate photoperiodic response. Substantial variation in the timing of production of males and mating females occurs among locally collected genotypes. Some of the variation is due to the arrival of long-distance dispersers (1000 km or more), and some is consistent with shorter but still long-distance dispersal. Some of the variation is due to year-to-year changes in late summer temperature. The critical day length in nature, which corresponds to critical photoperiod, increases as the average temperature decreases. This temperature modulation is adaptive because it allows many genotypes to produce some sexual phenotypes before the end of the season, although their photoperiodic responses are characteristic of long-distance dispersers and inappropriate to local day lengths.																	0008-347X					JUN	2013	145	3					302	316		10.4039/tce.2012.97								WOS:000318908400007

Diel Vertical Migration in Deep Sea Plankton Is Finely Tuned to Latitudinal and Seasonal Day Length	PLOS ONE												Diel vertical migration (DVM) is a ubiquitous phenomenon in marine and freshwater plankton communities. Most commonly, plankton migrate to surface waters at dusk and return to deeper waters at dawn. Up until recently, it was thought that DVM was triggered by a relative change in visible light intensity. However, evidence has shown that DVM also occurs in the deep sea where no direct and background sunlight penetrates. To identify whether such DVM is associated with latitudinal and seasonal day light variation, one and a half years of recorded acoustic data, a measure of zooplankton abundance and movement, were examined. Acoustic Doppler current profilers, moored at eight different sub-tropical latitudes in the North-Atlantic Ocean, measured in the vertical range of 500-1600 m. DVM was observed to follow day length variation with a change in season and latitude at all depths. DVM followed the rhythm of local sunrise and sunset precisely between 500 and 650 m. It continued below 650 m, where the deepest penetrable irradiance level are <10(-7) times their near-surface values, but plankton shortened their time at depth by up to about 63% at 1600 m. This suggests light was no longer a cue for DVM. This trend stayed consistent both across latitudes and between the different seasons. It is hypothesized that another mechanism, rather than light, viz. a precise biochemical clock could maintain the solar diurnal and seasonal rhythms in deep sea plankton motions. In accordance with this hypothesis, the deepest plankton were consistently the first to migrate upwards.																	1932-6203					MAY 22	2013	8	5							e64435	10.1371/journal.pone.0064435								WOS:000320362700147	23717613

Deep sequencing reveals complex mechanisms of diapause preparation in the invasive mosquito, Aedes albopictus	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Seasonal environments present fundamental physiological challenges to a wide range of insects. Many temperate insects surmount the exigencies of winter by undergoing photoperiodic diapause, in which photoperiod provides a token cue that initiates an alternative developmental programme leading to dormancy. Pre-diapause is a crucial preparatory phase of this process, preceding developmental arrest. However, the regulatory and physiological mechanisms of diapause preparation are largely unknown. Using high-throughput gene expression profiling in the Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, we reveal major shifts in endocrine signalling, cell proliferation, metabolism, energy production and cellular structure across pre-diapause development. While some hallmarks of diapause, such as insulin signalling and stress response, were not important at the transcriptional level, two genes, Pepck and PCNA, appear to show diapause-induced transcriptional changes across insect taxa. These processes demonstrate physiological commonalities between Ae. albopictus pre-diapause and diapause strategies across insects, and support the idea of a genetic 'toolkit' for diapause. Observations of gene expression trends from a comparative developmental perspective suggest that individual physiological processes are delayed against a background of a fixed morphological ontogeny. Our results demonstrate how deep sequencing can provide new insights into elusive molecular bases of complex ecological adaptations.

We describe the generation and validation of a compendium of assays to quantify 97% of the 4,012 annotated Mtb proteins by the targeted mass spectrometric method selected reaction monitoring (SRM). Furthermore, we estimate the absolute abundance for 55% of all Mtb proteins, revealing a dynamic range within the Mtb proteome of over four orders of magnitude, and identify previously un-annotated proteins. As an example of the assay library utility, we monitored the entire Mtb dormancy survival regulon (DosR), which is linked to anaerobic survival and Mtb persistence, and show its dynamic protein-level regulation during hypoxia. In conclusion, we present a publicly available research resource that supports the sensitive, precise, and reproducible quantification of virtually any Mtb protein by a robust and widely accessible mass spectrometric method.

J	Mohandes, MA; Rehman, S				Mohandes, Mohamed A.; Rehman, Shafiqur			Estimation of sunshine duration in Saudi Arabia	JOURNAL OF RENEWABLE AND SUSTAINABLE ENERGY												In this paper we propose machine learning algorithms to estimate the sunshine duration at any region in Saudi Arabia using easily obtained parameters that include: maximum possible day length (So), extraterrestrial solar radiation at that particular location (Ho), latitude, longitude, altitude, and month number. Two neural network algorithms, namely, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm and Support Vector Machine (SVM), are used to estimate the sunshine duration (S). Due to the limited number of measurement stations, we use the leave-one-out strategy, where data from 40 measurement stations are used to build the model and data from the remaining 41st station are utilized to assess accuracy of the modeled system. This process is repeated for each of the 41 stations. Minimum mean absolute percent errors (MAPE) of 2.3% and 2.7% were obtained at Al-Madina station using PSO and SVM methods while the respective maximum values of 22.9% and 16.7% were observed at Al-Numas station. In general, higher MAPE values were found during summer time (June-August) and lower in winter time (January-February and November-December). Results indicate the viability of the proposed methods for estimating sunshine duration in Saudi Arabia, and the system is expected to perform similarly in other countries with similar environment.

Reproductive costs for everyone: How female loads impact human mobility strategies	JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION												While mobility strategies are considered important in understanding selection pressures on individuals, testing hypotheses of such strategies requires high resolution datasets, particularly at intersections between morphology, ecology and energetics. Here we present data on interactions between morphology and energetics in regards to the cost of walking for reproductive women and place these data into a specific ecological context of time and heat load. Frontal loads (up to 16% of body mass), as during pregnancy and child-carrying, significantly slow the optimal and preferred walking speed of women, significantly increase cost at the optimal speed, and make it significantly more costly for women to walk with other people. We further show for the first time significant changes in the curvature in the Cost of Transport curve for human walking, as driven by frontal loads. The impact of these frontal loads on females, and the populations to which they belong, would have been magnified by time constraints due to seasonal changes in day length at high latitudes and thermoregulatory limitations at low latitudes. However, wider pelves increase both stride length and speed flexibility, providing a morphological offset for load-related costs. Longer lower limbs also increase stride length. Observed differences between preferred and energetically optimal speeds with frontal loading suggest that speed choices of women carrying reproductive loads might be particularly sensitive to changes in heat load. Our findings show that female reproductive costs, particularly those related to locomotion, would have meaningfully shaped the mobility strategies of the hominin lineage, as well as modern foraging populations.

VARIATION IN PRIMARY MOLT IN THE LEAST AUKLET	CONDOR												Along with breeding and migration, molt is one of the most energetically expensive components of a bird's annual cycle. Auklets (tribe Aethiini) are apparently unique among the Alcidae in that flight-feather molt and breeding overlap. We compared the degree of overlap of primary molt with breeding in the Least Auklet (Aethia pusilla) at four colonies in varying oceanographic environments: Kiska Island (Aleutian Islands, Alaska, 52 degrees N), St. George Island (Pribilof Islands, Alaska, 56 degrees N), St. Paul Island (Pribilof Islands, 57 degrees N), and Cape Ulyakhpen (Chukotka Peninsula, Russia, 64 degrees N). We hypothesized that the onset and speed of feather replacement should be related to latitude or sea-ice dynamics. Flight-feather molt commenced during incubation with up to four primaries replaced by the end of chick rearing. At Kiska, we found no difference in molt rate between adult breeders and nonbreeders, but subadults started molt after adults and were more variable in when they started primary molt. At higher latitudes adult anklets replaced their first four primaries faster and initiated molt later although the length of the breeding season was similar. The increased energetic requirements of Least Auklets breeding and molting at higher latitudes are supported by the cold Anadyr Current, which advects lipid-rich oceanic copepods (Neocalanus spp.). In the Least Auklet and other members of the Aethiini, sequential primary molt, rather than the simultaneous molt typical of other alcids, may be possible because of anklets' lower body mass, lower wing loading, mass loss at hatching, and foraging on highly abundant prey.

As it is a competent vector for several arboviruses, its spread is of increasing public health concern, and there is a need for appropriate monitoring tools. In this paper, we have developed a modelling approach to predict mosquito abundance over time, and identify the main determinants of mosquito population dynamics. The model is temperature-and rainfall-driven, takes into account egg diapause during unfavourable periods, and was used to model the population dynamics of Ae. albopictus in the French Riviera since 2008. Entomological collections of egg stage from six locations in Nice conurbation were used for model validation. We performed a sensitivity analysis to identify the key parameters of the mosquito population dynamics. Results showed that the model correctly predicted entomological field data (Pearson r correlation coefficient values range from 0.73 to 0.93). The model's main control points were related to adult's mortality rates, the carrying capacity in pupae of the environment, and the beginning of the unfavourable period. The proposed model can be efficiently used as a tool to predict Ae. albopictus population dynamics, and to assess the efficiency of different control strategies.

The evolutionary time machine: using dormant propagules to forecast how populations can adapt to changing environments	TRENDS IN ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION												Evolutionary changes are determined by a complex assortment of ecological, demographic, and adaptive histories. Predicting how evolution will shape the genetic structures of populations coping with current (and future) environmental challenges has principally relied on investigations through space, in lieu of time, because long-term phenotypic and molecular data are scarce. Yet, dormant propagules in sediments, soils, and permafrost are convenient natural archives of population histories from which to trace adaptive trajectories along extended time periods. DNA sequence data obtained from these natural archives, combined with pioneering methods for analyzing both ecological and population genomic time-series data, are likely to provide predictive models to forecast evolutionary responses of natural populations to environmental changes resulting from natural and anthropogenic stressors, including climate change.

Environmental control of seasonal reproduction in the wild and captive Eurasian Tree Sparrow (Passer montanus) with respect to variations in gonadal mass, histology, and sex steroids	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												The present study was undertaken on both sexes of the subtropical Eurasian Tree Sparrow (Passer montanus (L., 1758)) to investigate seasonal cycles of gonadal mass, histology, and hormones in relation to various environmental factors at Shillong, India. Attempts were also made to examine whether seasonal responses differ under wild and captivity and also between the sexes. Finally, reproductive seasonality of the sparrow under subtropical conditions was compared with the patterns found elsewhere in its distribution. Both sexes of the Tree Sparrow possess annual cycles of gonadal mass, histology, and steroids that follow the annual solar cycle. Increasing day length during spring stimulates gonadal growth with a corresponding increase in gonadal steroids followed by spontaneous gonadal regression leading to steroidal decline and photorefractoriness. Histomorphometric analyses of gonads revealed seasonal variations in the thickness of germinative epithelium and testicular wall, diameters of seminiferous tubules, and area of intertubular space in the males, and in the thickness of follicle wall and ratio of various follicles in the females. Although males responded in a similar fashion under wild and captivity, the responses of females deferred significantly. Thus, the Tree Sparrow exhibited sexual responses almost similar to their conspecifics at other latitudes.																	0008-4301	1480-3283				MAY	2013	91	5					302	312		10.1139/cjz-2012-0190								WOS:000318784900006

This constancy of location leads to the hypothesis that semiochemicals are involved in the attraction and aggregation of ladybirds to the microsite. In this study, we identified two types of semiochemicals that could play key roles in the attraction and aggregation formation of the two-spotted ladybird, Adalia bipunctata. We first isolated and identified three alkylmethoxypyrazines from A. bipunctata and tested the behavioral responses of diapausing ladybirds to these chemicals in a four-way olfactometer. This revealed that 2-isobutyl-3-methoxypyrazine, on its own or as part of a two-component mixture with 2-isopropyl-3-methoxypyrazine, elicited a positive behavioral response, causing arrestment of diapausing A. bipunctata. As ladybirds are in contact with each other in aggregations, we investigated the role of cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) in driving the cohesion and maintenance of aggregation. When an extract of CHCs from diapausing ladybirds was deposited near an alkylmethoxypyrazine source, ladybirds spent more time in the vicinity of the source. We identified a set of CHCs specific to diapausing A. bipunctata. Alkylmethoxyyrazines and CHCs thus deliver information to diapausing ladybirds searching for an aggregation site, as well as mediating several other behaviors throughout the ladybird's life cycle. Chemical parsimony is discussed.

Inferring local processes from macro-scale phenological pattern: a comparison of two methods	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Understanding the processes responsible for macro-scale spatial and temporal phenological patterns is a critical step in developing predictive phenological models. While phenological responses may involve the integration of multiple environmental cues, the spring phenology of many plant and animal species appears to be especially sensitive to temperature. As a result of the success of citizen science schemes in mobilizing amateur naturalists, for some parts of the world, there now exist extensive data sets of phenological timings, spanning many species, locations and years. In macroecology, two types of models time windows and growing degree-days are widely used to predict phenology on the basis of temperature. Here, we compare the performance of the two methods in predicting spatiotemporal variation in the timing of Quercus robur first leafing. The methods agree on the time at which leafing becomes sensitive to temperature and provide weak support for a delay in initiation of thermal sensitivity with increasing latitude due to a day-length requirement. Both methods explain c. 50% of the variation in first dates and identify plasticity, rather than local adaptation, as the major cause of spatial covariation between temperature and phenology. For a 1 degrees C rise in spring temperatures we predict that a plastic response of first leafing will give rise to an advance of about seven days. Synthesis: Time-window and growing degree-day methods provide remarkably congruent insights into the processes underpinning geographic variation in Quercus robur first leafing dates. We find that a spatially invariant plastic response to temperature dominates spatiotemporal phenological variation, which means that it may be reasonable to substitute space for time to project how this species will respond to climate change. This study demonstrates the contribution that top-down macroecological approaches can make to our understanding of the processes that give rise to intraspecific phenological variation.

Flow intermittency alters longitudinal patterns of invertebrate diversity and assemblage composition in an arid-land stream network	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Temporary streams comprise a large proportion of the total length of most stream networks, and the great majority of arid-land stream networks, so it is important to understand their contribution to biotic diversity at both local and landscape scales. 2. In late winter 2010, we sampled invertebrate assemblages in 12 reaches of a large arid-land stream network (including perennial and intermittent headwaters, intermittent middle reaches and perennial rivers) in south-east Arizona, U.S.A. Intermittent reaches had then been flowing for c.60days, following a dry period of more than 450days. We sampled a subset of the perennial study reaches three more times between 2009 and 2011. Since intermittent reaches were dry during these additional sampling periods, we used assemblage data from two other intermittent streams in the study network (sampled in 200405 and 2010) to explore interannual variability in intermittent stream assemblage composition. 3. Invertebrate richness was lowest in intermittent reaches, despite their often being connected to species-rich perennial reaches. The assemblages of these intermittent reaches were not simply a subset of the species in perennial streams, but rather were dominated by a suite of stoneflies, blackflies and midges with adaptations to intermittency (e.g. egg and/or larval diapause). On average, 86% of individuals in these samples were specialists or exclusive to intermittent streams. Predators were 714 times more abundant in perennial than in intermittent reaches. 4. Despite being separated by long distances (1225km) and having very different physical characteristics, the assemblages of perennial headwaters and rivers were more similar to one another than to intervening intermittent reaches, emphasising the prime importance of local hydrology in this system. 5. The duration and recurrence intervals of dry periods, and the relative importance of dispersal from perennial refuges, probably influence the magnitude of biological differences between neighbouring perennial and temporary streams. Although perennial headwaters supported the highest diversity of invertebrates, intermittent reaches supported a number of unique or locally rare species and as such contribute to regional species diversity and should be included in conservation planning.																	0046-5070	1365-2427				MAY	2013	58	5					1016	1028		10.1111/fwb.12105								WOS:000317625900014

In our study, spatial analysis using radio-tracking data from Finland showed that sex and season had significant effects on the home-range size of hedgehogs. Although males were heavier than females, body weight had no effect on home-range size. Total home ranges (male 98, female 55 ha) were larger than those in southern areas. Thus, male home ranges were larger than those of females during the mating (male 72, female 21 ha) and post-mating seasons (male 48, female 20 ha), but the differences were small and reversed before hibernation (male 17, female 29 ha). Home ranges of individuals of both sexes overlapped, but females shared core areas with other females only during the mating season. Our results imply possible differences in hedgehog ecology probably due to a less productive and harsh northern habitat.																	0003-455X	1797-2450				APR 12	2013	50	1-2					107	123		10.5735/086.050.0110								WOS:000317443700010

SPATIAL ECOLOGY OF PRAIRIE RATTLESNAKES (CROTALUS VIRIDIS) ASSOCIATED WITH BLACK-TAILED PRAIRIE DOG (CYNOMYS LUDOVICIANUS) COLONIES IN COLORADO	HERPETOLOGICAL CONSERVATION AND BIOLOGY												We analyzed movements of three groups of radio-telemetered Prairie Rattlesnakes (Crotalus viridis) hibernating in three Black-tailed Prairie Dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) colonies within short-grass prairie in Arapahoe County, Colorado. Movements were short and frequent, with mean R values (measuring straightness-of-path) not exceeding 0.6. Mean total distance traveled during the entire active season was 3007 m. On average, snakes moved 0.7 times per day, traveling 89 m per movement. Home range sizes varied from 0.3-31.4 ha. All snakes returned in autumn to the same colony in which they hibernated the previous winter. Increased foraging opportunities in our study site may have supported shorter migrations than have been reported for C. viridis in Wyoming. Greater body mass of our rattlesnakes and a Nebraska population of C. viridis relative to a Wyoming population of C. viridis indirectly supports this idea. We discuss conservation implications of these findings.																	2151-0733	1931-7603				APR	2013	8	1					240	250										WOS:000327352400022

However, the extent, causes, and pattern of variability in consumer stoichiometry across a large geographical scale are not well understood. Here, we investigated this issue using a holometabolous insect, weevils (Curculio davidi Fairmaire). Larvae of this species store energy needed for diapause, and variable energy requirements across the geographic range of this species could lead to differences in body elemental composition. Our results showed that variability was high (assessed as the coefficient of variation (CV)) in larval body nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) (CV, 10% for N and 13% for P) compared to emerging adults (CV, 5% for N and 8% for P). Temperature-related factors explained more variation than other climatic factors and food for carbon (C), N and P in weevil. In warmer regions, larval C concentration was higher, while N and P were lower. The high C content of weevil larvae relative to both their food source and their adult stage was attributed to energy storage. Across the climatic gradient of its geographic range, larval body C content increased with mean annual temperature and decreased with average diurnal temperature range. This finding implies that temperature-related C storage drives the high variability in elemental composition of larvae across the climate gradient, and also effectively dampens the stoichiometric imbalance between consumers and food resources while serving as an energy reservoir for overwintering and metamorphosis.

In this species, diapause occurs in the larval stage and is maternally induced. Adult Nasonia females were exposed to different photoperiodic cycles and lifetime production of diapausing offspring was scored. Females switched to the production of diapausing offspring after exposure to a threshold number of photoperiodic cycles. A latitudinal cline was found in the proportion of diapausing offspring, the switch point for diapause induction measured as the maternal age at which the female starts to produce diapausing larvae, and the critical photoperiod for diapause induction. Populations at northern latitudes show an earlier switch point, higher proportions of diapausing individuals and longer critical photoperiods. Since the photoperiodic response was measured under the same laboratory conditions, the observed differences between populations most likely reflect genetic differences in sensitivity to photoperiodic cues, resulting from local adaptation to environmental cycles. The observed variability in diapause response combined with the availability of genomic tools for N. vitripennis represent a good opportunity to further investigate the genetic basis of this adaptive trait.																	1010-061X					APR	2013	26	4					705	718		10.1111/jeb.12113								WOS:000317432700003	23496837					
J	Masciocchi, M; Corley, J				Masciocchi, Maite; Corley, Juan			Distribution, dispersal and spread of the invasive social wasp (Vespula germanica) in Argentina	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												We studied the distribution and spread of the invasive social wasp Vespula germanica in Argentina, focusing on the contribution of queen dispersal to territorial expansion. Vespula germanica is native to Eurasia and has invaded several regions of the world, including Southern Argentina. Flight potential of field-collected queens was measured using flight mills. Also, by means of an extensive survey we estimated the rate of spread by analysing the relationship between years since arrival and distance from the introduction locality. The mean distance flown by wasp queens in flight mills was 404.7 +/- 140.8m (mean +/- SE, n=59), while the rate of spread of V.germanica was estimated at 37.2 +/- 2.1kmyear1 (mean +/- SE, n=67), although faster towards the south. The observed spread rate of V.germanica wasps in Argentina confirms the invasive potential shown by several Hymenoptera species worldwide. Still, a stratified geographical expansion pattern does not match observed queen dispersal abilities, suggesting that human-aided transport of hibernating queens is the central driver of the current distribution of these wasps. We suggest that despite several life-history traits known for social insects that contribute to successful invasion, wasp spread must still rely strongly on human mediated pathways. This observation sheds light on those factors that are crucial for managing invasions of this and related pestiferous wasps.

Thermal responses to feeding in a secretive and specialized predator (Gila monster, Heloderma suspectum)	JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY												We investigate how a unique dietary specialist, the Gila monster (Heloderma suspectum), uses behavioral thermoregulation to elevate body temperature (T-b) after feeding. Lizards in a laboratory thermal gradient were fed rodent meals of three different sizes (5, 10, or 20% of body mass), or sham fed (meal of 0% body mass), and T(b)s were recorded for three days before feeding and seven days after feeding. Gila monsters selected a mean T-b of 25.2 degrees C while fasting (set-point range 23.6-27.1), and increased T(b)s after feeding. The magnitude and duration of post-prandial T-b increases are positively related to meal size, and Gila monsters selected mean T(b)s up to 3.0 degrees C higher and maintain elevated T(b)s for 3-6 days after feeding. Selection of T-b does not appear to differ between day and night time periods, and because the lizards are both diurnal and nocturnal (at different times of year), photoperiod may not be an important influence on T-b selection.

Exposure of larvae reared under short-day conditions to long days induced a clear phase delay of the circannual rhythm. There was no notable difference in the initial phase or period of the circannual rhythm among four geographically distinct populations of A. verbasci in Japan: Takanabe (32.1 degrees N), Osaka (34.7 degrees N), Sendai (38.3 degrees N), and Sapporo (43.1 degrees N) populations. The range of photoperiodic changes effective for phase delay in the circannual pupation rhythm was compared among the four populations. Although larvae did not show a typical threshold response, but responded quantitatively to the photophase duration in intermediate conditions, the critical daylengths were calculated as those under which the pupation was delayed by 50%: 12.8 h in the Takanabe population, 13.2 h in the Osaka population, and 13.6 h in the Sendai and Sapporo populations. Thus, the critical daylength for entrainment of the circannual rhythm in A. verbasci was correlated to the habitat latitude, but the differences among the populations were much smaller than those reported in photoperiodism for induction of diapause in various insects. Consequently, the difference in the pupation time among the four geographic populations was very small under the natural photoperiod in Osaka at 20 degrees C, and absent under the natural photoperiod and temperature in Osaka. These results suggest that A. verbasci survives and successfully produces the next generation in different geographic regions without changing the parameters of the circannual rhythm.

J	Burns, CW				Burns, Carolyn W.			Predictors of invasion success by Daphnia species: influence of food, temperature and species identity	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Non-indigenous North American Daphnia 'pulex' has recently invaded lakes and reservoirs in South Island, New Zealand, that formerly contained only native Daphnia carinata. New Zealand is characterised by a wide range of freshwater ecosystems and low species diversity of planktonic crustaceans, particularly Cladocera. The potential success of a species to invade and establish in a new community is likely to be predicted more accurately when reproductive response norms and fitness of key resident species, as well as the non-indigenous species, have been established under a range of relevant environmental conditions. Based on the results of experiments to test aspects of reproduction and fitness of the invader, D. 'pulex', and D. carinata when grown together at a range of relevant temperatures (8-23 A degrees C) and related photoperiods, I predict the species-specific potential of D. 'pulex' to be dispersed and colonise New Zealand lentic habitats, and the potential of D. carinata to persist with the invader in these habitats. Larger population densities of D. 'pulex' compared to D. carinata at higher temperatures and food level, and larger densities of D. carinata at low temperatures, imply a potential for both species to coexist in New Zealand lakes, facilitated by seasonal succession; increased water temperature and nutrient input associated with climate and land use changes appear likely to promote the wider establishment of D. 'pulex', with both negative and positive implications for the conservation and management of New Zealand's freshwater ecosystems.																	1387-3547	1573-1464				APR	2013	15	4					859	869		10.1007/s10530-012-0335-5								WOS:000316200700013

The larval, nymphal and adult ticks were fed on sheep at 25-27 A degrees C, 50 % relative humidity (RH) and exposed to daylight. All free-living stages were maintained in an incubator (28 A degrees C with 90 % RH and a 12-h photoperiod). The whole life cycle of H. qinghaiensis was completed in an average of 176 days (range 118-247 days). The average developmental periods were 34.44 days for egg incubation; 5.83, 4.20 and 33.70 days for larval pre-feeding, feeding and pre-molting; and 3.88, 5.30 and 46.50 days for nymphal pre-feeding, feeding and pre-molting. The average times for pre-feeding, feeding, pre-oviposition and oviposition of female adult ticks were 2.60, 11.40, 8.50, and 19.35 days, respectively. The results confirmed the positive correlation between the weight of the engorged female and the egg mass laid (r = 0.557, P < 0.05). The reproductive efficiency index and reproductive fitness index in females were 5.49 and 4.98, respectively. Engorged nymphs moulting to females (4.53 +/- A 0.16 mg) were significantly heavier (P < 0.001) than those moulting to males (3.45 +/- A 0.19 mg). The overall sex ratio of the adult ticks was 1:1.1 (M:F).																	0168-8162	1572-9702				APR	2013	59	4					493	500		10.1007/s10493-012-9617-y								WOS:000315603000010	23111808

Phenological models driven by climate data can be used for assessing the potential distribution and voltinism of different insect species, but the quality of the simulations is influenced by a range of uncertainties. In this study, we model the temperature-dependent activity and development of the Colorado potato beetle, and analyse the influence of uncertainty associated with parameterization of temperature and day length response. We found that the developmental threshold has a major impact on the simulated number of generations per year. Little is known about local adaptations and individual variations, but the use of an upper and a lower developmental threshold gave an indication on the potential variation. The day length conditions triggering diapause are known only for a few populations. We used gridded observed temperature data to estimate local adaptations, hypothesizing that cold autumns can leave a footprint in the population genetics by low survival of individuals not reaching the adult stage before winter. Our study indicated that the potential selection pressure caused by climate conditions varies between European regions. Provided that there is enough genetic variation, a local adaption at the northern distribution limit would reduce the number of unsuccessful initiations and thereby increase the potential for spreading to areas currently not infested. The simulations of the impact model were highly sensitive to biases in climate model data, i.e. systematic deviations in comparison with observed weather, highlightening the need of improved performance of regional climate models. Even a moderate temperature increase could change the voltinism of Leptinotarsa decemlineata in Europe, but knowledge on agricultural practice and strategies for countermeasures is needed to evaluate changes in risk of attacks.

Naturally occurring allele diversity allows potato cultivation in northern latitudes	NATURE												Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) originates from the Andes and evolved short-day-dependent tuber formation as a vegetative propagation strategy. Here we describe the identification of a central regulator underlying a major-effect quantitative trait locus for plant maturity and initiation of tuber development. We show that this gene belongs to the family of DOF (DNA-binding with one finger) transcription factors' and regulates tuberization and plant life cycle length, by acting as a mediator between the circadian clock and the StSP6A mobile tuberization signal(2). We also show that natural allelic variants evade post-translational light regulation, allowing cultivation outside the geographical centre of origin of potato. Potato is a member of the Solanaceae family and is one of the world's most important food crops. This annual plant originates from the Andean regions of South America(3). Potato develops tubers from underground stems called stolons. Its equatorial origin makes potato essentially short-day dependent for tuberization and potato will not make tubers in the long-day conditions of spring and summer in the northern latitudes. When introduced in temperate zones, wild material will form tubers in the course of the autumnal shortening of day-length. Thus, one of the first selected traits in potato leading to a European potato type(4) is likely to have been long-day acclimation for tuberization. Potato breeders can exploit the naturally occurring variation in tuberization onset and life cycle length, allowing varietal breeding for different latitudes, harvest times and markets.

Paul			Seed availability and timing of breeding of Common Crossbills Loxia curvirostra at Sitka Spruce Picea sitchensis dominated forestry plantations	ARDEA												In Britain the Common Crossbill Loxia curvirostra population has increased markedly in abundance and range with the maturing of the post-war forestry plantations. However, little published information exists on the breeding ecology of the species in these plantations. Crossbills were more abundant in years of high Sitka Spruce Picea sitchensis cone production in the upland forestry plantations of South Wales. The breeding season began early in the year with a median laying date of 13 February and declined after this peak with few nests initiated after April, when the availability of Sitka Spruce seeds declined. The modal clutch size was 3 eggs and an estimated 35% of nests produced fledged young. Most nest failures were associated with adverse weather. Our observations indicate ephemeral occupancy of Sitka Spruce forests as a consequence of variable seed availability, a peak in breeding activity determined by photoperiod and food supply and a low level of breeding productivity.																	0373-2266					SPR	2013	101	1					33	38		10.5253/078.101.0104								WOS:000320894100005

EFFECT OF INSECT DENSITY AND HOST PLANT QUALITY ON WING-FORM IN MEGAMELUS SCUTELLARIS (HEMIPTERA: DELPHACIDAE)	FLORIDA ENTOMOLOGIST												Megamelus scutellaris Berg (Hemiptera: Delphacidae) is a South American species that feeds on waterhyacinth, Eichhornia crassipes Mart. (Solms). This species exhibits significant wing dimorphism whereby fully winged adults (macropters) are capable of flight while those with reduced wings (brachtypters) are not. The wing form is determined by a developmental switch triggered by environmental factors including crowding, host plant quality, temperature, and photoperiod. This study examined the influences of insect density and host plant quality on M. scutellaris wing dimorphism, development, and biomass as well as their effects on E. crassipes. Two experiments exposed a single generation of M. scutellaris to lower and higher densities of conspecifics on low and high quality plants. The first experiment involved transferring second instars to test plants at loads of 50, 5, or 1 g of fresh weight plant biomass per nymph, which resulted in mean densities of 2, 15, and 69 nymphs, respectively, on both low and high quality plants. A second experiment exposed test plants to 2, 4, or 20 M. scutellaris adults for 7 days and allowed their progeny to develop into adults which ultimately produced densities of 0, 56, and 352 F-1 adults, respectively, per low and high quality plants. No macropterous adults were produced in any treatment combination in either experiment. Several plant variables were affected by insect densities and plant quality including the mean relative growth rate, the change in leaf number, and the percentage of dead leaves on a plant. Megamelus scutellaris appeared to have a relatively high density threshold for macroptery within the range of host quality used in these studies. This may promote more brachyptery which, in turn, may increase the chances of this insect reaching damaging densities in field populations of E. crassipes.																	0015-4040					MAR	2013	96	1					124	130		10.1653/024.096.0116								WOS:000317379200016

Controls over reproductive phenology among ungulates: allometry and tropical-temperate contrasts	ECOGRAPHY												Ungulates inhabiting high latitudes schedule the timing of conceptions so that offspring are born during the most favourable nutritional conditions for reproductive success. The optimal period for births is less reliably predictable in tropical and subtropical savanna environments where plant growth is governed by rainfall, suggesting that reproductive phenology could be influenced more proximately by resources affecting the body condition of females around the time of conceptions. To assess how these controls operate, we compared the timing of births and conceptions among tropical and subtropical savanna ungulates with the patterns shown by ungulates in northern temperate or subarctic latitudes. The association between the timing of births and the onset of plant growth early in the growing season is less consistent among tropical savanna ungulates than among ungulates inhabiting northern temperate environments, and apparently subject to other influences affecting vegetation phenology. Nevertheless, birth peaks seem to coincide with the time of the year when forage quality is expected to be best for offspring survival and growth for most tropical or subtropical ungulates with gestation periods shorter than a year. When gestation time exceeds one year, proximal effects of nutritional conditions around the time of conceptions apparently become overriding and birth synchrony with early season plant growth is no longer effective. Proximate nutritional influences on conceptions may also govern the somewhat diffuse spread of births shown by ungulate populations in equatorial latitudes where photoperiod cues controlling oestrus and mating cannot be used to schedule the later timing of births.

A decade of seasonal dynamics and co-occurrences within freshwater bacterioplankton communities from eutrophic Lake Mendota, WI, USA	ISME JOURNAL												With an unprecedented decade-long time series from a temperate eutrophic lake, we analyzed bacterial and environmental co-occurrence networks to gain insight into seasonal dynamics at the community level. We found that (1) bacterial co-occurrence networks were non-random, (2) season explained the network complexity and (3) co-occurrence network complexity was negatively correlated with the underlying community diversity across different seasons. Network complexity was not related to the variance of associated environmental factors. Temperature and productivity may drive changes in diversity across seasons in temperate aquatic systems, much as they control diversity across latitude. While the implications of bacterioplankton network structure on ecosystem function are still largely unknown, network analysis, in conjunction with traditional multivariate techniques, continues to increase our understanding of bacterioplankton temporal dynamics.

Aedes aegypti pharate 1st instar quiescence: A case for anticipatory reproductive plasticity	JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY												Aedes aegypti mosquitoes use pharate 1st instar quiescence to cope with fluctuations in water availability hosting a fully developed 1st instar larvae within the chorion. The duration of this quiescence has been shown to affect larval fitness. This study sought to determine if an extended egg quiescence can elicit a plastic response resulting in an adult phenotype distinct from adults reared from short quiescence eggs. Our findings indicate that extended pharate 1st instar quiescence affects the performance and reproductive fitness of the adult female mosquito as well as the nutritional status of its progeny via maternal effects in an adaptive manner. This study demonstrates that phenotypic plasticity results as a consequence of the duration of pharate 1st instar quiescence and alternative phenotypes may exist for this mosquito with quiescence serving as a cue possibly signaling the environmental conditions that follow a dry period. These findings have implications for A. aegypti's success as a vector, geographic distribution, vector capacity and control.

Geographically multifarious phenotypic divergence during speciation	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Speciation is an important evolutionary process that occurs when barriers to gene flow evolve between previously panmictic populations. Although individual barriers to gene flow have been studied extensively, we know relatively little regarding the number of barriers that isolate species or whether these barriers are polymorphic within species. Herein, we use a series of field and lab experiments to quantify phenotypic divergence and identify possible barriers to gene flow between the butterfly species Lycaeides idas and Lycaeides melissa. We found evidence that L.idas and L.melissa have diverged along multiple phenotypic axes. Specifically, we identified major phenotypic differences in female oviposition preference and diapause initiation, and more moderate divergence in mate preference. Multiple phenotypic differences might operate as barriers to gene flow, as shown by correlations between genetic distance and phenotypic divergence and patterns of phenotypic variation in admixed Lycaeides populations. Although some of these traits differed primarily between species (e.g., diapause initiation), several traits also varied among conspecific populations (e.g., male mate preference and oviposition preference).

Seed Treatment Optimizes Benefits of Seed Bank Storage for Restoration-Ready Seeds: The Feasibility of Prestorage Dormancy Alleviation for Mine-Site Revegetation	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Dormant seeds of 18 species from 9 families covering a diverse range of seed dormancy syndromes and life histories from the southwest Australian biodiversity hotspot were assessed for germinability following storage at 1525 degrees C for 36 months. A total of 10 species with physical dormancy (PY) and 8 with either physiological dormancy (PD) or morphophysiological dormancy (MPD) were assessed as part of the study. Prior to storage, germination from dormant seeds was 127%, rising to 41100% following specific dormancy-breaking treatments. When seed dormancy was removed prior to storage for 36 months seeds from all species were found to maintain a nondormant state and germinate to a similar level to that observed at the beginning of the experiment (44100%). Likewise, seeds that did not receive a prestorage dormancy-breaking treatment maintained a dormant state (050% germination) and subsequently responded well to a dormancy-breaking treatment immediately prior to germination assessment (4999%). There were minimal differences in response to dormancy-breaking treatments before and after 36 months storage (average 46% difference) and in the germination responses observed between both storage environments assessed (15 degrees C/15% eRH or 1525 degrees C air dried). Based on these findings, storing seeds in a nondormant state does not alter germinability and this approach provides significant benefits to current seed-based restoration programs through reduction of double handling and improved seed use efficiency.				dixon, kingsley/A-8133-2016; Dixon, Kingsley/B-1042-2011; Steadman, Kathryn/C-3401-2008; Turner, Shane/A-9950-2011	dixon, kingsley/0000-0001-5989-2929; Steadman, Kathryn/0000-0001-7357-330X; 												1061-2971					MAR	2013	21	2					186	192		10.1111/j.1526-100X.2012.00879.x								WOS:000316075000010

Here, we extend life-table response experiments (LTREs) to variable environments, showing how to quantify contributions made by (1) mean vital rates, (2) variability driven by environmental fluctuations, (3) correlations implying demographic trade-offs and reflecting stage transition synchrony, and (4) elasticities reflecting local selection pressures. Applying our methods to the lady's slipper orchid Cypripedium calceolus, we found that mean rates accounted for 77.1% of all effects on the stochastic growth rate, variability accounted for 12.6%, elasticities accounted for 6.6%, and correlations accounted for 3.7%. Stochastic effects accounted for 17.6%, 15.3%, and 35.9% of the total in our three populations. Larger elasticities to transitions between dormancy states and stronger correlations between emergence and survival suggest that one population was under greater pressure to remain active while the other two showed survival payoffs for dormancy in poor years. Strong negative correlations between dormancy, emergence, and stasis balanced opposing contributions, resulting in near stationarity in two populations. These new methods provide an additional tool for researchers investigating stochastic population dynamics and should be useful for a broad range of applications in basic ecology and conservation biology.																	0003-0147	1537-5323				MAR	2013	181	3					410	420		10.1086/669155								WOS:000315927900012	23448889

To elucidate the key gene for adaptation in rice cultivars to the northern limit of rice cultivation, we conducted genetic analyses of heading date using extremely early-heading cultivars. The Hd5 gene controlling heading date (flowering time) generated variations in heading date among cultivars adapted to Hokkaido, where is the northernmost region of Japan and one of the northern limits of rice cultivation in the world. The association of the Hd5 genotype with heading date and genetical analysis clearly showed that the loss-of-function Hd5 has an important role in exhibiting earlier heading among a local population in Hokkaido. Distinct distribution of the loss-of-function Hd5 revealed that this mutation event of the 19-bp deletion occurred in a local landrace Bouzu and that this mutation may have been selected as an early-heading variety in rice breeding programs in Hokkaido in the early 1900s. The loss-of-function Hd5 was then introduced into the rice variety Fanny from France and contributed to its extremely early heading under the presence of functional Ghd7. These results demonstrated that Hd5 plays roles not only in generating early heading in variations of heading date among a local population in Hokkaido, but also in extremely early heading for adaptation to northern limits of rice cultivation.

Four models (M1-M4) were optimised on long-term phenological observations from the Ecological Research Centre Schluchtern (Hessen/Germany). Model M1 was a common thermal time model that accumulates growing degree days (GDD) on an optimised starting date t (1). Since egg laying of Great Tit is influenced not only by air temperature but also by photoperiod, model M1 was extended by a daylength term to give M2. The other two models, M3 and M4, correspond to M1 and M2, but t (1) was intentionally set to 1 January, in order to consider already rising temperatures at the beginning of the year. A comparison of the four models led to following results: model M1 had a relatively high root mean square error at verification (RMSEver) of more than 4 days and can be used only to calculate the start of egg laying for current climate conditions because of the relatively late starting date for GDD calculation. The model failed completely if the starting date was set to 1 January (M3). Consideration of a daylength term in models M2 and M4 improved the performance of both models strongly (RMSEver of only 3 days or less), increased the credibility of parameter estimation, and was a precondition to calculate reliable projections in the timing of egg laying in birds for the future. These results confirm that the start of egg laying of Great Tit is influenced not only by air temperature, but also by photoperiod. Although models M2 and M4 both provide comparably good results for current climate conditions, we recommend model M4-with a starting date of temperature accumulation on 1 January-for calculating possible future shifts in the commencement of egg laying. Our regional projections in the start of egg laying, based on five regional climate models (RCMs: REMO-UBA, ECHAM5-CLM, HadCM3-CLM, WETTREG-0, WETTREG-1, GHG emission scenario A1B), indicate that in the near future (2011-2040) no significant change will take place. However, in the mid- (2041-2070) and long-term (2071-2100) range the beginning of egg laying could be advanced significantly by up to 11 days on average of all five RCMs. This result corresponds to the already observed shift in the timing of egg laying by about 1 week, due mainly to an abrupt increase in air temperature at the end of the 1980s by 1.2 K between April and May. The use of five regional climate scenarios additionally allowed to estimate uncertainties among the RCMs.																	0020-7128					MAR	2013	57	2					287	297		10.1007/s00484-012-0553-7								WOS:000314897300007	22588698

Essential elements of discourse for advancing the modelling of species' current and potential distributions	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												A recent review by Dormann etal. (2012, Journal of Biogeography, 39, 21192131) has proposed that methods for the modelling of species distributions be considered as a continuum. We disagree with this thesis, and contend that attempting to present the diverse range of methods as a continuum is unhelpful and ultimately not convincing. It adds to the confusion about the strengths and weaknesses of the diversity of available modelling methods, what exactly it is that they model, and the most appropriate applications. We highlight variation within and between modelling methods that is obscured by the continuum framework and propose that context of application and clarity of method are critical elements for future discourse on the topic.

J	Zandian, A; Ashjaee, M				Zandian, Arash; Ashjaee, Mehdi			The thermal efficiency improvement of a steam Rankine cycle by innovative design of a hybrid cooling tower and a solar chimney concept	RENEWABLE ENERGY												In the present work, a dry cooling tower and a solar chimney design are recombined in order to increase the thermal efficiency of a steam Rankine cycle. The rejected heat from the condenser into the dry cooling tower supplemented by the solar radiation gained through its transparent cover are the sources of wind energy generation that is captured by a wind turbine which is located at the beginning of the chimney. In this research a case study for a 250 MW steam power plant of Shahid Rajaee in Iran has been performed. A CFD finite volume code is developed to find the generated wind velocity at the turbine entrance for a 250 m dry cooling tower base diameter and a chimney height of 200 m. Calculations have been iterated for different ambient temperatures and solar irradiances, representing temperature gradient within day length. A range of 360 kW to 3 MW power is obtained for the change in the chimney diameter from 10 to 50 m. The results show a maximum of 0.37 percent increase in the thermal efficiency of a 250 MW fossil fuel power plant unit; which proves this design to be a significant improvement in efficiency of thermal power plants, by capturing the heat that is dissipated from dry cooling towers.

Reproductive Dormancy in Boll-Weevil From Populations of the Midwest of Brazil	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY												The boll weevil (Anthonomus grandis Boheman) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is an introduced pest in Brazil, which in 30 yr has successfully expanded to various eco-regions and became the most important pest of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum, Malvaceae). Given the limited knowledge about the adaptive mechanisms that allowed successful establishment of the pest population in a tropical region, in this work we studied the potential of the Midwest population of boll weevils to enter a reproductive dormancy and identified the importance of the feeding source for induction of dormancy. We investigated morphological and physiological characters as indicators of the dormancy. We also investigated the occurrence of reproductive dormancy in boll weevils populations from cotton farms of the Midwestern region of Brazil during the cotton and noncotton seasons of 2009 and 2010. The studies revealed that boll weevils entered facultative reproductive dormancy; however, unlike what has been observed for boll weevils from temperate and subtropical regions, the hypertrophy of fat body and hexamerin levels did not straightly correlated to reproductive dormancy. The food source and field conditions during early adult development were decisive factor for the induction of reproductive dormancy. The incidence of reproductive dormancy increased progressively as the phenology of cotton plant advanced, reaching approximate to 90% at the end of the crop season. During the noncotton season, the boll weevil was predominantly found in reproductive dormancy, especially females; however, there is evidence of use of multiple adaptive strategies to colonize the next harvest.

Abundance and Distribution of Western and Northern Corn Rootworm (Diabrotica spp.) and Prevalence of Rotation Resistance in Eastern Iowa	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY												The western corn rootworm Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) and the northern corn rootworm Diabrotica barberi Smith&Lawrence (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) are major pests of corn (Zea mays L.). Historically, crop rotation has been an effective management strategy, but both species have adapted to crop rotation in the Midwest. For both species in eastern Iowa, we measured abundance and prevalence of rotation resistance using sticky traps and emergence cages in fields of corn and soybean (Glycine max L.). Based on currently available data, we calculated the economic thresholds for these pests at two Diabrotica spp. per trap per day in cornfields and 1.5 D. v. virgifera per trap per day in soybean fields. The economic injury level of rotation-resistant D. barberi was determined to be 3.5 adult insects per emergence cage per year. Peak abundance of rootworm adults in cornfields was below economic thresholds in the majority of fields sampled, suggesting that management of rootworm larvae in continuous cornfields may not always be necessary. Rotation-resistant D. barberi was found throughout eastern Iowa using emergence cages in first-year cornfields, however, the abundance was below levels expected to impose economic injury in 14 of 17 fields evaluated. The presence of rotation-resistant D. v. virgifera, as measured by the occurrence of this insect in soybean fields, occurred only in northeastern Iowa and was also below the economic threshold. These data suggests that crop rotation remains a viable pest management strategy in eastern Iowa.				sebastianovitsch, stepan/G-8507-2013													0022-0493	1938-291X				FEB	2013	106	1					168	180		10.1603/EC11291								WOS:000314882200022	23448029

Effects of Short Photoperiod on Codling Moth Diapause and Survival	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY												The potential presence of codling moth, Cydia pomonella L., in apples shipped to countries within the 30th latitudes has raised concerns that this pest could establish and spread in these countries. Previous research demonstrated that codling moth in apples handled under simulated commercial cold storage conditions and held under short day lengths could not break diapause and emerge in sufficient numbers to establish a minimum viable population. This study expands the in-fruit work by examining the ability of codling moth to establish a laboratory population under a short photoperiod of 12: 12 ( L: D) h, as compared with a long photoperiod of 16: 8 ( L: D) h. Codling moth larvae were collected from field infested fruits in 2010 and 2011. Moths were collected from the infested fruits and separated into two groups representing the two daylength conditions. In total, 1,004 larvae were monitored for adult emergence and ability to generate a subsequent population. Larvae held under the photoperiod of 12: 12 ( L: D) h generated only one moth in the 2 yr period, whereas larvae held under the photoperiod of 16: 8 ( L: D) h generated 186 females and 179 males, that sustained subsequent generations on artificial diet under laboratory conditions. These results indicate that under controlled environmental conditions, codling moth cannot complete diapause and emerge in sufficient numbers to sustain a viable population when held under a short photoperiod.																	0022-0493					FEB	2013	106	1					520	523		10.1603/EC12366								WOS:000314882200062	23448069

Jessica E.; McMahon, Sean M.; Salguero-Gomez, Roberto; Jongejans, Eelke			IPMpack: an R package for integral projection models	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Structured demographic models offer powerful methods for addressing important questions in ecology and evolution. Integral Projection Models (IPMs) are related to classic matrix models, but are more appropriate for modelling structured populations when the variable describing individuals' demography is continuous (e.g. size, weight, etc.). We present IPMpack, a free open-source software (R) package for building IPMs. The package estimates key population characteristics from IPMs, such as population growth rate in both deterministic and stochastic environments, age-specific trajectories of survival and reproduction, and sensitivities and elasticities to changes in underlying vital rates. IPMpack can be used for species across a range of life cycle complexity and can include continuous and discrete (e.g. seed bank, hibernation) state variables, as well as environmental covariates of interest. Methods for diagnostics, sensitivity analyses, plotting, model comparison and many other features allow users to move from data input through analysis to inference using an array of internal functions. IPMpack fills a need for readily usable tools for constructing and analysing IPMs and is designed to facilitate their use for experts and open up their use for those researchers who have little experience in the details of population models. A standardized IPM modelling framework will also facilitate cross-study and cross-species comparative demography, encouraging the exploration of broader ecological and evolutionary questions that can be addressed by population models.

Stage and age structured Aedes vexans and Culex pipiens (Diptera: Culicidae) climate-dependent matrix population model	THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY												Aedes vexans and Culex pipiens mosquitoes are potential vectors of many arbovirial diseases. Due to the ongoing climate changes and reappearance of some zoonoses that were considered eradicated, there is a growing concern about potential disease outbreaks. Therefore, the prediction of increased adult population abundances becomes an essential tool for the appropriate implementation of mosquito control strategies. In order to describe the population dynamics of A. vexans and C pipiens mosquitoes in temperate climate regions, a 3-year period (2008-2010) climate-dependent model was constructed. The models represent a combination of mathematical modeling and computer simulations, and include temperature, rainfall, photoperiods, and the flooding dynamics of A. vexans breeding sites. Both models are structured according to the developmental stages, and by individuals' "age" (i.e., time spent in each developmental stage), as we wanted to enable a time delay between the appearances of different developmental stages of mosquitoes. The time delay length is temperature dependent, with temperature being the most important factor influencing morphogenesis rates in immatures and gonotrophic cycle durations in adult mosquitoes. To determine which developmental stages are the most sensitive and are those at which control measures should be aimed, transient elasticities were calculated. The analysis showed that both mosquito species reacted to perturbation of the same matrix elements; however, in the C pipiens model, the stage with greatest proportional sensitivity (i.e., elasticity) during most of the three-year reproduction season contained adults, while in the A. vexans model it contained larvae. The models were validated by comparing 7-day model outputs with data on human bait collection (HBC) obtained from the Public Health Institute of Osijek-Baranja, with both model outputs showing valid compatibility with field data over the three-year period. The proposed models can easily be modified to describe population dynamics of other mosquito species in different geographical areas, as well as for assessing the efficiency and optimization of different mosquito control strategies.

Seasonality and site fidelity of the zebra shark, Stegostoma fasciatum, in southeast Queensland, Australia	ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR												Site fidelity and migratory movements of vertebrate animals occur at many spatial and temporal scales. Larger migratory movements tend to occur in species that live in seasonal environments in which food supplies vary markedly, while species found in thermally stable environments are more site-attached. In the marine environment, seasonal migrations are often associated with predictable temporary aggregations that have largely been targeted for exploitation. We employed passive acoustic telemetry to investigate inter- and intraseasonal site fidelity of zebra sharks to an aggregation site in southeast Queensland, Australia, close to the southern latitudinal extent of this species' range. We tracked 10 zebra sharks over two aggregation seasons (21 months). We applied a generalized linear mixed-effects model to investigate the presence/absence of these zebra sharks with respect to several environmental variables. We found that different environmental factors were associated with site fidelity of zebra sharks at different temporal levels and that these may be indicative of the mechanisms driving the movements. Seasonal patterns may be driven by endogenous systems, and cues such as photoperiod and water temperature are likely to be important. Intraseasonal patterns are more likely to be indicative of direct behavioural responses to changes in environmental conditions such as increased wave heights, as well as foraging bouts away from a core refuge. Understanding the relative contributions of these environmental parameters, as well as biological factors, will be important for making predictions of site fidelity and movements of migratory marine vertebrates under differing future scenarios such as increases in sea temperature.

J	Haider, M; Dorn, S; Muller, A				Haider, Mare; Dorn, Silvia; Mueller, Andreas			Intra- and interpopulational variation in the ability of a solitary bee species to develop on non-host pollen: implications for host range expansion	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												Pollen host choice in bees is in many cases highly conserved, which might partly be due to physiological limitations of bee larvae to digest non-host pollen. These limitations need to be overcome in order to incorporate new pollen hosts; however, the mechanisms underlying such host expansion are poorly understood. In this study, we examined intra- and interpopulational variation in the ability of larvae of the solitary bee species Osmia cornuta (Megachilidae) to develop on a non-host pollen diet of Ranunculus acris (Ranunculaceae) by comparing larval performance within and between five geographically distant European populations. The majority of bee larvae from all tested populations died when reared on the Ranunculus pollen diet. Between 10% and 43.5% of all larvae per population reached the cocoon stage, and 48% of these emerged as viable adults from the cocoons, indicating that the physiological ability to cope with the unfavourable properties of Ranunculus pollen exists in each population. The bee larvae of one population exhibited significantly reduced survival on the Ranunculus pollen diet compared with three of the four other populations. Although bees that successfully developed on the Ranunculus pollen diet showed a distinctly prolonged development time, exhibited higher mortality during diapause and reached a considerably lower adult weight compared with individuals fed the control pollen diet, several of the Ranunculus fed individuals were able to reproduce and to sire viable offspring. This study provides the first evidence for both intra- and interpopulational variation in the physiological ability of solitary bees to digest non-host pollen. This variation might enable host expansion and subsequent host shifts in response to natural selection.																	0269-8463					FEB	2013	27	1					255	263		10.1111/1365-2435.12021								WOS:000314166500027

Energetic constraints may limit the capacity of visually guided predators to respond to Arctic warming	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												For many polar species, climate change is likely to result in range contractions and negative population trends. For those species whose distribution is limited by sea ice and cold water, however, polar warming could result in population increases and range expansion. Population increases of great cormorants Phalacrocorax carbo in Greenland are associated with warmer sea surface temperatures, but the actual impact of environmental change on cormorant spatial ecology remains unclear. In the present study, we investigate how Arctic warming is likely to influence the distribution of cormorants in Greenland. Using geolocation data, we show that many individuals that breed above the Arctic Circle migrate south and winter at lower latitude. We then couple estimates of migratory flight costs with a model that predicts daily energy expenditure during winter on the basis of water temperature, ambient illumination during diving, dive depth and day length. This model shows that the most energy efficient strategy predicted for any breeding location is to migrate as far south as possible, and that, for a given wintering location, it is more energetically expensive to breed at high latitude. We argue that cormorants currently undertake a winter migration to escape the polar night and reduce winter energy costs and that their wintering grounds in Greenland will remain largely unchanged under Arctic warming. This is because low levels of ambient illumination during the polar night will continue to restrict foraging opportunities at high latitude during winter. Northward expansion of the breeding range will result in increased energy expenditure associated with long migratory flights, and the cost of such flights may ultimately limit the breeding range of cormorants. Such limitations are likely to represent a general constraint on the capacity of visually guided predators to respond to climate warming, and may limit the predicted poleward range shifts of these species.

Development of the Teneral Adult Anoplophora glabripennis (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae): Time to Initiate and Completely Bore Out of Maple Wood	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												Anoplophora glabripennis (Motschulsky) is an introduced invasive pest with the potential to devastate hardwood forests in North America. Using artificial pupal chambers, we documented the time required by teneral adults at three temperatures (20, 25, and 30 degrees C), 60-80% RH, and a photoperiod of 16:8 (L:D) h to initiate boring after eclosion and subsequently bore completely through a 7-mm (range, 3-11 mm) layer of Norway maple wood (Acer platanoides L.). In total, 218 laboratory-reared pupae from the Chicago, IL, or Inner Mongolia, China, populations were used in the study. Females (1.54 +/- 0.03 g) weighed signi_cantly more than males (1.12 +/- 0.03 g), but the average weights of the beetles emerging in each temperature did not differ. Adult weight was positively correlated with exit hole diameter (diameter[mm] = 2.2 * weight [g] + 7.9). The rate at which beetles bored through the wood (136, 178, and 168 mm(3)/d at 20, 25 and 30 degrees C, respectively) significantly differed between temperatures but did not differ with beetle weight. Temperature had a significant effect on the time it took adults to initiate boring (7, 5, and 4 d at 20, 25, and 30 degrees C, respectively) and subsequently to complete boring to emerge (5, 4, and 4 d at 20, 25, and 30 degrees C, respectively). This suggests that beetles require more than a week to progress from eclosion to emergence in wood, even at summer temperatures. This information on A. glabripennis basic biology is critical for developing phenology models that are used to time exclusion and eradication methodologies.

The freshwater ostracod (Ostracoda), Eucypris virens, is commonly found in European temporary pools, where its long-term persistence completely relies on the build-up of resting egg banks. Extreme tolerance of dormant eggs and seeds is widely assumed, but freshwater ostracod eggs are relatively poorly studied. The study of ostracod resting eggs is of particular relevance as it may yield the key to understanding the distribution of the sexes in many species capable of both sexual and asexual reproduction. 2. We assessed the tolerance of dried resting eggs produced by females originating from three populations with males and three all-female E. virens populations. Hatching time and success was compared between control eggs and eggs exposed to one of seven ecologically relevant stressors: digestive enzymes, high salinity, deep freezing, hydration, UV-B radiation, hypoxia and insecticide treatment. 3. None of the stressors reduced significantly the viability of either sexual or asexual eggs. When compared with the reproductive modespecific controls, exposure to UV-B radiation had a mild impact on the survival of sexual and asexual eggs (-16.8 and -22.4%, respectively), but this was only significant for asexual eggs. These results point to an extreme tolerance of E. virens resting eggs and have important implications for the ecology and evolution of the species. 4. The timing of hatching was not affected by the stress treatment, except for UV-B radiation. A marginally significant delay in hatching response was observed for UV-B-radiated eggs when compared to the overall mean, but this treatment effect was absent when compared with the reproductive modespecific controls. 5. The populations with males produced eggs that hatched on average earlier (-1.5 days at 17 degrees C) and were more successful (+26%) than asexual eggs. Due to the limited number of populations and the population-specific origin and age of the eggs, the possibility due to the differences in age and origin of the resting eggs, or to variations in local conditions, cannot be ruled out.

In the symbiosis of the solitary digger wasp, Philanthus triangulum (Hymenoptera, Crabronidae), the bacterial symbiont 'Candidatus Streptomyces philanthi' defends the developing larvae against pathogens by producing a mixture of at least nine antimicrobial substances on the cocoon surface. This antibiotic cocktail inhibits the growth of a broad range of detrimental fungi and bacteria, thereby significantly enhancing the offspring's survival probability. Results: Here we show that the production of antimicrobial compounds by the beewolf symbionts is confined to the first two weeks after cocoon spinning, leading to a high concentration of piericidins and streptochlorin on the cocoon surface. Expression profiling of housekeeping, sporulation, and antibiotic biosynthesis genes indicates that antibiotic production coincides with morphological differentiation that enables the symbionts to survive the nutrient-limited conditions on the beewolf cocoon. The antibiotic substances remain stable on the cocoon surface for the entire duration of the beewolf's hibernation period, demonstrating that the compounds are resistant against environmental influences. Conclusions: The antibiotic production by the beewolf symbionts serves as a reliable protection for the wasp offspring against pathogenic microorganisms during the long and unpredictable developmental phase in the subterranean brood cells. Thus, the beewolf-Streptomyces symbiosis provides one of the rare examples of antibiotics serving as an efficient defense in the natural environment and may aid in devising new strategies for the utilization of antibiotic combination therapies in human medicine against increasingly resistant bacterial and fungal pathogens.

Thompson; Bruemmer, Jason			Contraception can Lead to Trophic Asynchrony between Birth Pulse and Resources	PLOS ONE												Abiotic inputs such as photoperiod and temperature can regulate reproductive cyclicity in many species. When humans perturb this process by intervening in reproductive cycles, the ecological consequences may be profound. Trophic mismatches between birth pulse and resources in wildlife species may cascade toward decreased survival and threaten the viability of small populations. We followed feral horses (Equus caballus) in three populations for a longitudinal study of the transient immunocontraceptive porcine zona pellucida (PZP), and found that repeated vaccinations extended the duration of infertility far beyond the targeted period. After the targeted years of infertility, the probability of parturition from post-treated females was 25.6% compared to 64.1% for untreated females, when the data were constrained only to females that had demonstrated fertility prior to the study. Estimated time to parturition increased 411.3 days per year of consecutive historical treatment. Births from untreated females in these temperate latitude populations were observed to peak in the middle of May, indicating peak conception occurred around the previous summer solstice. When the post-treated females did conceive and give birth, parturition was an estimated 31.5 days later than births from untreated females, resulting in asynchrony with peak forage availability. The latest neonate born to a post-treated female arrived 7.5 months after the peak in births from untreated females, indicating conception occurred within 24-31 days of the winter solstice. These results demonstrate surprising physiological plasticity for temperate latitude horses, and indicate that while photoperiod and temperature are powerful inputs driving the biological rhythms of conception and birth in horses, these inputs may not limit their ability to conceive under perturbed conditions. The protracted infertility observed in PZP-treated horses may be of benefit for managing overabundant wildlife, but also suggests caution for use in small refugia or rare species.

Transgenic Fluorescent Plasmodium cynomolgi Liver Stages Enable Live Imaging and Purification of Malaria Hypnozoite-Forms	PLOS ONE												A major challenge for strategies to combat the human malaria parasite Plasmodium vivax is the presence of hypnozoites in the liver. These dormant forms can cause renewed clinical disease after reactivation through unknown mechanisms. The closely related non-human primate malaria P. cynomolgi is a frequently used model for studying hypnozoite-induced relapses. Here we report the generation of the first transgenic P. cynomolgi parasites that stably express fluorescent markers in liver stages by transfection with novel DNA-constructs containing a P. cynomolgi centromere. Analysis of fluorescent liver stages in culture identified, in addition to developing liver-schizonts, uninucleate persisting parasites that were atovaquone resistant but primaquine sensitive, features associated with hypnozoites. We demonstrate that these hypnozoite-forms could be isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The fluorescently-tagged parasites in combination with FACS-purification open new avenues for a wide range of studies for analysing hypnozoite biology and reactivation.

Invasive Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata) populations have experienced a rapid range expansion and intense selection by insecticides. By comparing native and invasive beetle populations, we studied the origins of organophosphate (OP) resistance-associated mutations in the acetylcholinesterase 2 (AChE2) gene, and the role of selection and demography on its genetic variability. Results: Analysis of three Mexican, two US and five European populations yielded a total of 49 haplotypes. Contrary to the expectations all genetic variability was associated with a point mutation linked to insecticide resistance (S291G), this mutation was found in 100% of Mexican, 95% of US and 71% of European beetle sequences analysed. Only two susceptible haplotypes, genetically very differentiated, were found, one in US and one in Europe. The genetic variability at the AChE2 gene was compared with two other genes not directly affected by insecticide selection, diapause protein 1 and juvenile hormone esterase. All three genes showed reduction in genetic variability indicative of a population bottleneck associated with the invasion. Conclusions: Stochastic effects during invasion explain most of the observed patterns of genetic variability at the three genes investigated. The high frequency of the S291G mutation in the AChE2 gene among native populations suggests this mutation is the ancestral state and thus, either a pre-adaptation of the beetle for OP resistance or the AChE2 is not the major gene conferring OP resistance. The long historical association with host plant alkaloids together with recombination may have contributed to the high genetic variation at this locus. The genetic diversity in the AChE2 locus of the European beetles, in turn, strongly reflects founder effects followed by rapid invasion. Our results suggest that despite the long history of insecticide use in this species, demographic events together with pre-invasion history have been strongly influential in shaping the genetic diversity of the AChE2 gene in the invasive beetle populations.

The range of environmental cues that trigger the onset and termination of diapause, in addition to associated hormonal, biochemical, and molecular changes, have been studied extensively in recent years; however, such information is only available for a few insect species. Diapause and cold hardening usually occur together in overwintering arthropods, and can be characterized by recording changes to the wealth of molecules present in the tissue, hemolymph, or whole body of organisms. Recent technological advances, such as high throughput screening and quantification of metabolites via chromatographic analyses, are able to identify such molecules. In the present work, we examined the survival ability of diapausing and non-diapausing females of the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae, in the presence (0 or 5 degrees C) or absence of cold acclimation. Furthermore, we examined the metabolic fingerprints of these specimens via gas chromatography-mass spectrophotometry (GC-MS). Partial Least Square Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) of metabolites revealed that major metabolic variations were related to diapause, indicating in a clear cut-off between diapausing and non-diapausing females, regardless of acclimation state. Signs of metabolic depression were evident in diapausing females, with most amino acids and TCA cycle intermediates being significantly reduced. Out of the 40 accurately quantified metabolites, seven metabolites remained elevated or were accumulated in diapausing mites, i.e. cadaverine, gluconolactone, glucose, inositol, maltose, mannitol and sorbitol. The capacity to accumulate winter polyols during cold-acclimation was restricted to diapausing females. We conclude that the induction of increased cold hardiness in this species is associated with the diapause syndrome, rather than being a direct effect of low temperature. Our results provide novel information about biochemical events related to the cold hardening process in the two-spotted spider mite.

Characterisation of the Maternal Response to Chronic Phase Shifts during Gestation in the Rat: Implications for Fetal Metabolic Programming	PLOS ONE												Disrupting maternal circadian rhythms through exposure to chronic phase shifts of the photoperiod has lifelong consequences for the metabolic homeostasis of the fetus, such that offspring develop increased adiposity, hyperinsulinaemia and poor glucose and insulin tolerance. In an attempt to determine the mechanisms by which these poor metabolic outcomes arise, we investigated the impact of chronic phase shifts (CPS) on maternal and fetal hormonal, metabolic and circadian rhythms. We assessed weight gain and food consumption of dams exposed to either CPS or control lighting conditions throughout gestation. At day 20, dams were assessed for plasma hormone and metabolite concentrations and glucose and insulin tolerance. Additionally, the expression of a range of circadian and metabolic genes was assessed in maternal, placental and fetal tissue. Control and CPS dams consumed the same amount of food, yet CPS dams gained 70% less weight during the first week of gestation. At day 20, CPS dams had reduced retroperitoneal fat pad weight (-15%), and time-of-day dependent decreases in liver weight, whereas fetal and placental weight was not affected. Melatonin secretion was not altered, yet the timing of corticosterone, leptin, glucose, insulin, free fatty acids, triglycerides and cholesterol concentrations were profoundly disrupted. The expression of gluconeogenic and circadian clock genes in maternal and fetal liver became either arrhythmic or were in antiphase to the controls. These results demonstrate that disruptions of the photoperiod can severely disrupt normal circadian profiles of plasma hormones and metabolites, as well as gene expression in maternal and fetal tissues. Disruptions in the timing of food consumption and the downstream metabolic processes required to utilise that food, may lead to reduced efficiency of growth such that maternal weight gain is reduced during early embryonic development. It is these perturbations that may contribute to the programming of poor metabolic homeostasis in the offspring.

J	Geshi, J; Fujisaki, K				Geshi, Junya; Fujisaki, Kenji			Northward Range Expansion of Nezara viridula in Kinki District, Japan: Expansion Speed	JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY												Recently, poleward range expansions in association with recent climate warming have been reported in several species around the world. In Japan, Nezara viridula, a serious pest of various crops, has been expanding its range northward, possibly due to climate warming. Data on the current distribution and accurate prediction of range expansion are important for pest management. Here, we show that the current distribution of N. viridula in the Kinki district has been expanded northward. Moreover, comparison of the current distribution with the data from five and fifty years ago reveals that the speed of range expansion has accelerated. In addition, the current distribution cannot be simply explained by temperature, which was previously believed to determine the northern limit of N. viridula, because the temperature in the current northern limit area does not meet the conditions. This suggests that factors other than temperature are also involved in the northward range expansion of N. viridula. To understand the impact of climate warming on the northward range expansion, it is important to consider not only temperature but also other factors, including physiological and/or behavioral adaptations.																	0021-4914	1347-6068					2013	57	3					151	157		10.1303/jjaez.2013.151								WOS:000339457100003

Hairy Root Cultures	SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL												Hypericum perforatum L. is a medicinal plant considered as an important natural source of secondary metabolites with a wide range of pharmacological attributes. Hairy roots (HR) were induced from root segments of in vitro grown seedlings from H. perforatum after cocultivation with Agrobacterium rhizogenes A4. Investigations have been made to study the production of phenolic compounds in dark-grown (HR1) and photoperiod-exposed (HR2) cultures. The chromatographic analysis of phenolic acids, flavonols, flavan-3-ols, and xanthones revealed marked differences between HR1 and HR2 cultures. The production of quinic acid, kaempferol, and seven identified xanthones was increased in HR2. Moreover, HR2 showed a capability for de novo biosynthesis of two phenolic acids (3-p-coumaroylquinic acid and 3-feruloylquinic acid), three flavonol glycosides (kaempferol hexoside, hyperoside, and quercetin acetylglycoside), and five xanthones (tetrahydroxy-one-methoxyxanthone, 1,3,5-trihydroxy-6-methoxyxanthone, 1,3,5,6-tetrahydroxy-2-prenylxanthone, paxanthone, and banaxanthone E). On the other side, HR1 cultures were better producers of flavan-3-ols (catechin, epicatechin, and proanthocyanidin dimers) than HR2. This is the first comparative study on phenolic profile of H. perforatum HR cultures grown under dark and photoperiod conditions.

Retrospective genomic analysis of sorghum adaptation to temperate-zone grain production	GENOME BIOLOGY												Background: Sorghum is a tropical C4 cereal that recently adapted to temperate latitudes and mechanized grain harvest through selection for dwarfism and photoperiod-insensitivity. Quantitative trait loci for these traits have been introgressed from a dwarf temperate donor into hundreds of diverse sorghum landraces to yield the Sorghum Conversion lines. Here, we report the first comprehensive genomic analysis of the molecular changes underlying this adaptation. Results: We apply genotyping-by-sequencing to 1,160 Sorghum Conversion lines and their exotic progenitors, and map donor introgressions in each Sorghum Conversion line. Many Sorghum Conversion lines carry unexpected haplotypes not found in either presumed parent. Genome-wide mapping of introgression frequencies reveals three genomic regions necessary for temperate adaptation across all Sorghum Conversion lines, containing the Dw1, Dw2, and Dw3 loci on chromosomes 9, 6, and 7 respectively. Association mapping of plant height and flowering time in Sorghum Conversion lines detects significant associations in the Dw1 but not the Dw2 or Dw3 regions. Subpopulation-specific introgression mapping suggests that chromosome 6 contains at least four loci required for temperate adaptation in different sorghum genetic backgrounds. The Dw1 region fractionates into separate quantitative trait loci for plant height and flowering time. Conclusions: Generating Sorghum Conversion lines has been accompanied by substantial unintended gene flow. Sorghum adaptation to temperate-zone grain production involves a small number of genomic regions, each containing multiple linked loci for plant height and flowering time. Further characterization of these loci will accelerate the adaptation of sorghum and related grasses to new production systems for food and fuel.																	1465-6906	1474-760X					2013	14	6							R68	10.1186/gb-2013-14-6-r68								WOS:000328194200016	23803286

First record of the harlequin ladybird, Harmonia axyridis (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) in the Caucasus	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY												This is the first record of the harlequin ladybird Harmonia axyridis (Pallas) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) occurring in the Caucasus (Sochi region of Krasnodar territory, Russia). All the adults collected in the field there and reared from collected eggs, larvae and pupae, and their progeny were H. axyridis f. succinea, which is the most common morph in natural populations in South-Eastern Asia and the Russian Far East as well as in invasive populations in the Americas and Europe. In contrast in Western Siberia f. axyridis predominates and this indicates that an occasional introduction from the closest native range in Siberia cannot be considered as the source of the Caucasian population. It is known that populations of H. axyridis can also differ in their photoperiodic responses. The results of earlier experiments on H. axyridis, which originated from the Russian Far East, indicate that the threshold day lengths for the acceleration of preimaginal development and deceleration of reproductive maturation were 13-14 h, while for the invasive populations of this species in Europe these two thresholds are approximately 12 h. In the population studied, the thresholds for both of these photoperiodic responses were also approximately 12 h. Thus, it is concluded that the population of H. axyridis studied is a further eastward continuation of the invasion of this species in Europe.					, Natalia/0000-0002-9192-5871; Reznik, Sergey/0000-0001-7310-2567												1210-5759						2013	110	4					699	702		10.14411/eje.2013.093								WOS:000325283200019

Thermoregulation in free-ranging Nycteris thebaica (Nycteridae) during winter: No evidence of torpor	MAMMALIAN BIOLOGY												Bats are among the most heterothermic mammals, with nearly all species investigated under free-ranging conditions to date exhibiting some degree of daily torpor and/or hibernation. We investigated thermoregulation during late winter by seven Nycteris thebaica in a warm, semi-arid habitat in northern South Africa, using temperature-sensitive transmitters to measure skin temperature (T-skin). Unexpectedly, we found no evidence for any expression of daily torpor or hibernation based on a total of 86 days of data from 7 bats (one male and six females), despite air temperatures as low as similar to 10 degrees C. Instead, daytime T-skin,10 was distributed unimodally with most values in the 33-35 degrees C range, and a minimum T-skin of 28.4 degrees C at a roost temperature of 24.6 degrees C. There are several possible reasons why N. thebaica may avoid torpor, including predation in roosts, and the long nightly foraging periods of this species compared to many others.

J	Voinovich, ND; Vaghina, NP; Reznik, SY				Voinovich, Natalia D.; Vaghina, Nina P.; Reznik, Sergey Ya			Comparative analysis of maternal and grand-maternal photoperiodic responses of Trichogramma species (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae)	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY												Maternal and grand-maternal photoperiodic responses of Trichogramma buesi, T. embryophagum, T. evanescens, T. piceum, T. principium, and T. telengai were investigated in laboratory conditions. During the experiment, grand-maternal and maternal generations developed at 20 degrees C and one of the 4 photoperiodic regimes: L : D = 12 : 12, 14 : 10, 16 : 8, and 18 : 6 (in total, 16 combinations) while the progeny developed at L : D = 12 : 12 and one of the 3 thermal regimes: 13, 14, and 15 degrees C. The proportion of diapausing individuals in the progeny of all the studied species was significantly dependent on the direct influence of temperature and on the maternal photoperiodic response. The influence of the photoperiodic conditions during development of the grandmaternal generation was statistically significant in 5 of the 6 studied species, being relatively weak in T. embryophagum and T. telengai, whose geographical ranges extend up to north-western regions of Europe (possibly, these wasps enter diapause so early that the grand-mothers of the diapausing generation develop under long day conditions). Comparative analysis showed that the thresholds of the maternal and grand-maternal photoperiodic responses coincided or almost coincided. The grand-maternal effect was stronger in the progeny of maternal females which developed under short day conditions than in those that developed under long day conditions. This pattern of interaction probably synchronizes the life cycle with seasonal changes because diapause is induced under decreasing day length and thus mothers of diapausing individuals develop at shorter daylength than do grand-mothers. We conclude that the grand-maternal and the maternal effects on Trichogramma progeny diapause are based on one and the same photoperiodic response. In nature, the grand-maternal effect increases the proportion of diapausing individuals in the progeny of females which have developed under short day conditions during two generations, thus achieving a "cumulative" photoperiodic effect.

The significance of midsummer movements of Autographa gamma: Implications for a mechanistic understanding of orientation behavior in a migrant moth	CURRENT ZOOLOGY												The silver Y moth Autographa gamma undertakes windborne spring and fall migrations between winter breeding regions around the Mediterranean and summer breeding regions in northern Europe. Flight behaviors facilitating these migrations include: (i) selection of seasonally-favorable tailwinds; (ii) flying at the altitude of the fastest winds; (iii) adopting flight headings that partially counteract crosswind drift; and (iv) seasonal reversal of preferred directions between spring and fall. In the UK, radar measurements indicate that migratory activity is pronounced during the spring and fall, but is usually very low during midsummer (July). However, an atypically intense period of high-altitude flight was recorded during July 2006, and in this study we compare the flight behavior of A. gamma during these midsummer movements with the more typical spring and fall migrations. During July 2006, activity was most intense at significantly lower altitudes than occurred in spring or fall, and was not associated with the height of the fastest winds; consequently displacement speeds were significantly slower. The most striking difference was an absence of tailwind selectivity in July with windborne movements occurring on almost every night of the month and on tailwinds from all directions. Finally, orientation behavior was quantitatively different during July, with significantly greater dispersion of flight headings and displacements than observed in spring and fall. We discuss mechanisms which could have caused these differences, and conclude that a lack of appropriate photoperiod cues during development of the summer generation resulted in randomly-oriented 'dispersive' movements that were strikingly different from typical seasonal migrations.

The entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin (sensu lato) is one of the facultative insect pathogens with significant host range and host specificity. In this study, the effects of eight common pesticides used in rice fields were studied on the germination of B. bassiana. The experiments were carried out in the laboratory at 25 +/- 1 degrees C, 80 +/- 5% RH and a 16h-photoperiod. The isolates Mcb 6, EUT 116, IRAN 429C and DEBI 005 of B. bassiana were treated with the field recommended rate of the pesticides. Experiments were performed according to the completely randomized design (CRD). The results showed that fungicides had the highest adverse effect on the germination of the isolates of B. bassiana. So it can be concluded that fungicides are limitation factors for activity of the fungus in the rice fields. The highest germination of fungal isolates was in the herbicide treatments, thus, they can be used in rice IPM programs.																	1302-0250						2013	15		1				17	22										WOS:000320348300003						
J	Zeng, JP; Wang, Y; Liu, XP				Zeng, Ju-Ping; Wang, Yong; Liu, Xing-Ping			Influence of photoperiod on the development of diapause in larvae and its cost for individuals of a univoltine population of Dendrolimus punctatus (Lepidoptera: Lasiocampidae)	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY												Larvae of Dendrolimus punctatus overwinter in diapause. In the Yangtze River Region, this species is multivoltine at altitudes below 400 m and univoltine above 700 m a.s.l. The photoperiodic response of the univoltine population, investigated at five day lengths (11.5, 12.5, 13.5, 14.5 and 15.5 h) at 27 + 1 degrees C, indicates that D. punctatus is a long-day species. Diapause was induced in 95-100% of the individuals by three short photophases (11.5-13.5 h), while diapause incidence decreased steeply with increase in day length down to 10% at 15.5 h. The critical daylength (CDL = day length resulting in a 50% incidence of diapause) is 14.6 h. When induced by critical or longer photophases (14.5 and 15.5 h), diapause terminated spontaneously, without any change in photoperiod or temperature. Diapause induced at shorter photophases was more intense and not terminated without activation by diapause averting conditions. Larvae in diapause lived for up to 190 d when kept under a 11.5 h photophase during which they remained sensitive to the photoperiodic signal. In transfer experiments, diapause was terminated after an increase in photoperiod, even if it was within the range of diapause inducing photoperiods: from 11.5 h to 13.5 h. This study revealed that the univoltine hill dwelling population of D. punctatus undergoes a facultative diapause. Although potentially multivoltine they are univoltine because of the low temperatures at that altitude.																	1210-5759						2013	110	1					95	101		10.14411/eje.2013.013								WOS:000318038000012						
J	Grill, A; Cerny, A; Fiedler, K				Grill, Andrea; Cerny, Andrea; Fiedler, Konrad			Hot summers, long life: egg laying strategies of Maniola butterflies are affected by geographic provenance rather than adult diet	CONTRIBUTIONS TO ZOOLOGY												Maniola butterflies undergo summer dormancy in dry and hot habitats and deposit their eggs only in early autumn when conditions become more favourable for their offspring. Female individuals of this genus are therefore relatively long-lived. For long-lived butterflies adult diet is of particular importance. We tested if added amino acids in nectar substitute fed to the butterflies affected timing of oviposition, fecundity and longevity. A hundred Maniola females were sampled from Mediterranean and Central European populations and made to oviposit under controlled laboratory conditions. Forty individuals were offered sucrose solution with additional amino acids while the remainder were fed with plain sucrose solution. We found that egg-laying strategies and longevity depended on geographic provenance rather than diet. Supplementary amino acids in adult diet did neither prolong lifetime nor increase total egg production. Maniola females from Sardinia started to lay eggs at least 20 days later relative to Central European M. jurtina and lived three times as long. Mediterranean individuals had on average twice the length of reproductive period and lifespan relative to Central European ones, and individuals of Pannonian origin lived longer than Alpine butterflies. Average total egg numbers were 200-350 eggs per female and did not differ significantly between populations. The fact that oviposition strategy could not be altered through diet may indicate that for univoltine butterflies, like Maniola, diet-quality at the adult stage is less important than endogenous factors, or factors the butterflies are exposed to in an earlier developmental stage than the imago. Oviposition strategy closely matched the climatic conditions that prevail in the geographic regions where these butterflies fly.

Evaluation and improvement of the Community Land Model (CLM4) in Oregon forests	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Ecosystem process models are important tools for determining the interactive effects of global change and disturbance on forest carbon dynamics. Here we evaluated and improved terrestrial carbon cycling simulated by the Community Land Model (CLM4), the land model portion of the Community Earth System Model (CESM1.0.4). Our analysis was conducted primarily in Oregon forests using FLUXNET and forest inventory data for the period 2001-2006. We go beyond prior modeling studies in the region by incorporating regional variation in physiological parameters from > 100 independent field sites in the region. We also compare spatial patterns of simulated forest carbon stocks and net primary production (NPP) at 15 km resolution using data collected from federal forest inventory plots (FIA) from > 3000 plots in the study region. Finally, we evaluate simulated gross primary production (GPP) with FLUXNET eddy covariance tower data at wet and dry sites in the region. We improved model estimates by making modifications to CLM4 to allow physiological parameters (e. g., foliage carbon to nitrogen ratios and specific leaf area), mortality rate, biological nitrogen fixation, and wood allocation to vary spatially by plant functional type (PFT) within an ecoregion based on field plot data in the region. Prior to modifications, default parameters resulted in underestimation of stem biomass in all forested ecoregions except the Blue Mountains and annual NPP was both over-and underestimated. After modifications, model estimates of mean NPP fell within the observed range of uncertainty in all ecoregions (two-sided P value = 0.8), and the underestimation of stem biomass was reduced. This was an improvement from the default configuration by 50% for stem biomass and 30% for NPP. At the tower sites, modeled monthly GPP fell within the observed range of uncertainty at both sites for the majority of the year, however summer GPP was underestimated at the Metolius semi-arid pine site and spring GPP was overestimated at the Campbell River mesic Douglas-fir site, indicating GPP may be an area for further improvement. The low bias in summer maximum GPP at the semi-arid site could be due to seasonal response of V-cmax to temperature and precipitation while overestimated spring values at the mesic site could be due to response of V-cmax to temperature and day length.

The larvae were found all year round, but eggs, pupal cocoons, and adults were found only from March to November. In winter, only the medium second-instar larvae were found, suggesting that they are in diapause state. Seasonal occurrence of each developmental stage in the field indicated that this parasitoid produces more than four generations per year. The life cycle in Toon is substantially similar to that in Hirosaki, in cool-temperate northern Japan, but some of the traits differed geographically. Occurrence of newly formed pupal cocoons was 2 months earlier and length of the season for growth and reproduction was 4 months longer in Toon than in Hirosaki. Appearance of the pupal cocoon is more or less coincident with the period when monthly mean temperatures reach around 10 degrees C. The observed geographical difference in the seasonal life cycle may be due to the difference in local climatic conditions, but not to a difference in seasonal host availability.																	0030-8870	1534-6188				JAN	2013	67	1					105	111		10.2984/67.1.7								WOS:000313999700007

Climatic indices in the interpretation of the phenological phases of the olive in mediterranean areas during its biological cycle	CLIMATIC CHANGE												The present study implemented a regional phenological model that was derived through the growing season index and adapted to a widespread Mediterranean species, the olive (Olea europaea L.). This model considers not only individual phenological events, but also the main vegetative and reproductive phenological phases of the species, in an integrated biological approach. The regional model generally does not need to include specific meteorological variables calculated as weekly or monthly averages which could limit the extrapolation over large areas. The main climatic limitations of the olive cultivation areas in the south Mediterranean at latitudes around 10A degrees (practically speaking, the geographical limits of the olive) are estimated here. This analysis uses information relating to local climatic changes over the last two decades (1990-1999, 2000-2009) to provide interpretations of the temperature, solar radiation rate, and evapotranspiration trends. This has allowed creation of a Mediterranean phenological model adapted to the olive, which presents the contemporary climate requirements during winter and the warm summer season. The climate analysis and comparisons of these two decades has allowed us to reveal a reduction in the index according to the minimum temperature, which has particular consequences in the northern monitoring areas. This phenomenon appears to present new positive scenarios for the future regarding a northward shift of olive cultivation areas, due to the potential enlargement of the growing season in winter. However, negative scenarios can also be foreseen in consideration of the failure to satisfy the minimum chilling requirements in the traditional southern cultivation areas of the olive.

Latitudinal clines in alternative life histories in a geometrid moth	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY												The relative roles of genetic differentiation and developmental plasticity in generating latitudinal gradients in life histories remain insufficiently understood. In particular, this applies to determination of voltinism (annual number of generations) in short-lived ectotherms, and the associated trait values. We studied different components of variation in development of Chiasmia clathrata (Lepidoptera: Geometridae) larvae that originated from populations expressing univoltine, partially bivoltine or bivoltine phenology along a latitudinal gradient of season length. Indicative of population-level genetic differentiation, larval period became longer while growth rate decreased with increasing season length within a particular phenology, but saw-tooth clines emerged across the phenologies. Indicative of phenotypic plasticity, individuals that developed directly into reproductive adults had shorter development times and higher growth rates than those entering diapause. The most marked differences between the alternative developmental pathways were found in the bivoltine region suggesting that the adaptive correlates of the direct development evolve if exposed to selection. Pupal mass followed a complex cline without clear reference to the shift in voltinism or developmental pathway probably due to varying interplay between the responses in development time and growth rate. The results highlight the multidimensionality of evolutionary trajectories of life-history traits, which either facilitate or constrain the evolution of integrated traits in alternative phenotypes.

However, depending on meteorological factors, each year calendar dates of seasonal events considerably differ. The aim of the study - to determine the influence of meteorological factors on phenological phases of ephemeroids in Kamsa botanical-zoological reserve. As the research object was chosen a deciduous forest in Kamsa botanical-zoological reserve. Research of phenological phases was conducted in 1991, 2000, 2006-2013. During the growing season, ephemeroids were recorded once a week: their height, projection coverage and phenological phases were recorded. To find out what meteorological factors had the greatest influence on phenological phases of ephemeroids, a multiple statistical method - principal component analysis was applied. Studies show that among meteorological factors the greatest influence on Anemone nemorosa L. had soil surface temperature, while the least - the amount of rainfall and air temperature. Corydalis solida L. was mainly affected by temperature on the soil surface and at 20 cm depth, air temperature, the amount of precipitation. Ficaria verna Huds was influenced by air temperature, but was not affected by the amount of precipitation, soil temperature at a depth of 20 cm, temperature on the surface of the soil. Gagea lutea L. was mainly affected by temperature on the soil surface and at 20 cm depth, air temperature, but was not affected by the amount of precipitation.																	1822-3230						2013	6	3					164	170										WOS:000357670300029

Reproduction of the Diadematidae sea urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii in a recently colonized area of northern New Zealand	MARINE BIOLOGY RESEARCH												Reproduction of the sea urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii at the Mokohinau Islands (northeast New Zealand) was studied in terms of the gametogenetic cycle and sex ratio, and larval range of thermal tolerance was determined. A comparison with the reproductive patterns in populations located in New South Wales (NSW), the historical range of the species, and Tasmania, where the species has only recently arrived (approximate to 50-60 years ago), was made. Results indicate that C. rodgersii in New Zealand is capable of growing gonads, completing a gametogenetic cycle and producing viable gametes. The timing of this process is similar to the population in Sydney (central NSW), where spawning is probably triggered by the winter solstice and lasts from July to September. The sex ratio was skewed towards females (1.6 females for each male), which may be indicative of the recent arrival of the species in New Zealand. Larvae obtained from this population were able to develop at a measurable rate after 72 h only between 16 degrees C and 25 degrees C. Ambient temperatures during spawning at the Mokohinau Islands (15.7-16.8 degrees C) appear to be at the lower end of the range of temperatures suitable for early larval development.

J	Yokoya, M; Shimizu, H; Higuchi, Y				Yokoya, Masana; Shimizu, Hideyasu; Higuchi, Yukito			Geographical Distribution of Adolescent Body Height with Respect to Effective Day Length in Japan: An Ecological Analysis	PLOS ONE												The height of Japanese youth raised in the northern region tends to be greater than that of youth raised in the southern region; therefore, a geographical gradient in youth body height exists. Although this gradient has existed for about 100 years, the reasons for it remain unclear. Consideration of the nutritional improvement, economic growth, and intense migration that has occurred in this period indicates that it is probably the result of environmental rather than nutritional or genetic factors. To identify possible environmental factors, ecological analysis of prefecture-level data on the body size of 8-to 17-year-old youth averaged over a 13-year period (1996 to 2008) and Japanese mesh climatic data on the climatic variables of temperature, solar radiation, and effective day length (duration of photoperiod exceeding the threshold of light intensity) was performed. The geographical distribution of the standardized height of Japanese adolescents was found to be inversely correlated to a great extent with the distribution of effective day length at a light intensity greater than 4000 lx. The results of multiple regression analysis of effective day length, temperature, and weight (as an index of food intake) indicated that a combination of effective day length and weight was statistically significant as predictors of height in early adolescence; however, only effective day length was statistically significant as a predictor of height in late adolescence. Day length may affect height by affecting the secretion of melatonin, a hormone that inhibits sexual and skeletal maturation, which in turn induces increases in height. By affecting melatonin production, regional differences in the duration of the photoperiod may lead to regional differences in height. Exposure to light intensity greater than 4000 lx appears to be the threshold at which light intensity begins to affect the melatonin secretion of humans who spend much of their time indoors.

Inbreeding and outbreeding depression in geographical parthenogens Heterocypris incongruens and Eucypris virens (Crustacea: Ostracoda)	ITALIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Heterocypris incongruens and Eucypris virens are geographic parthenogens inhabiting temporary ponds. Several authors proposed that, after the last glaciation, asexual lineages would spread throughout Europe more efficiently than sexual ones. The range expansion, that followed metapopulation dynamics characterized by genetic bottlenecks and subsequent inbreeding/outbreeding depression, had strong negative fitness consequences in sexuals. Using controlled crosses we estimated inbreeding and outbreeding depression in the sexual populations of H. incongruens and E. virens and compared the experimental reproduction rate in sexual and asexual females of both species. Inbreeding depression varied according to species and fitness components but, in general, was not significantly different between inbred and outbred crosses. In H. incongruens, inbred crosses produced a higher percentage of resting eggs and had higher fecundity than intrapopulation outbred crosses. Reproduction rate in asexuals of both species was about twice that in sexuals. Our data does not support the hypothesis that sexual populations exhibit inbreeding depression in geographic parthenogens. However, outbreeding depression and the lower efficiency of sexuals in establishing new populations may account for the role of metapopulation dynamics in geographic parthenogenesis of both species.

Spatial Ecology and Habitat Use of the Western Foxsnake (Pantherophis vulpinus) on Squaw Creek National Wildlife Refuge (Missouri)	JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY												Knowledge of movements, habitat use, and resource requirements is critical to designing management strategies for species with a conservation status. For snakes, basic research needed to derive this information is often lacking or insufficient. We used radio telemetry to investigate the spatial ecology and habitat use of 21 adult Western Foxsnakes (Pantherophis vulpinus) during a single activity season at Squaw Creek National Wildlife Refuge in northwest Missouri, near the species' southern range limit. At the landscape level, monitored snakes located their home ranges in lowland areas in association with wet prairies and managed wetlands but avoided agricultural plots and were not observed to occupy upland areas. Snakes were not selective of macrohabitat within their home ranges but selected microhabitats with denser herbaceous vegetation than typically available at random sites, suggesting that snakes were responding mainly to microhabitat features at the home-range level. Unlike many other temperate snake species, P. vulpinus did not exhibit any sexual differences in selection of microhabitats because all snakes appeared to prefer dense vegetative structure. Home-range sizes were relatively large in comparison to many other terrestrial temperate colubrids and seemed to be explained by resource distribution patterns, such as the proximity of hibernacula and oviposition sites to foraging habitat. Movement patterns varied seasonally among sexes with males demonstrating peak movement distances in May and females in July, respectively. Management decisions to minimize habitat manipulations during the snake activity season and protect embankments used for hibernacula and oviposition will likely benefit Foxsnake conservation.																	0022-1511					DEC	2012	46	4					539	548		10.1670/10-111								WOS:000313394400017

THE CONTRIBUTION OF CULEX PIPIENS COMPLEX MOSQUITOES TO TRANSMISSION AND PERSISTENCE OF WEST NILE VIRUS IN NORTH AMERICA	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MOSQUITO CONTROL ASSOCIATION												Mosquitoes within the Culex pipiens complex have been implicated as major vectors of West Nile virus (WNV) in North America due to their seasonal abundance, vector competence and high field infection rates. However, the role of Cx. p. pipiens complex mosquitoes in enzootic amplification of WNV among avian hosts and epidemic transmission to humans varies throughout its geographical distribution. In the northeastern United States, Cx. p. pipiens is recognized as the primary enzootic vector responsible for amplification of virus among wild bird populations. However, because this mosquito is strongly ornithophilic, its role in transmission to humans appears to be more limited in this region. In the north central and Mid-Atlantic States by contrast, Cx. p. pipiens shows an increased affinity for human hosts and has been incriminated as a key bridge vector. In southern regions of the United States, Culex p. quinquefasciatus are more opportunistic feeders, and are thought to be principal enzootic and epidemic vectors. In western regions of the United States where Culex tarsalis predominates, especially in rural areas, Cx. p. pipiens and Cx. p. quinquefasciatus play roles that are more limited and are recognized as secondary vectors. In the southwestern United States Cx. p. quinquefusciatus also appears to be the predominant vector in urban habitats, but only a secondary vector in more rural environs. The direct involvement of Cx. p. pipiens form molestus in WNV transmission is largely unknown, but human-biting Cx. p. pipiens are more likely to have a probability of genetic ancestry with Cx. p. pipiens form molestus. The detection of WNV from overwintering populations of diapausing Cx. p. pipiens and non-diapausing Cx. p. quinquefaciatus and their role in local overwintering of WNV are addressed.																	8756-971X					DEC	2012	28	4		S			137	151		10.2987/8756-971X-28.4s.137								WOS:000312679500019	23401954

Effects of Landscape Composition and Rotation Distance on Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) Abundance in Cultivated Potato	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												Knowledge of the Colorado potato beetle's, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say), relationship to previous potato crops has contributed to the development of a pest management strategy focused upon crop rotation. Previous investigations revealed that potato rotations exceeding 0.4 km were effective in reducing colonization in current season potato. The current study examines the relationship between beetle abundance in potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) and distance from multiple, previous year potato fields in Wisconsin, and integrates information about the influence of natural habitats adjacent to previous season potato. Colorado potato beetle count data were collected in 1998 and 2008 and distance to previous potato, field areas, and landscape classes were estimated using maps from 1997 and 2007. Poisson regression was used to relate counts to combinations of distance and local landscape characteristics calculated for all fields within 1,500 m of sampled potato. In 1998, beetle counts measured in current season potato declined significantly with increasing distance from previous potato fields and field size did not influence these counts. However, there was no relationship between beetle abundance and distance to prior year potatoes in 2008. In both years, increased proportions of surrounding habitats, previously described as preferred for diapause sites (e. g., wooded field boundaries), did not relate significantly to counts. However, grassland habitat was negatively correlated with counts. Results indicate that distance from previous potato remains an important factor to reduce the magnitude of colonization. This analysis further suggests that certain landscape components (e. g., grassland) may influence infestation, which may be useful for refining future integrated pest management programs.																	0046-225X					DEC	2012	41	6					1553	1564		10.1603/EN12128								WOS:000312670000030	23321104

Lynne			Hibernation and seasonal fasting in bears: the energetic costs and consequences for polar bears	JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY												Global warming has the potential to reduce arctic sea ice and thereby increase the length of summer fall fasting when polar bears (Ursus maritimus) lose access to most marine mammals. To evaluate the consequences of such changes, we compared the cost of fasting by polar bears with hibernation by brown bears (U. arctos), American black bears (U. americanus), and polar bears and made projections about tissue reserves polar bears will need to survive and reproduce as fasts become longer. Hibernating polar bears expend energy at the same rate per unit mass as do brown bears and black bears. However, daily mass losses, energy expenditures, and the losses of lean mass are much higher in fasting, active polar bears than in hibernating bears. The average pregnant polar bear living around Hudson Bay during the 1980s and 1990s could fast for 10.0 +/- 2.3 months ((X) over bar +/- SD), and the average lactating female with cubs born during the preceding winter could fast for 4.2 +/- 1.9 months. Thus, some pregnant or lactating females with lower levels of body fat content were already approaching or beyond the constraint of being able to produce cubs and survive the required 8 months of fasting if producing new offspring or 4 months if accompanied by older offspring. Pregnant or lactating females and their dependent offspring have the most tenuous future as global warming occurs. Thus, we predict a significant reduction in productivity with even modest increases in global warming for polar bears living in the very southern part of their range and are concerned about more northern populations depending on their ability to accumulate increasing amounts of fat.

During spring and summer they reproduce clonally and efficiently by parthenogenesis. At the end of summer aphids perceive the shortening of day length which triggers the production of sexual individuals - males and oviparous females - that will mate and lay overwintering cold-resistant eggs. Recent large scale transcriptomic studies allowed the discovery of transcripts and functions such as nervous and hormonal signaling involved in the early steps of detection and transduction of the photoperiodic signal. Nevertheless these experiments were performed under controlled conditions when the photoperiod was the only varying parameter. To characterize the response of aphids under natural conditions, aphids were reared outdoor both in summer and autumn and material was collected to compare their transcriptomic profile using a cDNA microarray containing around 7000 transcripts. Statistical analyses revealed that close to 5% of these transcripts (367) were differentially expressed at two developmental stages of the process in response to the autumnal environmental conditions. Functional classification of regulated transcripts confirmed the putative contribution of the neuro-endocrine system in the process. Furthermore, these experiments revealed the regulation of transcripts involved in juvenile hormone synthesis and signaling pathway, confirming the key role played by these molecules in the reproductive mode switch. Aphids placed under outdoor conditions were confronted to a range of abiotic factors such as temperature fluctuations which was confirmed by the differential expression of an important proportion of heat shock protein transcripts between the two seasons. Finally, this original approach completed the understanding of genetic programs involved in aphid phenotypic plasticity. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Due to geographic variation in photoperiodic response, moths from a northern population, Langfang (39 degrees 32'N, 116 degrees 41'E), enter diapause in response to short daylengths (D strain) while moths from a southern population, Ledong (18 degrees 28'N, 108 degrees 53'E), exhibit no diapause under the same conditions (N strain). In the present study, crosses between the two strains are utilized to evaluate the inheritance of diapause under different photoperiods at temperatures 20, 22 and 25 degrees C. The moths in both reciprocal crosses and backcrosses to D strain showed a clear long-day response, similar to that of the D strain, suggesting that the photoperiodic response controlling diapause in this moth is heritable. The incidences of diapause for all F-1 hybrids were intermediate between those of their parents. However, the incidences of diapause at 20 degrees C in F-1 (N x D) strain were significantly higher than those in F-1 (D x N) strain, indicating that the male parent plays a more important role in the determination of diapause. The N strain also showed a short-day photoperiodic response at the lower temperature of 20 degrees C, indicating that the N strain still has the capability to enter a photoperiodically induced diapause, depending on the rearing temperature. Results from all crosses under photoperiods LD 12:12 or LD 13:11 at 22 degrees C showed that inheritance of diapause in H. armigera did not fit an additive hypothesis and that the capacity for diapause was transmitted genetically in the manner of incomplete dominance with non-diapause characteristic partially dominant over the diapausing. Diapause duration in hybrid pupae was also influenced by their inheritance from both parents. Diapause duration in hybrid pupae was intermediate between those of their parents. These results reveal that both diapause induction and duration are under the control of polygene. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigated the immune response against a large series of M. tuberculosis antigens, including 5 classical and 64 nonclassical (39 DosR regulon-encoded, 4 resuscitation-promoting factor [RPF], and 21 reactivation-associated) antigens in active-pulmonary-tuberculosis (TB) patients. Whole blood from TB patients (n = 34) was stimulated in vitro with M. tuberculosis antigens. Gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) was measured after 7 days of stimulation, using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The majority of the study participants responded to the classical M. tuberculosis antigens TB10.4 (84.8%), early secreted antigenic target-6 kDa (ESAT-6)/CFP-10 (70.6%), and purified protein derivative (PPD) (55.9%). However, only 26.5% and 24.2% responded to HSP65 and Ag85A/B, respectively. Of the 64 nonclassical antigens, 23 (33.3%) were immunogenic (IFN-gamma levels, > 62 pg/ml) and 8 were strong inducers of IFN-gamma (IFN-gamma levels, >= 100 pg/ml). The RPF antigens were the most immunogenic. In addition, we observed distinct cytokine expression profiles in response to several M. tuberculosis antigens by multiplex immunoassay. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 10 (IL-10), and IL-6 were commonly detected at high levels after stimulation with 4/15 latency antigens (Rv0081, Rv2006, Rv2629, and Rv1733c) and were found especially in supernatants of the three strong IFN-gamma inducers (Rv2629, Rv1009, and Rv2389c). IL-8, IL-6, and IL-17 were exclusively detected after stimulation with Rv0574c, Rv2630, Rv1998, Rv054c, and Rv2028c. In conclusion, in active-pulmonary-TB patients, we identified 23 new immunogenic M. tuberculosis antigens. The distinct expression levels of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-10 in response to specific subsets of M. tuberculosis antigens may be promising for the development of immunodiagnostics.																	1556-6811					DEC	2012	19	12					1907	1915		10.1128/CVI.00482-12								WOS:000311848400002	23015647					
J	Spieth, HR; Cordes, R				Spieth, Hubert R.; Cordes, Ralf			Geographic comparison of seasonal migration events of the large white butterfly, Pieris brassicae	ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												1. The multivoltine butterfly Pieris brassicae (Linnaeus) inhabits most climatic zones in Europe and Asia. Its regional populations are adapted to the respective climatic conditions and hibernate in those regions. Yet how these adaptations are stabilised in spite of the species' regular migration events is unclear. 2. In this study, significant differences were found in the preferred flight direction of P. brassicae depending on the season and the butterfly's geographic origin. The individual flight behaviours indicated that flight direction is a heritable character. 3. The bivoltine population from northern Germany undertook a typical return flight in the second generation of the year. This reverse flight was induced by the developmental mode of the caterpillars. A diapause in the pupal stage triggered a northward migration, and a non-diapause a southward migration. 4. In contrast to bivoltine populations, the second generation of multivoltine populations maintained the direction of the hibernating generation. 5. A unique situation was determined for the population from the northern coast of Spain. The North Sea seemed to be a migration barrier that forced an adaptation, with the first generation flying southeastward, and the second generation northeastward. 6. The flight pattern of at least some of the investigated populations suggests that, after their yearly migration, the descendants of a local population are able to reach the home range of their ancestors again.																	0307-6946					DEC	2012	37	6					439	445		10.1111/j.1365-2311.2012.01385.x								WOS:000311697300001						
J	Dalin, P; Nylin, S				Dalin, Peter; Nylin, Soren			Host-plant quality adaptively affects the diapause threshold: evidence from leaf beetles in willow plantations	ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												1. Voltinism of herbivorous insects can vary depending on environmental conditions. The leaf beetle Phratora vulgatissima L. is univoltine in Sweden but will sometimes initiate a second generation in short-rotation coppice (SRC) willow plantations. 2. The study investigated whether increased voltinism by P. vulgatissima in plantations can be explained by (i) rapid life-cycle development allowing two generations, or (ii) postponed diapause induction on coppiced willows. 3. In the field, no difference was found in the phenology or development of first-generation broods between plantations (S. viminalis) and natural willow habitats (S. cinerea). However, the induction of diapause occurred 12 weeks later in SRC willow plantations. 4. Laboratory experiments indicated no genetic difference in the critical day-length for diapause induction between beetles originating from plantations and natural habitats. Development time was unaffected by host-plant quality but critical day-length was prolonged by almost an hour when the beetles were reared on a non-preferred willow species (S. phylicifolia). When reared on new leaves from re-sprouting shoots of recently coppiced willow plants, diapause incidence was significantly less than when the beetles were reared on mature leaves from uncoppiced plants. 5. The study suggests that P. vulgatissima has a plastic diapause threshold influenced by host-plant quality. The use of host-plant quality as a diapause-inducing stimulus is likely to be adaptive in cases where food resources are unpredictable, such as when new host-plant tissue is produced after a disturbance. SRC willows may allow two beetle generations due to longer growing seasons of coppiced plants that grow vigorously.

Antennal sugar sensitivity in the click beetle Agriotes obscurus	PHYSIOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												The occurrence of salt-, sugar-sensitive neurones and a mechanoreceptor neurone in the antennal hair-like gustatory sensilla of the click beetle Agriotes obscurus L. (Coleoptera, Elateridae) is demonstrated using the electrophysiological sensillum tip-recording technique. The stimulating effect of 13 water soluble sugars at 100 mm is tested on the neurones of these sensilla. Sucrose and fructose are the two most stimulating sugars for the sugar-sensitive neurone, evoking almost 30 spikes s-1 at 100 mm. The stimulating effect of arabinose, glucose, mannose, maltose and raffinose is three- to five-fold lower, in the range 5.99.6 spikes s-1. The remaining six sugars, xylose, galactose, rhamnose, cellobiose, trehalose and lactose, have very low (<1 spikes s-1) or no ability to stimulate the sugar-sensitive neurone. Concentration/response curves of the sugar-sensitive neurone to sucrose, fructose and glucose at 0.01100 mm overlap to a large extent in hibernating, cold reactivated and reproductively-active beetles. A remarkable 950% decrease in the number of spikes evoked by 100 mm fructose and 10100 mm sucrose occurs, however, in reproductively-active beetles in June compared with beetles at the beginning of hibernation in October. These findings show that A. obscurus is capable of sensing a wide range sugars via their antennal gustatory sensilla.																	0307-6962					DEC	2012	37	4					345	353		10.1111/j.1365-3032.2012.00849.x								WOS:000311575800008

The levels of variations in Hd1 and Ehd1 of O. rufipogon from Hainan Island were higher than those from Guangdong province, although their polymorphism distribution trends were similar. The haplotype phylogenetic analysis showed that the genetic diversity of O. rufipogon from Hainan Island was richer than that from Guangdong province. The phylogenic networks of individuals based on either Hd1 or Ehd1 or the combination of these genes indicated that the differentiation of O. rufipogon did not occur due to geographic isolation. Our findings suggest that different ecological niches seem to have significant impacts on the genetic differentiation of O. rufipogon populations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Small-scale resource tracking in a population of a long-lived insect	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												How plant-feeding insects distribute themselves and utilize their host plant resources is still poorly understood. Several processes may be involved, and their relative roles may vary with the spatial scale considered. Herein, we investigate small-scale patterns, namely how population density of a gall midge is affected by individual growth form, phenology, and microsite characteristics of its herb host. The long-lived plant individuals vary much with regard to number of shoots, flower abundance, and flowering phenology. This variation is connected to site characteristics, primarily the degree of sun exposure. The monophagous insect galls the flowers of the host plant - an easily defined food resource. It is a poor disperser, but very long-lived; diapausing larvae can stay in the soil for many years. Galls were censused on individual plants during 5 years; from a peak to a low in gall population density. Only a very small fraction of the flowers produced (<0.5%) were galled even in the peak year. Nevertheless, most plant individuals had galls at least 1 year. In a stepwise multiple regression, plant size (number of shoots) was found to be the most important predictor of gall density (galls/flower). However, gall density decreased more than one order of magnitude over the plant size range observed. There was also a weak effect of plant phenology. Early flowering plants had lower gall densities than those starting later. Sun exposure had no direct effect on gall density, but a path analysis revealed indirect effects via the timing of flowering. Gall population change was highly synchronous in different parts of the study area with no significant decrease in synchrony with distance.																	2045-7758					NOV	2012	2	11					2659	2668		10.1002/ece3.378								WOS:000312452400003	23170203

Rising environmental temperature will likely affect life cycle and range of species. To forecast such effects in an odonate, we simulated the continent-wide life cycle distribution pattern and range of a dragonfly applying a dynamic population model. 2. The model was used to investigate how much of the current voltinism patterns and distribution range of the species are correctly predicted by using temperature and day length as the only environmental factors. We forecasted the range and voltinism changes on a European extent for the year 2050 using one GCM (CSIRO) driven by one greenhouse gas emission scenario (b2a) according to the IPCC. 3. The model run lead to 80% correctly predicted distribution range, with a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 55%, the latter because of high error in predicting absence in southern Europe. 4. The projected voltinism ranged from 1 to 2 years per generation in southern latitudes to 5 years in the north. A comparison with field data indicated correct predictions in 50% of all cases, while the other 50% were slight over- or underestimates by half a year per generation. 5. We conclude that the model led to sufficient predictions of range as well as of life cycle pattern in central and northern Europe. Wrong predictions of presence for southern Europe may be caused by factors not recognised in the model, likely competition by con generics, while incorrect voltinism was possibly because of habitat effects. 6. Simulations with increased temperature scenarios implied a future northward shift of the fundamental niche and a decreased development duration towards the northern range.

J	Han, HJ; Yi, MF				Han HaoJun; Yi MingFang			MRI can reveal metabolic changes in lily bulbs in vivo during dormancy release	SCIENCE CHINA-LIFE SCIENCES												The factors influencing dormancy release in lily bulbs strongly affect commercialization success, but the mechanism of dormancy release is still unclear. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect changes in morphology and water status in a living plant bulb and aid in investigating release factors. To evaluate whether MRI could be used to detect intra-bulb metabolic changes during the dormant period in Oriental Lilies (Lilium 'Sorbonne'), a series of MRI and sugar concentration measurements were performed weekly on bulbs stored for 11 weeks at 4A degrees C. The image quality of intra-bulb structure obtained using T (1)-weighted imaging was superior to that obtained using T (2)-weighted imaging and had a higher signal-to-noise ratio (0.97 +/- 0.01). Magnetization transfer ratio values for the bud and basal plate declined during the first eight weeks of cold storage (P > 0.05), and were well correlated with concentration of soluble sugar in the bud (R (2)=0.95) and basal plate (R (2)=0.93). Thus, MRI can serve as a valuable tool for observation and analysis of dynamic morphological and metabolic changes in vivo during dormancy release. This information is potentially useful as a guide in the improvement of horticultural product quality.																	1674-7305	1869-1889				NOV	2012	55	11					1002	1006		10.1007/s11427-012-4394-8								WOS:000311398500009	23124794					
J	Inward, DJG; Wainhouse, D; Peace, A				Inward, Daegan J. G.; Wainhouse, David; Peace, Andrew			The effect of temperature on the development and life cycle regulation of the pine weevil Hylobius abietis and the potential impacts of climate change	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST ENTOMOLOGY												1 The pine weevil Hylobius abietis is widely distributed in the Palaearctic region where it is a major pest. Although predominantly semi-voltine, with a 2-year life cycle, the generation time across its range can vary from 1 to 4 years. The duration of the life cycle and the seasonal timing of weevil activity affect the economic impact and management of this pest, all of which are likely to change in a warming climate. 2 To determine the effect of temperature and tree species on weevil growth and development, laboratory experiments were performed with eggs, larvae, prepupae, pupae and adults, using, as appropriate, the host species Scots pine Pinus sylvestris L. and Sitka spruce Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr. under constant or alternating temperatures. 3 The development rate was linearly related to temperature, with developmental thresholds for eggs, larvae and pupae of 8, 4.5 and 7.3 degrees C, respectively. Day-degrees were estimated for each life stage. Larval development was affected by tree species, being slower on Sitka spruce than on Scots pine, and was faster under alternating than constant temperatures. 4 The development time for prepupae was highly variable, with an apparent facultative prepupal diapause initiated by temperature. The temperature range 2017.5 degrees C marked the transition between median prepupal development times of approximately 25 and 90 days. The prepupal stage may serve to minimize the risk of overwintering mortality in the pupal stage and help to synchronize the life cycle. 5 Larval and adult mass was positively related to developmental temperature, demonstrating an inverse temperature size rule, and weevils were heavier when developing on Scots pine than Sitka spruce. Development in alternating temperatures reduced weevil mass on Scots pine. The influence of temperature on weevil mass is likely to have a positive effect on fecundity and overwintering survival. The effects of climate change on development, voltinism and weevil mass are discussed.																	1461-9555					NOV	2012	14	4					348	357		10.1111/j.1461-9563.2012.00575.x								WOS:000309917900003

CLINAL VARIATION IN SEED TRAITS INFLUENCING LIFE CYCLE TIMING IN ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA	EVOLUTION												Early life-history transitions are crucial determinants of lifetime survival and fecundity. Adaptive evolution in early life-history traits involves a complex interplay between the developing plant and its current and future environments. We examined the plant's earliest life-history traits, dissecting an integrated suite of pregermination processes: primary dormancy, thermal induction of secondary dormancy, and seasonal germination response. We examined genetic variation in the three processes, genetic correlations among the processes, and the scaling of germination phenology with the source populations climates. A spring annual life history was associated with genetic propensities toward both strong primary dormancy and heat-induced secondary dormancy, alone or in combination. Lineages with similar proportions of winter and spring annual life history have both weak primary dormancy and weak thermal dormancy induction. A genetic bias to adopt a spring annual strategy, mediated by rapid loss of primary dormancy and high thermal dormancy induction, is associated with a climatic gradient characterized by increasing temperature in summer and rainfall in winter. This study highlights the importance of considering combinations of multiple genetically based traits along a climatic gradient as adaptive strategies differentiating annual plant life-history strategies. Despite the genetic-climatic cline, there is polymorphism for life-history strategies within populations, classically interpreted as bet hedging in an unpredictable world.

Reconstruction of periodicity of repetitive linear enamel hypoplasia from perikymata counts on imbricational enamel among dry-adapted chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) from Fongoli, Senegal	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY												Periodicity of repetitive linear enamel hypoplasia (rLEH) in apes from high latitudes with single wet and dry seasons annually has not been described. We reconstruct periodicity and duration of rLEH in canine teeth from three recently deceased chimpanzees from Fongoli, Senegal with a marked seven-month dry season. High-resolution dental molds were taken in the field for magnified imaging with digital microscopy. Photomontages allowed counting of perikymata between episodes of rLEH for reconstruction of periodicity and duration of physiological stress. Where rLEH spans the imbricational enamel, the number of events is consistent with years required to form canine imbricational enamel; i.e., periodicity of rLEH seems circannual. We predicted perikymata counts between rLEH events ranging from 52 to 61 based on reported long counts of 76 days. Counts ranged from 29.5 to 44, individual mean of 36.7. This discrepancy could be explained by recurrent stress with a periodicity of 7.28.4 months, or by long counts of 10 days per stria. Neither is supported in the literature. Since we find evidence of rLEH with circannual periodicity, we postulate the existence of non-emergent imbricational striae. Based on evidence that stress at Fongoli recurs annually, we reconstruct stress duration of 23 months, longer than reported for chimpanzees living in other habitats, which we attribute to heat stress and food shortage near shrinking waterholes. We conclude that canine teeth from a small mortality cohort of chimpanzees at Fongoli preserve a faithful record of dry season stress in an extreme environment. Am J Phys Anthropol, 2012.

For populations of high-latitude species, spring phenology often occurs earlier in warmer years and regions. Here we apply a novel approach, a comparison of slope of phenology on temperature over space versus over time, to identify the relative roles of plasticity and local adaptation in generating spatial phenological variation in three interacting species, a butterfly, Anthocharis cardamines, and its two host plants, Cardamine pratensis and Alliaria petiolata. All three species overlap in the time window over which mean temperatures best predict variation in phenology, and we find little evidence that a day length requirement causes the sensitive time window to be delayed as latitude increases. The focal species all show pronounced temperature-mediated phenological plasticity of similar magnitude. While we find no evidence for local adaptation in the flowering times of the plants, geographic variation in the phenology of the butterfly is consistent with countergradient local adaptation. The butterfly's phenology appears to be better predicted by temperature than it is by the flowering times of either host plant, and we find no evidence that coevolution has generated geographic variation in adaptive phenological plasticity.

Geographic variability in response to azinphos-methyl in field-collected populations of Cydia pomonella (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) from Argentina	PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE												BACKGROUND: Resistance to insecticides has been related to application history, genetic factors of the pest and the dynamic within the treated area. The aim of this study was to assess the geographic variation in azinphos-methyl response and the role of esterase and cytochrome P450 monooxygenase enzymes in codling moth populations collected within different areas of the Rio Negro and Neuquen Valley, Argentina. RESULTS: Diapausing field-collected populations showed resistance ratios at the LC50 that were 0.78.7 times higher than that of the susceptible strain. Mean esterase (EST) and cytochrome P450 monooxygenase activities (expressed as a-N min-1 mg-1 prot-1 and pg 7-OHC insect-1 min-1 respectively) were significantly correlated with LD50 values from the field-collected populations. In addition, azinphos-methyl response was associated with the geographic area where the insect population was collected: populations from isolated and more recent productive areas presented significantly lower resistance ratios in comparison with populations from older and more intensive productive areas. CONCLUSION: The populations assayed presented different resistance levels to azinphos-methyl. The response was highly correlated with the orchard's geographic location. EST and ECOD activities were involved in azinphos-methyl response in the given region.

Global Protein Conjugation by Ubiquitin-Like-Modifiers during Ischemic Stress Is Regulated by MicroRNAs and Confers Robust Tolerance to Ischemia	PLOS ONE												Hibernation torpor provides an excellent model of natural tolerance to ischemia. We have previously shown that massive global SUMOylation occurs during hibernation torpor in ground squirrels. We have also shown that overexpression of Ubc9, SUMO-1, or SUMO-2/3 provides protection against ischemic damage in cell lines and cortical neurons exposed to oxygen/glucose deprivation, and in mice exposed to middle cerebral artery occlusion. We have now extended our study to other Ubiquitin-Like-Modifiers (ULMs), which have multiple cellular functions during stress, in order to assess the possibility that they also have roles in tolerance to ischemia. We found that not only SUMO conjugation, but also global protein conjugation by other ULMs including NEDD8, ISG15, UFM1 and FUB1 were significantly increased in the brains of hibernating ground squirrels during torpor. By means of miRNA microarrays of ground squirrel brain samples (from active and torpor phase) we found that the miR-200 family (miR-200a,b,c/miR-141/miR-429) and the miR-182 family (miR-182/miR-183/miR-96) were among the most consistently depressed miRNAs in the brain during the torpor phase as compared to active animals. In addition, we showed that these miRNAs are involved in the expression of various ULM proteins and their global conjugation to proteins. We observed that inhibition of the miR-200 family and/or miR-182 family miRNA activities in SHSY5Y cells increases global protein conjugation by the above ULMs and makes these cells more tolerant to OGD-induced cell death. This is the first report to describe that the natural tolerance to brain ischemia in hibernators is linked to regulation by microRNAs of a broad range of ubiquitin-like modifiers.																	1932-6203					OCT 18	2012	7	10							e47787	10.1371/journal.pone.0047787								WOS:000312384500023	23094087

Effects of rearing conditions, geographical origin, and selection on larval diapause in the Indianmeal moth, Plodia interpunctella	JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE												The Indianmeal moth, Plodia interpunctella (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), is a serious insect pest of stored products, and its late-instar larvae diapause as pre-pupae. Diapause induction in P. interpunctella was investigated for four populations obtained from Modesto, California, U.S.A.; Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada; and two locations from Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Insects were reared at 25 degrees C and 16:8 L:D for 9 days. The larvae were then either continuously maintained under those conditions or transferred to 25 degrees C 8: 16 L:D, 20 degrees C 16:8 L:D, or 20 degrees C 8: 16 L: D, and the percent diapause was recorded. In the experiment with four populations, the highest diapause frequency was observed at 20 degrees C 8:16 L:D. The two Winnipeg populations had significantly higher frequency of diapause than the California populations, indicating the increased frequency of diapause in populations from higher latitudes.																	1536-2442					OCT 17	2012	12								119									WOS:000309994400001	23451807					
J	Mandin, C; Vezina, F				Mandin, Clement; Vezina, Francois			Daily variation in markers of nutritional condition in wintering Black-capped Chickadees Poecile atricapillus	IBIS												The plasma metabolites triglycerides (TRIG) and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BUTY) are used as indices of nutritional condition in migrating birds during refuelling and can provide a measure of relative fattening rates in individual birds. Because non-migratory birds wintering at northern latitudes also fatten on a daily basis to support their overnight fast, blood metabolites could provide a useful tool to measure individual performance in energy acquisition. However, daily patterns of metabolite change may differ between species and could be affected by thermoregulatory requirements. We studied daily variation in TRIG and BUTY over a complete winter in Black-capped Chickadees to determine the pattern of daily and seasonal change in these markers. We also assessed how short-term variation (up to 7 days) in weather parameters that influence heat exchange may affect TRIG and BUTY levels. In contrast to a linear gain of body mass, TRIG increased non-linearly during the day, with a rapid increase in the morning that levelled off in the afternoon, whereas BUTY did not change significantly. Metabolites varied with sampling time and the seasonal change in day length, suggesting higher fat catabolism and fattening rates in mid-winter. TRIG and BUTY also differed between capture sites, possibly due to differences in shelter quality. Weather variation did not affect TRIG levels and had a significant but marginal effect on BUTY, explaining at best 3% of the variation. Our results suggest that these markers can be used as indicators of energy turnover in resident wintering passerines.																	0019-1019					OCT	2012	154	4					791	802		10.1111/j.1474-919X.2012.01262.x								WOS:000310738900012

Although mutations in dozens of genes can affect flowering of A. thaliana in the laboratory, only a handful of such genes vary in natural populations. Chief among these are FRIGIDA (FRI) and FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). Common and rare FRI mutations along with rare FLC mutations explain a large fraction of flowering-time variation in A. thaliana. Here we document flowering time under different conditions in 20 C. rubella accessions from across the species' range. Similar to A. thaliana, vernalization, long photoperiods and elevated ambient temperature generally promote flowering. In this collection of C. rubella accessions, we did not find any obvious loss-of-function FRI alleles. Using mapping-by-sequencing with two strains that have contrasting flowering behaviors, we identified a splice-site mutation in FLC as the likely cause of early flowering in accession 1408. However, other similarly early C. rubella accessions did not share this mutation. We conclude that the genetic basis of flowering-time variation in C. rubella is complex, despite this very young species having undergone an extreme genetic bottleneck when it split from C. grandiflora a few tens of thousands of years ago.

This species has a wide distribution and exists under a wide variety of ecological conditions. It has two ecotypes in Hungary: with either one or two broods per year. It is of particular interest to reveal the main factors driving differentiation patterns in this species. Samples in our study were obtained from five Hungarian and one Transylvanian (Romanian) regions. Enzyme polymorphism, wing characters and male external genitalia were analysed using traditional morphometric methods. Statistical methods were optimized to compare morphological and genetic data. The results of genetic surveys revealed a clear regional pattern of differentiation in M. athalia. Moreover, the results of principal component analysis, Bayesian clustering and the dendrogram all suggested that the regions can be classified into two groups corresponding to the East or West zones of the Carpathian Basin. In contrast, differentiation between the two ecotypes was less expressed in the genetic variation of M. athalia. Results of the analyses conducted on phenotypic variation also suggested a regional pattern for both sets of morphometric characters (wings and external genitalia). At the same time, neither EastWest regional division nor ecotype differentiation was detected in the morphometric studies. In sum, our analyses confirmed that both genetic and phenotypic variations of M. athalia exhibit a regional pattern rather than the differentiation between the two ecotypes.

Prolactin inhibition does not influence horn growth in two wild caprinae species: European mouflon (Ovis orientalis musimon) and Iberian ibex (Capra pyrenaica)	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH												Studies on seasonal horn development and the endocrine mechanism regulating its pattern in wild ruminants are scarce. The aim of this paper was to study the influence of photoperiod and prolactin (PRL) on horn growth in two wild ruminant species: the European mouflon and the Iberian ibex. Eighteen male ibexes and 13 mouflon rams, maintained in captivity, were divided into three groups: a control group, kept under a natural photoperiod (latitude, 40A degrees 25' N); a long-day group, exposed to an artificial photoperiod of 15-h light and 9-h darkness; and a group treated with bromocriptine (BCR; 10 mg twice weekly during spring and summer) to induce hypoprolactinaemia. Horn length growth (HLG) was recorded weekly for 18 months; plasma PRL concentrations were measured twice monthly by radioimmunoassay. In the ibexes of the long-day group, the period of strong horn development during spring-summer was significantly reduced by 2 months compared with the controls. In the mouflons of the long-day group, this same period was significantly increased by 9 months. In the BCR-treated animals, hypoprolactinaemia was observed in both species, but HLG was the same as in the corresponding controls. The present results suggest that the seasonal pattern of horn growth of wild ruminants is primarily modulated by photoperiod in a species-dependent manner. The persistence of resurgence of horn growth during spring in the BCR-induced hypoprolactinaemic animals of both species suggests that annual variations in blood PRL concentration have no effect on seasonal variation in horn growth.

Role of domestic shipping in the introduction or secondary spread of nonindigenous species: biological invasions within the Laurentian Great Lakes	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												The most effective way to manage invasive species is to prevent their introduction via vector regulation. While progress has been made in the management of transoceanic ballast water, domestic vessels operating within smaller geographic regions such as the Laurentian Great Lakes, Mediterranean Sea, North Sea or Baltic Sea are often exempt from regulations. We randomly surveyed unmanaged ballast water moved by domestic vessels within the Laurentian Great Lakes and compared the results with that of exchanged ballast water from transoceanic vessels to assess invasion risk of zooplankton transported by these two types of vessels. Total abundance and species richness were significantly different between the two vessel types with mean abundance being two magnitudes greater, and species richness being threefold higher in domestic vessels compared with transoceanic vessels. Abundance of restricted taxa cumulatively the Great Lakes' indigenous and nonindigenous species (NIS) which do not occur in all five lakes was also significantly higher in domestic vessels (mean densities were 24 170 and 3421 individuals per m3 for domestic and transoceanic vessels, respectively), whereas the abundance of NIS did not differ between vessels (median densities of 2015 and 850 individuals per m3, respectively). We documented 89 species transported by domestic vessels of which 31 had restricted distribution and eight were NIS. While most NIS were already established in all five lakes, Cercopagis pengoi, a NIS of global concern, and Nitokra hibernica have not been identified from Lake Superior, and both were sampled from ballast water destined for discharge in Lake Superior. Beside the risk of spread of NIS between lakes, domestic shipping can act as a vector for homogenization of indigenous taxa, with at least 21 native species (99 events) being moved outside their historical distribution. Synthesis and applications. Our study indicates that management of invasive species should consider ecological, not geographical or political boundaries. Domestic vessels operating within a limited geographic region have high potential to introduce or spread species with restricted distribution, demonstrating importance of intraregional ballast water management. Results presented here should interest policy makers and environmental managers who seek to reduce invasion risk.

J	Prabhakaran, PM; Sheeba, V				Prabhakaran, Priya M.; Sheeba, Vasu			Sympatric Drosophilid Species melanogaster and ananassae Differ in Temporal Patterns of Activity	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL RHYTHMS												The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has long served as a model system for circadian rhythm research. Various aspects of its genetic, molecular, and circuit-level properties are the subject of investigation, based on which several circadian behaviors and their neuronal controls have been unraveled. In an attempt to address the question of functional significance of circadian organization using a comparative approach, we studied activity/rest rhythm of wild-caught D. melanogaster (DM) and its close relative, Drosophila ananassae (DA). We compared features of the rhythm such as the ability to anticipate morning and evening transitions, presence or absence of morning-associated or evening-associated activity peaks, and phase of these peaks in both species. We found that these 2 sympatric species are different from each other in several aspects of activity/rest rhythm. Unlike DM, which showed a distinct bimodal activity pattern with both morning and evening peaks and a midday interval of relative inactivity under a 12:12-h light/dark regime, DA exhibited unimodal activity with a predominant morning peak, restricting most of its activity to the light phase with no apparent "siesta" during midday. While daytime sleep levels were not different between the 2 species, DA exhibited significantly lesser nighttime activity and higher, more consolidated sleep. This predominant morning activity of DA was also reflected in persistence and phasing of the morning peak under a range of photoperiods. Both under long and short days, the morning peak was the most dominant and persistent peak of DA, whereas the evening peak was more dominant in DM. In addition, DA had a significantly faster circadian clock and more consolidated activity compared with DM. Hence, we hypothesize that these recently diverged sympatric species of fruit flies occupy distinct temporal niches due to differences in their underlying circadian clocks and speculate that they occupy different spatial microenvironments in the wild.					sheeba, vasu/0000-0003-2924-7130												0748-7304	1552-4531				OCT	2012	27	5					365	376		10.1177/0748730412458661								WOS:000309127400003	23010659

Cold hardening is presumed to start during diapause development to ensure the successful overwintering of this species. To address this hypothesis, we compared cold tolerance between non-diapausing and diapausing females. We measured supercooling point (SCP) and survival to acute cold stress by exposing the mites at a range of sub-zero temperatures (from -4 to -28 degrees C for 2 h). The mean SCPs of non-diapausing and diapausing females were -19.6 +/- 0.5 and -24.7 +/- 0.3 degrees C respectively, and freezing killed the mites. Diapausing females were significantly more cold tolerant than non-diapausing ones, with LT50 of -19.7 and -13.3 degrees C. respectively. Further, we also examined the effects of cold acclimation (10 d at 0 or 5 degrees C) in non-diapausing and diapausing females. Our findings indicated that diapause decreased SCP significantly, while cold acclimation had no effect on the SCP except for non-diapausing females that were acclimated at 5 degrees C. Acclimation at 5 degrees C enhanced survival to acute cold stress in diapausing and non-diapausing females, with LT50 of -22.0 and -17.1 degrees C, respectively. Altogether, our results indicate that T. urticae is a chill tolerant species, and that diapause and cold acclimation elevate cold hardiness in this species. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Sniegula, S; Nilsson-Ortman, V; Johansson, F				Sniegula, Szymon; Nilsson-Ortman, Viktor; Johansson, Frank			Growth Pattern Responses to Photoperiod across Latitudes in a Northern Damselfly	PLOS ONE												Background: Latitudinal clines in temperature and seasonality impose strong seasonal constraints on ectotherms. Studies of population differentiation in phenotypic plasticity of life history traits along latitudinal gradients are important for understanding how organisms have adapted to seasonal environments and predict how they respond to climate changes. Such studies have been scarce for species with a northern distribution. Methodology/Principle Finding: Larvae of the northern damselfly Coenagrion johanssoni originating from semivoltine central, partivoltine northern, and partivoltine northernmost Swedish populations were reared in the laboratory. To investigate whether larvae use photoperiodic cues to induce compensatory growth along this latitudinal gradient, larvae were reared under two different photoperiods corresponding to a northern and southern latitude. In addition, field adult size was assessed to test the strength of possible compensatory growth mechanisms under natural conditions and hatchling size was measured to test for maternal effects. We hypothesized that populations originating from lower latitudes would be more time constrained than high-latitude populations because they have a shorter life cycle. The results showed that low-latitude populations had higher growth rates in summer/fall. In general northern photoperiods induced higher growth rates, but this plastic response to photoperiod was strongest in the southernmost populations and negligible in the northernmost population. During spring, central populations grew faster under the southern rather than the northern photoperiod. On the other hand, northern and northernmost populations did not differ between each other and grew faster in the northern rather than in the southern photoperiod. Field sampled adults did not differ in size across the studied regions. Conclusion/Significance: We found a significant differentiation in growth rate across latitudes and latitudinal difference in growth rate response to photoperiod. Importantly, growth responses measured at a single larval developmental stage in one season may not always generalize to other developmental stages or seasons.

A tropical bird can use the equatorial change in sunrise and sunset times to synchronize its circannual clock	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												At higher latitudes, most organisms use the periodic changes in day length to time their annual life cycle. At the equator, changes in day length are minimal, and it is unknown which cues organisms use to synchronize their underlying circannual rhythms to environmental conditions. Here, we demonstrate that the African stonechat (Saxicola torquatus axillaris)-an equatorial songbird-can use subtle solar cues for the annual timing of postnuptial moult, a reliable marker of the circannual cycle. We compared four groups that were kept over more than 3 years: (i) a control group maintained under constant equatorial day length, (ii) a 12-month solar time group maintained under equatorial day length, but including a simulation of the annual periodic change in sunrise and sunset times (solar time), (iii) a 14-month solar time group similar to the previous group but with an extended solar time cycle and (iv) a group maintained under a European temperate photoperiod. Within all 3 years, 12-month solar time birds were significantly more synchronized than controls and 14-month solar time birds. Furthermore, the moult of 12-month solar time birds occurred during the same time of the year as that of free-living Kenyan conspecifics. Thus, our data indicate that stonechats may use the subtle periodic pattern of sunrise and sunset at the equator to synchronize their circannual clock.

The clock functions by generating endogenous rhythms that can be entrained to the external 24-h day-night cycle, enabling organisms to optimally time biochemical processes relative to dawn and dusk. In recent years, computational models based on differential equations have become useful tools for dissecting and quantifying the complex regulatory relationships underlying the clock's oscillatory dynamics. However, optimizing the large parameter sets characteristic of these models places intense demands on both computational and experimental resources, limiting the scope of in silico studies. Here, we develop an approach based on Boolean logic that dramatically reduces the parametrization, making the state and parameter spaces finite and tractable. We introduce efficient methods for fitting Boolean models to molecular data, successfully demonstrating their application to synthetic time courses generated by a number of established clock models, as well as experimental expression levels measured using luciferase imaging. Our results indicate that despite their relative simplicity, logic models can (i) simulate circadian oscillations with the correct, experimentally observed phase relationships among genes and (ii) flexibly entrain to light stimuli, reproducing the complex responses to variations in day-length generated by more detailed differential equation formulations. Our work also demonstrates that logic models have sufficient predictive power to identify optimal regulatory structures from experimental data. By presenting the first Boolean models of circadian circuits together with general techniques for their optimization, we hope to establish a new framework for the systematic modelling of more complex clocks, as well as other circuits with different qualitative dynamics. In particular, we anticipate that the ability of logic models to provide a computationally efficient representation of system behaviour could greatly facilitate the reverse-engineering of large-scale biochemical networks.				; Millar, Andrew/G-2423-2012	Watterson, Steven/0000-0002-2750-6410; Millar, Andrew/0000-0003-1756-3654; Ghazal, Peter/0000-0003-0035-2228; Parton, Andrew/0000-0002-8562-0975												1742-5689					SEP 7	2012	9	74					2365	2382		10.1098/rsif.2012.0080								WOS:000306750500031	22499125

Complexity of the heat-soluble LEA proteome in Artemia species	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY D-GENOMICS & PROTEOMICS												The brine shrimp Artemia is a well known stress tolerant invertebrate found on most continents. Under certain conditions females produce cysts (encysted gastrulae) that enter diapause, a state of obligate dormancy. During developmental formation of diapause embryos several different types of stress proteins accumulate in large amounts, including the late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins. In this study we used a combination of heterologous group 3 LEA antibodies to demonstrate that the heat-soluble proteome of the cysts contains up to 12 distinct putative group 3 LEA proteins that complement the group 1 LEA proteins found previously. Most antibody-positive, heat-soluble proteins were larger than 50 kDa although antibody positive proteins of 20-38 kDa were also detected. Both nuclei and mitochondria had distinct complements of the putative group 3 LEA proteins. A few small group 3 LEA proteins were induced by cycles of hydration-dehydration along with one protein of about 62 kDa. The expression of group 3 LEA proteins, unlike members of group 1, was not restricted to encysted diapause embryos. Three to five putative group 3 LEA proteins were expressed in gravid females and in larvae. Cysts of different species from various geographic locations had distinct complements of group 3 LEA proteins suggesting rapid evolution of the LEA proteins or differences in the type of group 3 Lea genes expressed. Our results demonstrate the potential importance of group 3 LEA proteins in embryos and other life cycle stages of this animal extremophile. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Dispersal of Neonate Timber Rattlesnakes (Crotalus horridus) in the Southeastern Coastal Plain	JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY												In colder climates, survival of neonate Timber Rattlesnakes (Crotalus horridus) following dispersal relies heavily on conspecific scent trailing and the ability to locate suitable communal hibernacula. Less is known regarding populations in the southern portion of their range where they are more likely to den solitarily in ephemeral overwintering sites. On 6 August 2009, we captured a post-parturient female Timber Rattlesnake with a litter of 23 neonates in a hardwood thicket within a Longleaf Pine (Pinus palustris) forest in southwestern Georgia. Fourteen of the neonates were radio-tracked to examine their movements and activity range overlap as they dispersed from the natal site. Snakes were tracked for periods of 1-110 days, daily for the first three weeks and at least three times per week thereafter. Dispersal distances increased over time, and overlap of activity ranges was minimal, potentially reducing intraspecific competition between litter mates. Neonates were located predominantly beneath clumps of vegetation or beside coarse woody debris (62.4%), in hardwood tree branches (31.6%), or just off the ground in vegetation or on top of course woody debris (6.0%). Selection of appropriate cover structure may aid in reducing susceptibility to predation.																	0022-1511					SEP	2012	46	3					417	422		10.1670/10-126								WOS:000309617600020

Effects of temperature and photoperiod on lure display and glochidial release in a freshwater mussel	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Freshwater mussels use an array of strategies to transfer their parasitic larvae (glochidia) to fish hosts. We examined the effects of temperature, photoperiod, and female gravidity on mantle lure display and conglutinate release by Ligumia subrostrata (Say, 1831) in 2 laboratory experiments. In the 1st experiment, we examined the use of these strategies in 4 temperature treatments (5, 15, 25, 35 degrees C) and 3 photoperiods (10:14, 12:12, and 14:10 h light: dark). In the 2nd experiment, we observed infection strategies under ambient conditions with flow-through pond water. Water temperature appeared to be the primary cue governing use of these strategies. Lure display occurred over a protracted period, but the highest display frequency occurred between similar to 11 and 20 degrees C. Lure display declined rapidly above this range and ceased altogether >28 degrees C. Release of conglutinates increased coincident with the decrease in lure display but, at ambient temperatures, occurred over a protracted period similar in duration to lure display. Females that were not gravid at the beginning of the experiment did not display lures, and gravid females whose gills were flushed of glochidia displayed for only a short period during which frequency of display was much lower than gravid individuals. Ligumia subrostrata exhibits a temperature-mediated switch between alternate host strategies. We present evidence that lure display is a primary strategy for host infection and conglutinate release is a secondary, bet-hedging strategy to reduce wastage of glochidia that ultimately must be cleared from the gills at the end of the reproductive season.																	2161-9565					SEP	2012	31	3					775	786		10.1899/11-082.1								WOS:000309905100008

In endemic countries vivax malaria causes significant morbidity and its mortality is becoming more widely appreciated, drug-resistant strains are increasing in prevalence, and an increasing number of reports indicate that P. vivax is capable of breaking through the Duffy-negative barrier long considered to confer resistance to blood stage infection. Absence of robust in vitro propagation limits our understanding of fundamental aspects of the parasite's biology, including the determinants of its dormant hypnozoite phase, its virulence and drug susceptibility, and the molecular mechanisms underlying red blood cell invasion. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we report results from whole genome sequencing of five P. vivax isolates obtained from Malagasy and Cambodian patients, and of the monkey-adapted Belem strain. We obtained an average 70-400 X coverage of each genome, resulting in more than 93% of the Sal I reference sequence covered by 20 reads or more. Our study identifies more than 80,000 SNPs distributed throughout the genome which will allow designing association studies and population surveys. Analysis of the genome-wide genetic diversity in P. vivax also reveals considerable allele sharing among isolates from different continents. This observation could be consistent with a high level of gene flow among parasite strains distributed throughout the world. Conclusions: Our study shows that it is feasible to perform whole genome sequencing of P. vivax field isolates and rigorously characterize the genetic diversity of this parasite. The catalogue of polymorphisms generated here will enable large-scale genotyping studies and contribute to a better understanding of P. vivax traits such as drug resistance or erythrocyte invasion, partially circumventing the lack of laboratory culture that has hampered vivax research for years.

JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY												Larvae of Tipula paludosa (leatherjackets) are pests of grassland and cereals, and important prey items for a range of farmland birds. Their population dynamics from year to year have been the subject of study, but within-generation dynamics have received much less attention. The duration and occurrence of instars and size of the population is important to both pest management and bird conservation. Leatherjackets were collected monthly from four grass fields over five generations (October to September). Count data were analysed for sources of variability and used to estimate the timing and duration of instars and population changes over a single generation. Instar durations were correlated with temperature. From the first to third instars, sample counts were strongly influenced by the location of the site and the generation. Fourth instar larvae showed a similar decline in numbers across all sites and generations. The duration and timing of first to third instars was more variable than that of the fourth instar, but there was limited evidence that this was influenced by temperature. Only the durations of the third and fourth instars were correlated. The population decline from April to September coincided with the onset of the fourth instar. Our results show that the factors influencing leatherjacket numbers change over the life cycle, but by the fourth instar, these are biotically driven. The predictability of its numerical decline indicates defined windows for crop damage and availability as prey. The stability of its timing suggests that day length may synchronize the annual cycle. Fixed timing of the fourth instar will have important consequences for the timing of crop damage and the conservation of farmland birds as climate changes.																	0931-2048					SEP	2012	136	8					605	613		10.1111/j.1439-0418.2011.01696.x								WOS:000307054000006

Novel cotton germplasm with host plant resistance to twospotted spider mite	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH												Host plant resistance to twospotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae Koch) in cotton is desirable to reduce crop damage, as well as to reduce or eliminate pesticide use targeted at this pest. A range of Gossypium genotypes were evaluated over two crop seasons and their resistance identified in terms of spider mite population development, leaf damage and effect on cotton yield and fibre quality. There were low to moderate numbers of spider mites on Gossypium hirsutum L. race lines and a Gossypium barbadense L. cultivar and extremely low numbers in accessions of Gossypium arboreum L., Gossypium thurberi Tod. and Gossypium trilobum (DC.) Skovst. compared with commercial cultivars. Mites reduced lint yield of the three G. hirsutum genotypes (Sicot 71, Siokra 24 and 81024-15) but had no significant effect on yield of the two G. arboreum genotypes, BM13H and Roseum A(2)56 in either season. Yield loss was related to leaf area damaged by mites. BM13H, Roseum A(2)56 and Sipima 280 were classified as mite-resistant, in terms of low mite numbers, low amount of leaf damage per mite and low yield loss per mite. In addition, the genotypes of G. thurberi (GOS5310), G. trilobum (GOS5332) and G. hirsutum race line (TX111) were also defined as mite-resistant, in terms of low mite numbers, low amount of leaf damage per mite, although there are no yield data because these genotypes are photoperiod sensitive and did not flower during the experiments. These mite-resistant genotypes can be candidates for the development of mite-resistant upland cotton cultivars. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the past, we have developed such a model called ALOMYSYS for a single grass weed species. The objective of the present paper was to extend the monospecific emergence model to a multi-specific weed flora, by removing a few non-generic processes (e.g. maternal effects on dormancy and germination) and by adapting the germination sub-model to a larger diversity of species. The model is based on a daily simulation of weed seedbank mortality, seasonal dormancy variations, germination and pre-emergent growth until seedling emergence, in interaction with cropping systems and environmental conditions. In order to parameterize the model for numerous and contrasting species, we developed an innovative approach consisting in estimating 25 parameters from easily accessible species traits or from empirical expert knowledge. Relationships were established between seed traits (e.g. seed coat thickness, mass or shape) and seed mortality rates, dormancy levels, speed of germination as well as pre-emergent mortality. Base temperature for germination and dates of dormancy variations were related to usual dates of the species emergence in fields, obtained from expert knowledge. The generic model structure and the trait-parameter relationships make it possible to simulate a wide diversity of weed species and to predict their response to a large range of cropping systems. Thanks to a daily time-step and the integration of the interactions with soil and climatic conditions, FLORSYS permits to optimize the choice of cultural techniques for weed management, as a function of field characteristics and previous technical operations. For instance, the model was used to compare the emergence of different weed species depending on tillage, in interaction with the preceding technical operations. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The SHORT-ROOT protein acts as a mobile, dose-dependent signal in patterning the ground tissue	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												A key question in developmental biology is how cellular patterns are created and maintained. During the formation of the Arabidopsis root, the endodermis, middle cortex (MC), and cortex are produced by periclinal cell divisions that occur at different positions and at different times in root development. The endodermis and cortex arise continuously from the periclinal divisions of cells that surround the quiescent center (QC) at the tip of the root. The MC arises between days 7 and 14 from periclinal divisions of the endodermis. The divisions that produce the middle cortex begin in the basal region of the root meristem away from the QC and then spread apically and circumferentially around the root. Although the transcription factor SHORT-ROOT (SHR) is required for both of these divisions, the mechanism that determines where and when SHR acts to promote cell division along the longitudinal axis of the root is unknown; SHR is present along the entire length of the root tip, but only promotes periclinal divisions at specific sites. Here we show that the abundance of the SHR protein changes dynamically as the root develops, and that the pattern of cell division within the endodermis is sensitive to the dose of this protein: high levels of SHR prevent the formation of the MC, whereas intermediate levels of SHR promote MC formation. These results provide a mechanism for the longitudinal patterning of the endodermis, and represent the first example in plants of a mobile transcription factor whose function (activator or repressor) depends upon concentration.

Development was studied at 12, 15, 23, 25, 29, 33, and 35 degrees C. Eggs of both species did not hatch at 12 degrees C. Nymphal survival was poor at 15 degrees C for O. naivashae, and at 33 degrees C and 35 degrees C for O. thripoborus. Total development time of males and females decreased with increasing temperature. Based on a linear degree-day (DD) model, lower threshold temperatures for egg and nymphal development were estimated to be 9.4 and 10.2 degrees C for O. thripoborus, and 11.3 and 11.8 degrees C for O. naivashae. Thermal requirements for these stages were 73.8 and 191.1 DD, and 65.2 and 168.2 DD, respectively. Adult reproduction was studied at 15, 19, 25, and 33 degrees C. Highest lifetime fecundities for O. thripoborus and O. naivashae were found at 25 degrees C. At 15 degrees C, half of the O. thripoborus females oviposited, whereas O. naivashae females only produced infertile eggs. At 33 degrees C, however, most of the O. naivashae females produced eggs, whereas O. thripoborus females did not oviposit. Our observations suggest that O. thripoborus is adapted to a slightly cooler temperature range as compared with O. naivashae. The complementarity of both predators in terms of their temperature adaptation opens possibilities for their use in biological control programs at different times of the season.

Adults of the M form of An. gambiae persist through the long dry season, when no surface waters are available, by increasing their maximal survival from 4 weeks to 7 months. Dry season diapause (aestivation) presumably underlies this extended survival. Diapause in adult insects is intrinsically linked to depressed reproduction. To determine if reproduction of the Sahelian M form is depressed during the dry season, we assessed seasonal changes in oviposition, egg batch size, and egg development, as well as insemination rate and blood feeding in wild caught mosquitoes. Results from xeric Sahelian and riparian populations were compared. Oviposition response in the Sahelian M form dropped from 70% during the wet season to 20% during the dry season while the mean egg batch size among those that laid eggs fell from 173 to 101. Correspondingly, the fraction of females that exhibited gonotrophic dissociation increased over the dry season from 5% to 45%, while a similar fraction of the population retained developed eggs despite having access to water. This depression in reproduction the Sahelian M form was not caused by a reduced insemination rate. Seasonal variation in these reproductive parameters of the riparian M form population was less extreme and the duration of reproductive depression was shorter. Blood feeding responses did not change with the season in either population. Depressed reproduction during the dry season in the Sahelian M form of An. gambiae provides additional evidence for aestivation and illuminates the physiological processes involved. The differences between the Sahelian and riparian population suggest an adaptive cline in aestivation phenotypes between populations only 130 km apart. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Prolonged pupal dormancy is associated with significant fitness cost for adults of Rhagoletis cerasi (Diptera: Tephritidae)	JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY												In temperate areas, dormancy (diapause and/or quiescence) enables herbivorous insect species to persist and thrive by synchronizing growth and reproduction with the seasonal phenology of their host plants. Within-population variability in dormancy increases survival chances under unpredictable environmental changes. However, prolonged dormancy may be costly, incurring trade-offs in important adult fitness traits such as life span and reproduction. We used the European cherry fruit fly. Rhagoletis cerasi, a stenophagous, univoltine species that overwinters in the pupal stage for usually one or more years to test the hypotheses that prolonged dormancy of pupae has trade-offs with body size, survival and reproduction of the resulting adults. We used two geographically isolated populations of R. cerasi to compare the demographic traits of adults obtained from pupae subjected to one or two cycles of warm-cold periods (annual and prolonged dormancy respectively). Regardless of population, adults from pupae that experienced prolonged dormancy were larger than counterparts emerging within 1 year. Prolonged dormancy did not affect adult longevity but both lifetime fecundity and oviposition were significantly decreased. Extension of the life cycle of some individuals in R. cerasi populations in association with prolonged dormancy is likely a bet-hedging strategy. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Lehmann, P; Lyytinen, A; Sinisalo, T; Lindstrom, L				Lehmann, Philipp; Lyytinen, Anne; Sinisalo, Tuula; Lindstrom, Leena			Population dependent effects of photoperiod on diapause related physiological traits in an invasive beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata)	JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY												Organisms undergoing latitudinal range expansion face a change in the photoperiod which can lead to a mismatch between the timing of seasonal changes in physiological and life history traits with seasonal environmental changes. This mismatch can lead to lowered survival, for example, due to unsynchronized diapause timing. Successful range expansion even in recent introductions requires that organisms which use the photoperiod for seasonal predictions should show interpopulational differences in photoperiodic responses at different latitudes, as the photoperiod is a function of latitude. We investigated among population differences in photoperiodic responses of life history and physiological traits linked to diapause in the invasive beetle Leptinotarsa decemlineata. Beetles from a northern marginal and a southern European population were reared under short day (12:12 L:D) and long day (18:6 L:D) photoperiods. Both populations reacted similarly to the short day photoperiod. Their abdominal total lipid content increased and water content decreased which suggests that the beetles prepared for diapause. This was also indicated by low mortality during diapause. In the long day photoperiod large interpopulational differences were found, the southern population ceased lipid accumulation after 5 days, while the northern population continued lipid accumulation as beetles in the short day photoperiod. This indicates that the northern population has a longer critical photoperiod than the southern one. Abdominal total lipid stores in 10 day old beetles were shown to be predominantly composed of neutral lipids (85%), most likely representing storage triacylglycerols. Fatty acid profiles of both the neutral lipids and the phospholipids showed large shifts during the first 10 day of adult life, predominantly in the fractions of 18:0, 18:1 omega 9, 18:2 omega 6 and 18:3 omega 3. Although the degree of unsaturation increased with age, it was not higher in diapausing than non-diapausing beetles. This indicates that this species does not increase diapause related cold tolerance via homeoviscous adaptation, and might have developed other means to cope with suboptimal temperatures, such as behavioral adaptations.

Factors Influencing the Ranging Behavior of Chacma Baboons (Papio hamadryas ursinus) Living in a Human-Modified Habitat	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY												The introduction and eradication of alien invasive plant species potentially alters feeding and spatial ecology of wild primates. We investigated whether the removal of an important dietary resource for wild chacma baboons (Papio hamadryas ursinus), black wattle (Acacia mearnsii), from a nature reserve would result in longer daily path lengths (DPLs) and greater movement toward other resources, specifically alternative black wattle stands outside the reserve, agricultural plots, and sleeping and geophagy sites. We fitted a juvenile male baboon with a self-releasing GPS collar to track the focal troop's movements on Wildcliff Nature Reserve and adjacent properties, located in the Western Cape, South Africa, from January 25, 2010 to January 18, 2011. During this time, Working for Water, an environmental conservation initiative of the South African Department of Water Affairs, removed black wattle from the baboons' home range. We estimated monthly home range (5.30-20.58 km(2)) and DPL (1.7-11.7 km) and quantified the baboons' use of five dominant vegetation types. Our vegetation use-availability analysis indicated that the troop preferred black wattle, Afromontane forests, and, to a lesser extent, pasture, but used agricultural plots and fynbos less than expected by availability. With increasing black wattle removal in the core area, the troop traveled further toward distant sources of black wattle, using sleeping sites out of their core area to accommodate such long day journeys. A general linear model indicated that movement to black wattle stands, as well as changing sleeping sites, day length, and both spring and winter seasons all significantly increased DPL. We suggest the influence that alien invasive species and their eradication has on ranging behavior should be a consideration in primate conservation and management policies.

(Lepidoiptera: Plutellidae): climate change may modify pest incidence levels	BULLETIN OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH												Temperature is considered to be an important abiotic factor influencing insect reproduction. Despite the importance of Plutella xylostella L. (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae) as a pest of brassicaceous crops worldwide, the effects of temperature on its reproduction are not well understood. We evaluated the effect of constant temperatures ranging from 10 to 32.5 degrees C on the reproduction of P. xylostella and developed an oviposition model for the species. The model combined temperature-dependent parameters of total fecundity, age-specific oviposition rate and age-specific survival. Additionally, we modelled population growth as a function of temperature. The estimated parameters allowed us to discuss the possible consequences of global warming on P. xylostella distribution. Temperature affected the length of pre-oviposition after adult emergence, oviposition period, longevity, total fecundity and egg viability. The model predicted that both daily egg production and length of oviposition period decreased at temperatures below 15 degrees C and above 25 degrees C. Population growth increased linearly with temperature in a range from 10 degrees C to 25 degrees C; however, the model predicted a reduction in population growth at temperatures above 28.6 degrees C. Data suggested that temperature plays a critical role in P. xylostella reproduction, and subtle differences in average temperature could have an impact on its population growth. This is especially important in the context of global climate change, which in turn could alter the distribution and abundance of the pest in some regions of the world.

It was found in Napa County, California, in 2009, and it has subsequently been recorded in an additional nine counties, despite an ongoing eradication programme. The present study aimed to assess prospectively its potential geographical distribution and relative abundance in California and the continental U.S.A. A subsidiary goal was to provide explanation for timing control measures. 2 Data from the European literature were used to formulate and parameterize a holistic physiologically-based demographic model for L. botrana. This model was linked to an extant mechanistic model of grapevine phenology, growth and development that provides the bottom-up effects of fruiting phenology, age and abundance on L. botrana dynamics. Fruit age affects larval developmental rates, and has carryover effects on pupal development and adult fecundity. Also included in the model were the effects of temperature on developmental, survival and fecundity rates. 3 Observed daily weather data were used to simulate the potential distribution of the moth in California, and the continental U.S.A. The relative total number of pupae per vine per year was used as the metric of favourability at all locations. The simulation data were mapped using grass gis (). 4 The model predicts L. botrana can spread statewide with the highest populations expected in the hotter regions of southern California and the lower half of the Central Valley. In the U.S.A., areas of highest favourability include south Texas, and much of the southeast U.S.A. 5 The effects of a warmer climate on pest abundance were explored by increasing observed mean temperatures 2 degrees and 3 degrees C. L. botrana abundance is expected to increase in northern California and in the agriculturally rich Central Valley but to decrease in the hot deserts of southern California where summer temperatures would approach its upper thermal limit. 6 Analysis of the timing of mating disruption pheromone for control of L. botrana suggests the greatest benefit would accrue by targeting adults emerging from winter diapause pupae and the flight of first summer adults.

The role of gene flow asymmetry along an environmental gradient in constraining local adaptation and range expansion	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY												Theoretically, asymmetric gene flow along an environmental gradient can limit species range expansion by keeping peripheral populations from locally adapting. However, few empirical studies have examined this potentially fundamental evolutionary mechanism. We address this possibility in the cricket Allonemobius socius, which exist along a season-length gradient where the probability of producing a single generation per year (univoltinism) increases with latitude. As the probability of univoltinism increases northwards, populations are expected to hedge their bets by producing a greater proportion of diapause eggs when exposed to a mild diapause cue. However, gene flow from southern populations may disrupt local adaptation in the north by reducing the proportion of diapause eggs (expected to be 100% in pure univoltine environments). This may limit range expansion along the northern periphery where A.socius compete with A.fasciatus, a sister species that exhibits an invariant diapause-only egg-laying strategy. To assess the potential for range limitation, we examined diapause incidence (the proportion of diapause eggs produced under diapause conditions), gene flow symmetry and population structure across nine A.socius populations. We found that gene flow was asymmetric and biased northwards towards the periphery. Furthermore, peripheral populations that inhabited pure univoltine environments produced numerous nondiapause eggs (a southern, bivoltine diapause phenotype), which we assume to be a suboptimal phenotype. These patterns suggest that asymmetric gene flow along the gradient constrains adaptation in peripheral populations, potentially constraining species range expansion.																	1010-061X					AUG	2012	25	8					1676	1685		10.1111/j.1420-9101.2012.02552.x								WOS:000306402800021	22694151					
J	Potdar, S; Sheeba, V				Potdar, Sheetal; Sheeba, Vasu			Large Ventral Lateral Neurons Determine the Phase of Evening Activity Peak across Photoperiods in Drosophila melanogaster	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL RHYTHMS												The dual-oscillator model, originally proposed as a mechanism for how vertebrates adapt to seasonal changes, has been invoked to explain circadian entrainment in Drosophila melanogaster. Distinct subsets of neurons have been designated as "morning" and "evening" oscillators that function as regulators of rhythmic activity/rest behavior. Some studies have led to a model in which a subset of 8 "morning" cells (4 bilaterally located small ventral lateral neurons) and another subset of approximately 130 "evening" cells exert different levels of dominance within the circadian circuit in different seasons. However, many studies propose a more integrative neuronal network, with the whole network orchestrating activity/rest rhythms in different seasons, as opposed to hierarchical dominance among neurons. Within the circadian network, our understanding of the role of the large ventral lateral neurons (l-LNv) has thus far been limited to conveying light information to the clocks and as light-activated neurons mediating arousal. In support of the framework of a more distributed model, we report an important circadian clock-related role for the l-LNv in electrical activity-dependent phasing of the evening peak across a range of photoperiods. Further, we propose a model in which l-LNv enable adaptation to seasonal changes by regulating the phase of the evening peak. Additionally, we demonstrate a hitherto unknown role for the small ventral lateral neurons (s-LNv) in the arousal circuit, thus showing that neuronal function is flexible such that certain neurons can play more than one role in distinct circuits.

Photic Sensitivity for Circadian Response to Light Varies with Photoperiod	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL RHYTHMS												The response of the circadian system to light varies markedly depending on photic history. Under short day lengths, hamsters exhibit larger maximal light-induced phase shifts as compared with those under longer photoperiods. However, effects of photoperiod length on sensitivity to subsaturating light remain unknown. Here, Syrian hamsters were entrained to long or short photoperiods and subsequently exposed to a 15-min light pulse across a range of irradiances (0-68.03 mu W/cm(2)) to phase shift activity rhythms. Phase advances exhibited a dose response, with increasing irradiances eliciting greater phase resetting in both conditions. Photic sensitivity, as measured by the half-saturation constant, was increased 40-fold in the short photoperiod condition. In addition, irradiances that generated similar phase advances under short and long days produced equivalent phase delays, and equal photon doses produced larger delays in the short photoperiod condition. Mechanistically, equivalent light exposure induced greater pERK, PER1, and cFOS immunoreactivity in the suprachiasmatic nuclei of animals under shorter days. Patterns of immunoreactivity in all 3 proteins were related to the size of the phase shift rather than the intensity of the photic stimulus, suggesting that photoperiod modulation of light sensitivity lies upstream of these events within the signal transduction cascade. This modulation of light sensitivity by photoperiod means that considerably less light is necessary to elicit a circadian response under the relatively shorter days of winter, extending upon the known seasonal changes in sensitivity of sensory systems. Further characterizing the mechanisms by which photoperiod alters photic response may provide a potent tool for optimizing light treatment for circadian and affective disorders in humans.

J	Sadakiyo, S; Ishihara, M				Sadakiyo, Shou; Ishihara, Michihiro			The role of host seed size in mediating a latitudinal body size cline in an introduced bruchid beetle in Japan	OIKOS												A wide variety of animals show latitudinal cline in body size, which can be caused not only by abiotic factors such as temperature but also by biotic ones such as diet quality. In seed feeding insects, adult body size is affected by seed size. Therefore, seed size may be an important factor to explain the latitudinal cline in body size if the seed size also shows a latitudinal cline. In the present study, we detected a latitudinal cline in body size of an alien bruchid, Acanthoscelides pallidipennis, which was introduced into Japan from North America with its host plant Amorpha fruticosa. In 13 out of 24 populations that we collected in Japan, A. fruticosa seeds were infested with A. pallidipennis. Both body size of A. pallidipennis and host seed weight increased with latitude in the infested populations, but not in the non-infested populations. There was a significant positive correlation between body size and seed weight in both field observation and laboratory experiment. In a common environmental condition, there was no significant difference in body size among three latitudinally different populations. Our results show that the latitudinal cline in adult body size of A. pallidipennis across a non-native range could be explained by the latitudinal cline in seed weight of A. fruticosa, but not by genetic differentiation among populations.																	0030-1299					AUG	2012	121	8					1231	1238		10.1111/j.1600-0706.2011.19593.x								WOS:000306355700005

ZmCCT and the genetic basis of day-length adaptation underlying the postdomestication spread of maize	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Teosinte, the progenitor of maize, is restricted to tropical environments in Mexico and Central America. The pre-Columbian spread of maize from its center of origin in tropical Southern Mexico to the higher latitudes of the Americas required postdomestication selection for adaptation to longer day lengths. Flowering time of teosinte and tropical maize is delayed under long day lengths, whereas temperate maize evolved a reduced sensitivity to photoperiod. We measured flowering time of the maize nested association and diverse association mapping panels in the field under both short and long day lengths, and of a maize-teosinte mapping population under long day lengths. Flowering time in maize is a complex trait affected by many genes and the environment. Photoperiod response is one component of flowering time involving a subset of flowering time genes whose effects are strongly influenced by day length. Genome-wide association and targeted high-resolution linkage mapping identified ZmCCT, a homologue of the rice photoperiod response regulator Ghd7, as the most important gene affecting photoperiod response in maize. Under long day lengths ZmCCT alleles from diverse teosintes are consistently expressed at higher levels and confer later flowering than temperate maize alleles. Many maize inbred lines, including some adapted to tropical regions, carry ZmCCT alleles with no sensitivity to day length. Indigenous farmers of the Americas were remarkably successful at selecting on genetic variation at key genes affecting the photoperiod response to create maize varieties adapted to vastly diverse environments despite the hindrance of the geographic axis of the Americas and the complex genetic control of flowering time.

Climate change represents a potential threat to mountain fauna. Nevertheless, information on ecophysiological limits of individual species is scarce. We studied the lower thermal limits of four species representing the prevailingly mountain Holarctic butterfly genus Erebia. We measured the cold tolerance of hibernating larvae, namely the supercooling point (SCP) and the lower lethal temperature (LLT). Three mountain species were freeze avoiding, with various levels of SCP (-8 to 22 degrees C), and LLT close to SCP. The only exception was lowland E. medusa, whose caterpillars were freeze tolerant with LLT (-21 degrees C) slightly below its SCP (-17 degrees C). Surprisingly, LLT was highest in the alpine E. tyndarus and lowest in E. medusa inhabiting lower altitudes with higher mean winter temperatures. We explain the observed reversed altitudinal cline in cold hardiness by the buffering function of snow cover in the hibernacula of caterpillars that is strong at high mountains but irregular, unpredictable and thus unreliable in lowlands.

The evolution of alternative developmental pathways: footprints of selection on life-history traits in a butterfly	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY												Developmental pathways may evolve to optimize alternative phenotypes across environments. However, the maintenance of such adaptive plasticity under relaxed selection has received little study. We compare the expression of life-history traits across two developmental pathways in two populations of the butterfly Pararge aegeria where both populations express a diapause pathway but one never expresses direct development in nature. In the population with ongoing selection on both pathways, the difference between pathways in development time and growth rate was larger, whereas the difference in body size was smaller compared with the population experiencing relaxed selection on one pathway. This indicates that relaxed selection on the direct pathway has allowed life-history traits to drift towards values associated with lower fitness when following this pathway. Relaxed selection on direct development was also associated with a higher degree of genetic variation for protandry expressed as within-family sexual dimorphism in growth rate. Genetic correlations for larval growth rate across sexes and pathways were generally positive, with the notable exception of correlation estimates that involved directly developing males of the population that experienced relaxed selection on this pathway. We conclude that relaxed selection on one developmental pathway appears to have partly disrupted the developmental regulation of life-history trait expression. This in turn suggests that ongoing selection may be responsible for maintaining adaptive developmental regulation along alternative developmental pathways in these populations.

Transcript profiling reveals mechanisms for lipid conservation during diapause in the mosquito, Aedes albopictus	JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY												The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, is a medically important invasive species whose geographic distribution has expanded dramatically during the past 20 years, and one of the key elements of its success is its capacity to survive long distance transport as a diapausing pharate first instar larva, encased within the chorion of the egg. We report that pharate larvae entering diapause are larger and contain 30% more lipid than their nondiapausing counterparts. To improve our understanding of the molecular regulation of lipid metabolism during diapause, we assessed the relative mRNA abundance of 21 genes using qRT-PCR. Elevated expression of lipid storage droplet protein 2 during embryonic development likely contributes to the higher amounts of lipid we noted in diapausing individuals. The conservation of lipids during diapause is reflected in downregulation of genes involved in lipid catabolism, including lipase 2, lipase 3, lipase 4, acyl-CoA dehydrogenase 4, and isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase. Two genes involved in fatty acid synthesis and modification, Delta(9)-desaturase, and fatty acyl-CoA elongase, were both upregulated in diapausing pharate larvae, suggesting roles for their gene products in generating unsaturated fatty acids to enhance membrane fluidity at low temperatures and generating precursors to the surface hydrocarbons needed to resist desiccation, respectively. Together, the results point to substantial distinctions in lipid metabolism within the embryo as a consequence of the diapause program, and these differences occur both before the actual onset of diapause as well as during the diapause state.

J	Ramirez, AHM; Jhala, AJ; Singh, M				Ramirez, Analiza H. M.; Jhala, Amit J.; Singh, Megh			Germination and Emergence Characteristics of Common Beggar's-Tick (Bidens alba)	WEED SCIENCE												Common beggar's-tick is an annual weed commonly found in citrus groves in Florida. A series of laboratory and greenhouse experiments were conducted to determine the germination response of common beggar's-tick to various environmental factors that influence seed survival, germination, and dormancy. The results suggest that common beggar's-tick germinated over a wide range of temperatures (15 to 40 C) and in both alternating light and dark and dark conditions. New seeds (collected in 2010) germinated better than the old seeds (collected in 2007) at 15/10 C; however, at temperatures above 35 C, the old seeds germinated better. The highest germination was 95% at 25 to 30 C with old seeds compared to 78 to 86% at 20 to 30 C with new seeds. Germination of common beggar's-tick was inhibited at osmotic potential above -0.6 MPa and salt concentrations of 320 mM. Highest germination in common beggar's-tick was found under neutral conditions (pH 7); germination decreased sharply under increasing acidity and alkalinity. Emergence decreased as depth of sowing increased, with greatest germination (89 to 91%) occurring when sown at the surface (0 cm) regardless of seed age. No germination was observed when seeds were buried at 10 cm. Results of this study suggest that favorable temperature and soil pH, and adequate moisture in Florida ensures the germination and continued presence of common beggar's-tick.

Seasonal Photoperiods Alter Developmental Time and Mass of an Invasive Mosquito, Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae), Across Its North-South Range in the United States	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY												The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus (Skuse), is perhaps the most successful invasive mosquito species in contemporary history. In the United States, Ae. albopictus has spread from its introduction point in southern Texas to as far north as New Jersey (i.e., a span of approximate to 14 degrees latitude). This species experiences seasonal constraints in activity because of cold temperatures in winter in the northern United States, but is active year-round in the south. We performed a laboratory experiment to examine how life-history traits of Ae. albopictus from four populations (New Jersey [39.4 degrees N], Virginia [38.6 degrees N], North Carolina [35.8 degrees N], Florida [27.6 degrees N]) responded to photoperiod conditions that mimic approaching winter in the north (short static daylength, short diminishing daylength) or relatively benign summer conditions in the south (long daylength), at low and high larval densities. Individuals from northern locations were predicted to exhibit reduced development times and to emerge smaller as adults under short daylength, but be larger and take longer to develop under long daylength. Life-history traits of southern populations were predicted to show less plasticity in response to daylength because of low probability of seasonal mortality in those areas. Males and females responded strongly to photoperiod regardless of geographic location, being generally larger but taking longer to develop under the long daylength compared with short day lengths; adults of both sexes were smaller when reared at low larval densities. Adults also differed in mass and development time among locations, although this effect was independent of density and photoperiod in females but interacted with density in males. Differences between male and female mass and development times was greater in the long photoperiod suggesting differences between the sexes in their reaction to different photoperiods. This work suggests that Ae. albopictus exhibits sex-specific phenotypic plasticity in life-history traits matching variation in important environmental variables.

Evolution of critical day length for diapause induction enables range expansion of Diorhabda carinulata, a biological control agent against tamarisk (Tamarix spp.)	EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS												In classical weed biological control, small collections of arthropods are made from one or a few sites in the native range of the target plant and are introduced to suppress the plant where it has become invasive, often across a wide geographic range. Ecological mismatches in the new range are likely, and success using the biocontrol agent may depend on postrelease evolution of beneficial life history traits. In this study, we measure the evolution of critical day length for diapause induction (day length at which 50% of the population enters dormancy), in a beetle (Diorhabda carinulata) introduced into North America from China to control an exotic shrub, Tamarix spp. Beetle populations were sampled from four sites in North America 7 years after introduction, and critical day length was shown to have declined, forming a cline over a latitudinal gradient At one field site, decreased critical day length was correlated with 16 additional days of reproductive activity, resulting in a closer match between beetle life history and the phenology of Tamarix. These findings indicate an enhanced efficacy and an increasingly wider range for D. carinulata in Tamarix control.																	1752-4571					JUL	2012	5	5			SI		511	523		10.1111/j.1752-4571.2012.00262.x								WOS:000306271700009	22949926

Seasonal Abundance and Population Structure of Chinavia hilaris and Nezara viridula (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) in Georgia Farmscapes Containing Corn, Cotton, Peanut, and Soybean	ANNALS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												Stink bugs are economically important pests that damage a wide range of crops in the southeastern United States. Stink bug feeding on developing cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) bolls may result in reduced yield and loss of fiber quality; similarly, feeding on developing soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] pods can reduce yield and seed quality. During 2009 and 2010, the seasonal abundance and reproductive biology of Chinavia hilaris (Say) and Nezara viridula (L.) were investigated in replicated 1.62-2.83-ha farmscapes containing equal proportions of corn (Zea mays L.), cotton, peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.), and soybean. Crops were sampled weekly by using whole plant examinations in corn and sweep net sampling in cotton, peanut, and soybean. In 2010 only, adults were dissected to rate their reproductive development, and nymphs were classified to instar. No C. hilaris adults or nymphs ever were observed in corn; however, nymphs were observed in cotton and soybean during late September with peak abundance occurring just after the autumnal equinox. The peak of late-instar nymphs was followed within 2 wk by a peak of nonreproductive adults. More adults were observed in soybean than cotton. In contrast, N. viridula nymphs and adults were found across all crops and had multiple generations throughout the growing season. Results from this study indicate that C. hilaris and N. viridula are different in voltinism, phenology, and use of hosts. These data provide knowledge of stink bug biology and population ecology at the landscape level and are useful for designing and implementing stink bug management programs.																	0013-8746					JUL	2012	105	4					582	591		10.1603/AN12008								WOS:000306075200010

OIKOS												Genetic differentiation and phenotypic plasticity in growth rates along latitudinal gradients may benefit our understanding of latitudinal compensating mechanisms in life history patterns. Here we explore latitudinal compensatory growth mechanisms with respect to photoperiod in northern and southern populations of two damselfly species, Coenagrion puella and C. pulchellum. In addition we compared size of field-collected adults from southern and northern populations. Eggs from females in copulating tandems were collected at two or three localities for each species in each geographic region. Eggs were transported to the laboratory and the experiment started when the eggs hatched. The role of photoperiod on the expression of larval growth rate was evaluated under controlled laboratory conditions. Both species had lower growth rate when reared in the northern photoperiod, which is counter to expectations if species use photoperiodic cues to trigger compensatory growth. Instead, both species displayed countergradient variation in growth rates, which probably enable northern populations to compensate for the shorter growth season in the north. The smaller size of field-collected adults from northern populations also supports the view that these species compensate for the shorter growth season by investing in growth and development but accomplish this at the expense of decreased final size.

Niche models tell half the story: spatial context and life-history traits influence species responses to global change	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim While niche models are typically used to assess the vulnerability of species to climate change, they have been criticized for their limited assessment of threats other than climate change. We attempt to evaluate this limitation by combining niche models with life-history models to investigate the relative influence of climate change and a range of fire regimes on the viability of a long-lived plant population. Specifically, we investigate whether range shift due to climate change is a greater threat to an obligate seeding fire-prone shrub than altered fire frequency and how these two threatening processes might interact. Location Australian sclerophyll woodland and heathland. Methods The study species is Leucopogon setiger, an obligate seeding fire-prone shrub. A spatially explicit stochastic matrix model was constructed for this species and linked with a dynamic niche model and fire risk functions representing a suite of average fire return intervals. We compared scenarios with a variety of hypothetical patches, a patch framework based upon current habitat suitability and one with dynamic habitat suitability based on climate change scenarios A1FI and A2. Results Leucopogon setiger was found to be sensitive to fire frequency, with shorter intervals reducing expected minimum abundances (EMAs). Spatial decoupling of fires across the landscape reduced the vulnerability of the species to shortened fire frequencies. Shifting habitat, while reducing EMAs, was less of a threat to the species than frequent fire. Main conclusions Altered fire regime, in particular more frequent fires relative to the historical regime, was predicted to be a strong threat to this species, which may reflect a vulnerability of obligate seeders in general. Range shifts induced by climate change were a secondary threat when habitat reductions were predicted. Incorporating life-history traits into habitat suitability models by linking species distribution models with population models allowed for the population-level evaluation of multiple stressors that affect population dynamics and habitat, ultimately providing a greater understanding of the impacts of global change than would be gained by niche models alone. Further investigations of this type could elucidate how particular bioecological factors can affect certain types of species under global change.				publicationpage, cmec/B-4405-2017; Ooi, Mark/A-4779-2012; publist, CMEC/C-3010-2012	Ooi, Mark/0000-0002-3046-0417; 												0305-0270					JUL	2012	39	7					1266	1277		10.1111/j.1365-2699.2012.02690.x								WOS:000305452500006

JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY												Subitaneous eggs from an euryhaline calanoid copepod Acartia tonsa were challenged by changes in salinity within the range from full strength salinity, down to zero and up to > 70 psu. Egg volume changed immediately, increasing from 2.8 x 10(5) mu m(3) at full strength salinity (35 psu) to 3.8 x 10(5) mu m(3) at 0 psu and back to its initial volume when gradually being returned to full strength salinity. Egg osmolality followed the molality of the surrounding water when challenged within a salinity range from 2 to 50 psu. Egg respiration was not affected when eggs kept at 35 psu was exposed to low salinity (2 psu). These results suggest that eggs are unable to regulate their volume or osmolality when challenged with changes in salinity. Gradual changes in salinity from 35 to 2 psu and back did not harm the eggs (embryos), since the hatching success remained unaffected by such changes in salinity. In contrast, extreme hyper-saline conditions (76 psu) made the eggs implode and killed the embryo. We propose that the embryo is protected from salinity stress by its plasma membrane and that water exchange driven by osmosis is restricted to the perivitelline space of the egg, which acts as a perfect osmometer in the salinity range of 5-35 psu. We hypothesize further that the embryo is able to keep its volume and osmolality constant due to the impermeability of the inner plasma membrane of the egg or by a combination of osmoregulation and reduced permeability of the inner plasma membrane.

J	Felix, MA; Duveau, F				Felix, Marie-Anne; Duveau, Fabien			Population dynamics and habitat sharing of natural populations of Caenorhabditis elegans and C. briggsae	BMC BIOLOGY												Background: The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a major model organism in laboratory biology. Very little is known, however, about its ecology, including where it proliferates. In the past, C. elegans was mainly isolated from human-made compost heaps, where it was overwhelmingly found in the non-feeding dauer diapause stage. Results: C. elegans and C. briggsae were found in large, proliferating populations in rotting plant material (fruits and stems) in several locations in mainland France. Both species were found to co-occur in samples isolated from a given plant species. Population counts spanned a range from one to more than 10,000 Caenorhabditis individuals on a single fruit or stem. Some populations with an intermediate census size (10 to 1,000) contained no dauer larvae at all, whereas larger populations always included some larvae in the pre-dauer or dauer stages. We report on associated micro-organisms, including pathogens. We systematically sampled a spatio-temporally structured set of rotting apples in an apple orchard in Orsay over four years. C. elegans and C. briggsae were abundantly found every year, but their temporal distributions did not coincide. C. briggsae was found alone in summer, whereas both species co-occurred in early fall and C. elegans was found alone in late fall. Competition experiments in the laboratory at different temperatures show that C. briggsae out-competes C. elegans at high temperatures, whereas C. elegans out-competes C. briggsae at lower temperatures. Conclusions: C. elegans and C. briggsae proliferate in the same rotting vegetal substrates. In contrast to previous surveys of populations in compost heaps, we found fully proliferating populations with no dauer larvae. The temporal sharing of the habitat by the two species coincides with their temperature preference in the laboratory, with C. briggsae populations growing faster than C. elegans at higher temperatures, and vice at lower temperatures.																	1741-7007					JUN 25	2012	10								59	10.1186/1741-7007-10-59								WOS:000307349300001	22731941

A Comparison of Four Geographic Sources of the Biocontrol Agent Prokelisia marginata (Homoptera: Delphacidae) Following Introduction Into a Common Environment	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												As part of a biological control program against Spartina alterniflora Loisel. (smooth cordgrass), we simultaneously released populations of the planthopper Prokelisia marginata (van Duzee) from four geographic areas in each of five replicate field sites in the Willapa Bay estuary in Washington State. The four sources (California, Georgia, Virginia, and Rhode Island) have varying climate and seasonal regimes. We expected local adaptations would affect performance in the new environment. Using vacuum sampling, we measured population densities in spring and fall for 2 yr after release. In addition, we measured the timing of spring emergence through bi-weekly surveys of the number of nymphs residing in overwintering sites (curled leaves of senesced Spartina culms) versus on live green shoots. The observed sequence of emergence GA>CA>VA>RI was consistent with the hypothesis that this insect responds to a photoperiod cue for emergence timing. The four populations also differed in their reproductive capacity as measured by the increase in population densities over the summer months. Overall, the California and Rhode Island populations had higher population growth than those from Virginia and Georgia. Our results suggest that the climate and seasonal adaptations of biocontrol agents should be carefully considered as they can affect the performance and phenology in the new range. At the same time, it is noteworthy that all four populations were capable of establishing and growing, indicating a degree of resiliency for populations experiencing a rapid change in climate.																	0046-225X					JUN	2012	41	3					448	454		10.1603/EN11243								WOS:000305475600005	22732601

Theoretical models postulate that thermal specialization should be favored either when little environmental variation is experienced within generations or when among-generation variation is small relative to within-generation variation. To test these predictions, we studied six temperate species of damselflies differing in latitudinal distribution. We developed a computer model simulating how organisms experience environmental variation (accounting for diapause and voltinism) and performed a laboratory experiment assaying thermal sensitivities of growth rates. The computer model showed opposing latitudinal trends in among-and within-generation thermal variability: within-generation thermal variability decreased toward higher latitudes, whereas relative levels of among-generation thermal variability peaked at midlatitudes (where a shift in voltinism occurred). The growth experiment showed that low-latitude species were more thermally generalized than mid- and high-latitude species, supporting the prediction that generalists are favored under high levels of within-generation variation. Northern species had steeper, near-exponential reaction norms suggestive of thermal specialization. However, they had strikingly high thermal optima and grew very slowly over most of the thermal range they are expected to experience in the field. This observation is at present difficult to explain. These results highlight the importance of considering interactions between life history and environmental variation when deriving expectations of thermal adaptation.																	0012-9658	1939-9170				JUN	2012	93	6					1340	1352										WOS:000305296600012	22834375

Cold tolerance is often highest in winter, as a result of diapause and cold acclimation, and low during the active summer stages. In some blood-feeding ectoparasites, offspring provisioning determines cold tolerance through all the non-feeding, off-host stages. Large size increases survival in the cold, but so far seasonal variation in within-female offspring size has not been associated with offspring cold tolerance. The deer ked (Lipoptena cervi) reproduces on cervids from autumn to spring. Newborn pupae drop off the host, facing frosts without any acclimation. We examined cold tolerance through 4 seasons and from birth to adulthood by means of short- and long-term frost exposure. We expected females to produce more tolerant offspring in winter than in spring. Large spring pupae survived prolonged frosts better than did small winter pupae. Thus more tolerant offspring were not produced when the temperature outside the host is at its lowest. Unexpectedly, the freezing points were -20 degrees C or below all year round. We showed that high cold tolerance is possible without acclimation regardless of life stage, which presumably correlates with other survival characteristics, such as the starvation resistance of free-living ectoparasites.

Differential effects of short term winter thermal stress on diapausing tiger swallowtail butterflies (Papilio spp.)	INSECT SCIENCE												It is generally thought that insects inhabiting lower latitudes are more severely impacted by changes in their thermal environment than are high latitude species. This is attributed to the wider range of temperatures to which high-latitude species are exposed. By contrast, low-latitude species have typically evolved in more thermally stable environments with a narrower range of temperature variation. However, deviation from this pattern can occur and here we report that under variable winter conditions a higher latitude species may be more sensitive to thermal variation than its lower latitude sister species. Using split broods, we examined the survival and adult emergence success of diapausing pupae of Papilio canadensis and P. glaucus, as well as a unique, recombinant hybrid population (late-flight) to short periods of mid-winter cold and heat stress. Our results indicate that the higher latitude, univoltine populations (P. canadensis and late-flights) exhibit lower pupal survival than the lower latitude, facultative diapauser (P. glaucus) for all mid-winter thermal stress treatments, both high and low. Size differences alone do not appear to account for the observed differences in survival or metabolic costs in these three phenotypes, as late-flight individuals are similar in size to P. glaucus. We attribute the observed differences in survival and weight loss to potential metabolic differences and variation in the intensity of diapause, in addition to divergent adaptation to winter precipitation levels (e.g. snow cover) and the influences this may have on microhabitat temperature moderation.																	1672-9609	1744-7917				JUN	2012	19	3					277	285		10.1111/j.1744-7917.2011.01477.x								WOS:000304346200001

In the present study, photoperiodic diapause induction and diapause intensity of S. montelus populations from Jiamusi (46 degrees 37'N), Beijing (40 degrees 15'N), Zibo (36 degrees 48'N), Fangxian (32 degrees 36'N), Wuhan (30 degrees 33'N) and Huaihua (27 degrees 33'N) were characterized at 25 degrees C. Logistic regression analysis revealed a significant population x hours of light interaction, confirming that photoperiodic responses varied among populations. The critical photoperiod was positively correlated with latitude and increased toward the north at a rate of about 1 h for each 6.67 degrees of latitude. Survival analyses indicated that survival time of diapausing pupae before adult eclosion differed significantly among populations at 25 degrees C and 16 : 8 L : D h. The mean duration of pupal diapause was also positively correlated with latitude. Our study reveals geographic variation in the critical photoperiod for diapause induction and in diapause intensity of S. montelus. These results provide useful information for our general understanding about seasonal adaptation in insects and may also be used to predict how geographic populations respond to climate warming.

As a consequence of geographical variation in photoperiodic response, moths from Nanchang (28 degrees 46'N, 115 degrees 50'E) enter diapause in response to short day-lengths (D strain), even at the high temperatures whereas moths from Ledong (18 degrees 47'N, 108 degrees 89'E) exhibit almost no diapause under the same conditions (N strain). In the present study, crosses between the two strains are used to evaluate the inheritance of diapause under different photoperiods at temperatures of 22, 25 and 28 degrees C. The moths, both reciprocal crosses and backcrosses, show a clear long-day response, similar to that of the D strain, suggesting that the photoperiodic response controlling diapause in this moth is heritable. However, the critical day-length for induction of diapause is shorter in hybrids than in the D strain. The N strain also shows a short-day photoperiodic response at the lower temperature of 22 degrees C, indicating that the N strain still has the capacity to enter a photoperiodically-induced diapause, depending on the rearing temperature. The incidence of diapause in all crosses is highest with D strain fathers or grandfathers and lowest with N strain fathers or grandfathers, indicating that the male parent has significantly more influence on the incidence of diapause of subsequent progeny than the female. The results obtained from all crosses under LD 12 : 12 h or LD 13 : 11 h photocycles at 25 degrees C show that inheritance of diapause in O. furnacalis does not fit an additive hypothesis and that the capacity for diapause is transmitted genetically in the manner of incomplete dominance.																	0307-6962					JUN	2012	37	2					185	191		10.1111/j.1365-3032.2011.00810.x								WOS:000304091500011

Here we used 19 microsatellite markers to assay genetic diversity across 89 georeferenced samples from putatively semi-isolated areas throughout the Republic of Ireland and we also genotyped 27 red grouse from Scotland using the same markers. The genetic variation within Ireland was low in comparison to previously published data from Britain and the sample of Scottish red grouse, and comparable to threatened European grouse populations of related species. Irish and Scottish grouse were significantly genetically differentiated (F-ST = 0.07, 95% CI = 0.04-0.10). There was evidence for weak population structure within Ireland with indications of four distinct genetic clusters. These correspond approximately to grouse populations inhabiting suitable habitat patches in the North West, Wicklow Mountains, Munster and Cork, respectively, although some admixture was detected. Pair-wise F-ST values among these populations ranged from 0.02 to 0.04 and the overall mean allelic richness was 5.5. Effective population size in the Munster area was estimated to be 62 individuals (95% CI = 33.6-248.8). Wicklow was the most variable population with an AR value of 5.4 alleles/locus. Local (Munster) neighbourhood size was estimated to 31 individuals corresponding to an average dispersal distance of 31 km. In order to manage and preserve Irish grouse we recommend that further fragmentation and destruction of habitats need to be prevented in conjunction with population management, including protection of the integrity of the existing population by refraining from augmenting it with individuals from mainland Britain to maximise population size.

TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES												White-nose syndrome (WNS) is an emerging disease of hibernating bats probably caused by a pathogenic fungus, Geomyces destructans. The fungus has dispersed rapidly in the Northeastern United States and Canada and is presently a serious risk to hibernating bats of the mid-southern United States. Our objectives were to investigate how the environmental factors of temperature and resources impact the physiology of bats and apply this to explore possible effects of the fungus G. destructans on bats. Using a dynamic, physiologically based model parameterized for little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus), we found that the survival region defined in terms of minimal and maximal cave temperatures and bat lipid reserve levels exhibits plasticity as a function of cave temperature. During the pre-hibernation period, constellations of increased availability of fall and winter prey, reduced energy expenditure and lipogenic factors provide fat deposition in hibernator species that engender survival throughout the hibernation period. The model-derived survival region is used to demonstrate that small increases in lipid reserves allow survival under increasing maximum temperatures, which provides flexibility of bat persistence at the higher cave temperature ranges that may occur in the Southern United States. Antipodally, the lower-temperature survival range is bounded with minimum temperatures. Our results suggest that there is an environmental distinction between survival of bats in Southern and Northern US states, a relationship that could prove very important in managing WNS and its dispersal.																	1865-1674					JUN	2012	59	3					269	278		10.1111/j.1865-1682.2011.01268.x								WOS:000302622100010	22044513

Mutation at the circadian clock gene EARLY MATURITY 8 adapts domesticated barley (Hordeum vulgare) to short growing seasons	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												The circadian clock is an autonomous oscillator that produces endogenous biological rhythms with a period of about 24 h. This clock allows organisms to coordinate their metabolism and development with predicted daily and seasonal changes of the environment. In plants, circadian rhythms contribute to both evolutionary fitness and agricultural productivity. Nevertheless, we show that commercial barley varieties bred for short growing seasons by use of early maturity 8 (eam8) mutations, also termed mat-a, are severely compromised in clock gene expression and clock outputs. We identified EAM8 as a barley ortholog of the Arabidopsis thaliana circadian clock regulator EARLY FLOWERING3 (ELF3) and demonstrate that eam8 accelerates the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth and inflorescence development. We propose that eam8 was selected as barley cultivation moved to high-latitude short-season environments in Europe because it allowed rapid flowering in genetic backgrounds that contained a previously selected late-flowering mutation of the photoperiod response gene Ppd-H1. We show that eam8 mutants have increased expression of the floral activator HvFT1, which is independent of allelic variation at Ppd-H1. The selection of independent eam8 mutations shows that this strategy facilitates short growth-season adaptation and expansion of the geographic range of barley, despite the pronounced clock defect.																	0027-8424					MAY 22	2012	109	21					8328	8333		10.1073/pnas.1120496109								WOS:000304445800081	22566625

Testicular and color variation in the kissing bug, Rhodnius brethesi, in Amazonas, Brazil	JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE												Because of the morphological and morphometric variation of testicular follicles in different genera of the subfamily Triatominae, it was of interest to associate those parameters with the different medial pronotal band patterns (wide and narrow) found in Rhodnius brethesi (Matta) (Hemiptera: Reduviidae). This is a wild species often associated with Leopoldina piassaba Wallace (Arecales: Arecaceae) palm, with a geographical distribution restricted to the Amazon region. The specimens used were from the state of Amazonas, and were kept under conditions of 29 +/- 1 degrees C, 80 +/- 5% RH, 12:12 L:D photoperiod, and were fed weekly on blood from Swiss mice. Three-day-old fasting males were separated in accordance with the patterns of the medial pronotal band, dissected, and the testicles removed. After removal of the testicular membrane, the follicles were spread, drawn by camera lucida, and measured. The results showed that the testis of R. brethesi consists of seven follicles, divided into two groups by length; two long and five short. In specimens with a wide medial pronotal band, the long follicles were 5.4 mm in length, but in specimens with a narrow medial band, the long follicles were 5.64 mm in length. The difference was significant. The short follicles were not different in length, suggesting the presence of a possible complex "brethesi" in the Amazon region.																	1536-2442	2250-2645				MAY 21	2012	12								65									WOS:000305004000001	22938518

Pulse Emissions of Carbon Dioxide during Snowmelt at a High-Elevation Site in Northern Arizona, U.S.A.	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												The paradigm that winter is a dormant period of soil biogeochemical activity in high elevation or high latitude ecosystems has been amply refuted by recent research. Carbon dioxide (CO2) released from cold or snow-covered soil is a substantial component of total annual ecosystem carbon fluxes. Recent investigations have shown that the late-winter/early-spring transition is a period of high biogeochemical activity. However, little is known about the temporal dynamics of CO2 from the snowpack itself during periods of snowmelt. We present a case study of three snowmelt events at a high-elevation site in northern Arizona during which we measured changes in CO2 concentrations and fluxes above the snow and within the soil profile, and characterized the soil physical environment and site meteorological variables. We show that large pulses of CO2 were emitted to the atmosphere during snowmelt, and we present evidence that these pulses came from CO2 stored in snowpack. Earlier and more frequent snowmelts worldwide caused by climate change have the potential to alter the timing of release of CO2 from land to atmosphere.																	1523-0430					MAY	2012	44	2					247	254		10.1657/1938-4246-44.2.247								WOS:000304723500010

The transition between these two states is accompanied by a range of behavioural and physiological responses to ensure their survival under adverse environmental conditions. Furthermore, aestivation plays an important role in shaping species distribution patterns. We examined the seasonal patterns in biochemical tissue composition in relation to aspects of behavioural ecology in three land snail populations: one mainland and one insular population of the widespread Helix aspersa and a population (sympatric with the latter) of Helix figulina, a congeneric species with a narrow and declining distribution. Helix figulina aestivates in underground borrows, while H. aspersa spends the summer under stones and may interrupt aestivation when conditions become favourable. Prior to aestivation H. figulina accumulates metabolic fuels, which it consumes later during summer, and at the same time loses substantial body water and increases lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity. The insular H. aspersa population follows a similar pattern (regarding metabolites and LDH activity), with the difference that water loss is limited. However, the mainland population of H. aspersa deviates from this model with energy metabolites and water levels showing little variation throughout the year, while LDH activity is reduced. These differences probably reflect the particular behavioural and physiological patterns adopted by each species. The specialist and range-restricted H. figulina shows a constant and more predictable seasonal pattern, which may be effective for surviving in its historical biogeographic range, but it seems to be more vulnerable to possibly changing environmental conditions. On the other hand the generalist and cosmopolitan H. aspersa adopts a more flexible pattern that compensates for the effects of adverse conditions during aestivation and permits a more effective exploitation of energy resources.

Identifying the genetic underpinning of adaptation to these complex selection environments and assigning causes of natural selection within multidimensional selection regimes in the wild is challenging. The water flea Daphnia is a renowned ecological model system with its well-documented ecology, the possibility to analyse subfossil dormant egg banks and the short generation time allowing an experimental evolution approach. Capitalizing on the strengths of this model system, we here link candidate genome regions to three selection pressures, known to induce micro-evolutionary responses in Daphnia magna: fish predation, parasitism and land use. Using a genome scan approach in space, time and experimental evolution trials, we provide solid evidence of selection at the genome level under well-characterized environmental gradients in the wild and identify candidate genes linked to the three environmental stressors. Our study reveals differential selection at the genome level in Daphnia populations and provides evidence for repeatable patterns of local adaptation in a geographic mosaic of environmental stressors fuelled by standing genetic variation. Our results imply high evolutionary potential of local populations, which is relevant to understand the dynamics of trait changes in natural populations and their impact on community and ecosystem responses through eco-evolutionary feedbacks.

Mountain Pine Beetle Develops an Unprecedented Summer Generation in Response to Climate Warming	AMERICAN NATURALIST												The mountain pine beetle (MPB; Dendroctonus ponderosae) is native to western North America, attacks most trees of the genus Pinus, and periodically erupts in epidemics. The current epidemic of the MPB is an order of magnitude larger than any previously recorded, reaching trees at higher elevation and latitude than ever before. Here we show that after 2 decades of air-temperature increases in the Colorado Front Range, the MPB flight season begins more than 1 month earlier than and is approximately twice as long as the historically reported season. We also report, for the first time, that the life cycle in some broods has increased from one to two generations per year. Because MPBs do not diapause and their development is controlled by temperature, they are responding to climate change through faster development. The expansion of the MPB into previously inhospitable environments, combined with the measured ability to increase reproductive output in such locations, indicates that the MPB is tracking climate change, exacerbating the current epidemic.

Genetic correlations and the evolution of photoperiodic time measurement within a local population of the pitcher-plant mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii	HEREDITY												The genetic relationship between the daily circadian clock and the seasonal photoperiodic timer remains a subject of intense controversy. In Wyeomyia smithii, the critical photoperiod (an overt expression of the photoperiodic timer) evolves independently of the rhythmic response to the Nanda-Hamner protocol (an overt expression of the daily circadian clock) over a wide geographical range in North America. Herein, we focus on these two processes within a single local population in which there is a negative genetic correlation between them. We show that antagonistic selection against this genetic correlation rapidly breaks it down and, in fact, reverses its sign, showing that the genetic correlation is due primarily to linkage and not to pleiotropy. This rapid reversal of the genetic correlation within a small, single population means that it is difficult to argue that circadian rhythmicity forms the necessary, causal basis for the adaptive divergence of photoperiodic time measurement within populations or for the evolution of photoperiodic time measurement among populations over a broad geographical gradient of seasonal selection.

Disturbance regimes and mountain plover habitat in shortgrass steppe: Large herbivore grazing does not substitute for prairie dog grazing or fire	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Restoring historical disturbance regimes to enhance habitat for grassland birds can conflict with livestock production goals and has been controversial because of uncertainty in the frequency and pattern of different disturbances prior to European settlement. We studied nesting habitat for the mountain plover (Charadrius montanus) in relation to prescribed fire, grazing by large herbivores (cattle), and grazing by black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) in the shortgrass steppe of northeastern Colorado. Breeding mountain plovers primarily occurred on black-tailed prairie dog colonies or areas burned during the previous dormant season. Vegetation surrounding mountain plover nests and foraging locations was characterized by a fine-scale mosaic of prostrate (<4?cm tall) vegetated patches interspersed with >35% bare soil in a given square meter, with this fine-scale pattern distributed over a broad (>100-m radius) area. Mountain plovers rarely occupied grassland lacking prairie dogs or recent fire, but those that did selected sites with similar vegetation height and bare soil exposure as sites on burns and prairie dog colonies. Vegetation structure at mountain plover-occupied sites was also similar to random sites on burns and prairie dog colonies, but differed substantially from sites managed only with cattle. Intensive cattle grazing at twice the recommended stocking rate during spring (MarMay) or summer (MayOct) for 6 years produced significantly less bare soil than burns and prairie dog colonies, particularly following years with average or above-average precipitation. Thus, intensive cattle grazing did not substitute for prairie dog grazing or fire in terms of effects on vegetation structure and mountain plover habitat. Both prescribed burning and increased size and distribution of black-tailed prairie dog colonies appear to be effective and complementary means to manage for mountain plover breeding habitat in shortgrass steppe. Provision of mountain plover habitat has tradeoffs with traditional management for livestock production. Thus, managers need to clearly define desired outcomes for management to provide multiple ecosystem goods and services.

Genetic and phenotypic variation in juvenile development in relation to temperature and developmental pathway in a geometrid moth	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY												Life histories show genetic population-level variation due to spatial variation in selection pressures. Phenotypic plasticity in life histories is also common, facilitating fine-tuning of the phenotype in relation to the prevailing selection regime. In multivoltine (= 2 generations per year) insects, individuals following alternative developmental pathways (diapause/direct development) experience different selection regimes. We studied the genetic and phenotypic components of juvenile development in Cabera exanthemata (Lepidoptera: Geometridae) in a factorial split-brood experiment. F2 offspring of individuals originating from populations in northern and central Finland were divided among manipulations defined by temperature (14 degrees C /20 degrees C ) and day length (24 h/15 h). Short day length invariably induced diapause, whereas continuous light almost invariably induced direct development in both regions, although northern populations are strictly univoltine in the wild. Individuals from northern Finland had higher growth rates, shorter development times and higher pupal masses than individuals from central Finland across the conditions, indicating genetic differences between regions. Individuals that developed directly into adults tended to have higher growth rates, shorter development times and higher pupal masses than those entering diapause, indicating phenotypic plasticity. Temperature-induced plasticity was substantial; growth rate was much higher, development time much shorter and pupal mass higher at 20 degrees C than at 14 degrees C . The degree of plasticity in relation to developmental pathway was pronounced at 20 degrees C in growth rate and development time and at 14 degrees C in pupal mass, emphasizing multidimensionality of reaction norms. The observed genetic variation and developmental plasticity seem adaptive in relation to time-stress due to seasonality.

The late winter has been suggested as a critical period for bird survival as a consequence of food shortage. We developed a model to understand how yearly and seasonal variations on the type and abundance of food items affect the winter energetic budget of the Azores bullfinch. The model is at steady-state as it simulates the winter-early spring period, when Azores bullfinches attain maximum weight, with non-significant fluctuations. The costs of basal metabolic rate (BMR), thermoregulation and other activities are included in the model. The potential energy available to Azores bullfinch between January and April in three different years was estimated based on day length, diet, pecking rates on different food items, their energetic content and assimilation efficiency. Simulations were run with probability distributions of the estimated available energy and the energy left for activities of the Azores bullfinch. Results indicate that between January and April, the bird's energetic requirement for BMR and thermoregulation range between 118 and 123 d(-1), peaking in March due to thermoregulation constraints. If the bird's energy with activities represent 36% of the energy spent with BMR plus thermoregulation, the estimated daily energy requirements of the Azores bullfinch fall within 160-167 kJd(-1). Results indicate that January and February are months when the bird may experience some kind of energy constraint due to low density of energy-rich items (<200 kJ feeding area(-1)). However, from March onwards and particularly in warmer years, the Azores bullfinch will have plenty energy for BMR, thermoregulation and activities, mostly due to the increasing consumption of Ilex perado flower buds. In relation to altitude variations, simulations indicate that thermoregulation costs increase 8 and 13% at mid- and high-altitude, respectively, compared to low-altitude. In terms of habitat management, we can infer that removing the exotic tree Clethra arborea should be undertaken with caution because, during winter C arborea seeds constitute an important food item to the bird. Alternatively if C. arborea is replaced by other energetically rich items, particularly at lower altitudes, the Azores bullfinch will potentially benefit from it. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Howard			Arctic plant diversity in the Early Eocene greenhouse	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												For the majority of the Early Caenozoic, a remarkable expanse of humid, mesothermal to temperate forests spread across Northern Polar regions that now contain specialized plant and animal communities adapted to life in extreme environments. Little is known on the taxonomic diversity of Arctic floras during greenhouse periods of the Caenozoic. We show for the first time that plant richness in the globally warm Early Eocene (approx. 55-52Myr) in the Canadian High Arctic (76 degrees N) is comparable with that approximately 3500 km further south at mid-latitudes in the US western interior (44-47 degrees N). Arctic Eocene pollen floras are most comparable in richness with today's forests in the southeastern United States, some 5000 km further south of the Arctic. Nearly half of the Eocene, Arctic plant taxa are endemic and the richness of pollen floras implies significant patchiness to the vegetation type and clear regional richness of angiosperms. The reduced latitudinal diversity gradient in Early Eocene North American plant species demonstrates that extreme photoperiod in the Arctic did not limit taxonomic diversity of plants.																	0962-8452					APR 22	2012	279	1733					1515	1521		10.1098/rspb.2011.1704								WOS:000301332900008	22072610

While the genetic network behind circadian rhythms is well described, relatively few reports exist of the phenological consequences of and selection on Clock genes in the wild. Here, we investigated variation in breeding phenology in relation to Clock genetic diversity in a long-distance migratory bird, the barn swallow (Hirundo rustica). Methodology/Principal Findings: In a sample of 922 adult barn swallows from a single population breeding in Italy we found one very common (Q(7)) and three rare (Q(5), Q(6), Q(8)) length variants of a functionally significant polyglutamine repeat. Rare (2.9%) Q(7)/Q(8) heterozygous females, but not males, bred significantly later than common (91.5%) Q(7)/Q(7) females, consistent with the expectation that 'long' alleles cause late breeding, as observed in a resident population of another bird species. Because breeding date depends on arrival date from migration, present results suggest that the association between breeding date and Clock might be mediated by migration phenology. In addition, fecundity selection appears to be operating against Q(7)/Q(8) because late migrating/breeding swallows have fewer clutches per season, and late breeding has additional negative selection effects via reduced offspring longevity. Genotype frequencies varied marginally non-significantly with age, as Q(7)/Q(8) frequency showed a 4-fold reduction in old individuals. This result suggests negative viability selection against Q(7)/Q(8), possibly mediated by costs of late breeding. Conclusions/Significance: This is the first study of migratory birds showing an association between breeding phenology and Clock genotype and suggesting that negative selection occurs on a phenologically deviant genotype. Low polymorphism at Clock may constrain microevolutionary phenological response to changing climate, and may thus contribute to the decline of barn swallow populations.

A total of 248 larvae were captured in the Kalong, and none were collected in the Tien Yen. There was little difference in development between the Kalong larvae and those of P. a. altivelis and P. a. ryukyuensis. Temperatures and salinities when the larvae were collected ranged from ca. 12 to 21A degrees C and from ca. 3.5 to 30 psu. The preflexion to flexion larvae (primarily preflexion with yolk, 5.2-12.9 mm BL) occurred in the central current from December to February, with a peak abundance in early January. The flexion to postflexion (primarily postflexion, 14.1-23.8 mm BL) larvae occurred in the bank waters from early January to late February. The larval occurrence in the Kalong was 1-2 months later than for P. a. altivelis in Japan and P. a. ryukyuensis in the Ryukyu Islands, probably because of the delay until a reasonable photoperiod for the start of spawning in the lower latitudinal region. The larvae were never collected from the sea, where the temperatures were lower than in the river and estuary in January and February, unlike in Japan.																	1341-8998	1616-3915				APR	2012	59	2					169	178		10.1007/s10228-011-0268-5								WOS:000303513400010

Thermal acclimation, heat shock and photoperiod: Do these factors interplay in the adaptive responses of crab neuromuscular systems to temperature?	JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY												Evidence is reviewed demonstrating that the adaptive responses to temperature made by the walking leg neuromuscular system of crabs (Carcinus maenas) are in response to local temperature and not in response to hierarchical influences by the CNS and hormonal systems. Evidence is presented showing that the laboratory acclimation responses in muscle membrane resting potential (RP) do not predict the responses in seasonal acclimatized crabs, suggesting that additional environmental factors may have a role. No consistent effect of either short or long day photoperiod was found on muscle membrane RP in 8 or 22 degrees C acclimated crabs. However, short day data for RP were more hyperpolarised than those from long day particularly at temperatures above 17 degrees C. In 8 degrees C acclimated crabs short day exposure resulted in consistently higher EJP amplitudes than following long day exposure. In 22 degrees C acclimated crabs day length had a less marked effect, but short day appeared to alter the pattern of response to temperature towards that for 8 degrees C acclimated crabs. Photoperiod was shown to have an effect on muscle tension, particularly in 8 degrees C acclimated crabs. Long day as compared to short day exposure resulted in a higher force generated at temperatures below about 17 degrees C with a marked temperature dependency. In 22 degrees C acclimated crabs the difference between short and long day exposure was less marked but in this case the force generated was consistently greater following short day exposure. Thus photoperiodic effects may play a role in acclimatization. Heat shock (HS) increased CTMax of 8 degrees C acclimated Carcinus from 33.04 +/- 0.2 to 34.17 +/- 0.52 degrees C. Following heat shock closer muscle RP was more hyperpolarised but the temperature dependency of RP was unaltered from non-heat shocked controls, furthermore HS increased the temperature at which RP failed from 25.21 +/- 0.71 to 34.17 +/- 0.52 degrees C. The effect of HS on EJP amplitude was complex, at low temperatures it lowered EJP amplitude but at higher temperatures the amplitude was increased. HS also significantly raised the temperature at which EJP failed from 23.39 +/- 0.73 to 27.43 +/- 1.16 degrees C. Force generated by the closer muscle was dependent on acclimation temperature. Short day photoperiod increased force generation particularly in cold acclimated crabs. HS reduced force generation over the temperature range measured. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Ecologists have focused on propagule pressure (for example, the number of individuals and invasion events), the characteristics of an invading species, and its new abiotic and biotic environment to predict the likelihood of range expansion and invasion. Here, we emphasize the role of photoperiodic response on the range expansion of species. Unlike temperature, the latitudinal gradient of seasonal changes in day length is a stable, abiotic environmental factor that does not change with local or global climate. Predicting range expansions across latitudes and the subsequent consequences for native communities requires a more comprehensive understanding of how species use day length to coordinate seasonal growth, reproduction, physiology and synchronization of life cycles with interacting individuals and species.

J	Larkin, DJ				Larkin, Daniel J.			Lengths and correlates of lag phases in upper-Midwest plant invasions	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												There are often lag phases in plant invasions, seemingly dormant periods between arrival in a new range and rapid population growth. Lags impede prioritization of invasive-species control efforts: when eradication is most feasible, it is often unclear whether a species is benign or a potentially harmful "sleeper weed." I used herbarium records to estimate lag phases for invasive or potentially invasive plant species in three regions of the upper Midwest. I tested whether factors related to species' invasion epidemiology, traits, or the habitats they invade were correlated with lag lengths. From an initial pool of 151 species, there were sufficient records to test for lags in 76 for northern Wisconsin, 90 for southern Wisconsin, and 91 for the southern Lake Michigan region. Lags were identified in 77% (197) of these 257 datasets and ranged from 3-140 years with a mean of 47.3 +/- A 34.6 (SD). Lags differed by native range, introduction pathway, growth form and habit, dispersal mode, flowering phenology, pollination mode for a subset of species, and breadth, light availability, and water availability of invaded habitats. However, estimated lags were highly variable and tested factors did not have strong explanatory power. Exotic species comprised an increasing proportion of total herbarium records. Of the species with known introduction pathways, 85% were intentionally introduced, mainly as ornamentals. The long durations, high variability, and low predictability of lags, along with human culpability for an increasingly non-native flora, support a cautious approach to species introductions.																	1387-3547					APR	2012	14	4					827	838		10.1007/s10530-011-0119-3								WOS:000302101800006

This issue also has important implications for anticipating biological responses to contemporary climate warming and determining the processes by which invasive species are able to spread rapidly across broad geographic ranges. Here, we compare data from a historical study of latitudinal variation in photoperiodic response among Japanese and U. S. populations of the invasive Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus with contemporary data obtained using comparable methods. Our results demonstrated rapid adaptive evolution of the photoperiodic response during invasion and range expansion across similar to 15 degrees of latitude in the United States. In contrast to the photoperiodic response, size-based morphological traits implicated in climatic adaptation in a wide range of other insects did not show evidence of adaptive variation in Ae. albopictus across either the U. S. (invasive) or Japanese (native) range. These results show that photoperiodism has been an important adaptation to climatic variation across the U. S. range of Ae. albopictus and, in conjunction with previous studies, strongly implicate the photoperiodic control of seasonal development as a critical evolutionary response to ongoing contemporary climate change. These results also emphasize that photoperiodism warrants increased attention in studies of the evolution of invasive species.																	0003-0147					APR	2012	179	4					490	500		10.1086/664709								WOS:000301975200008	22437178

Elevational trends in butterfly phenology: implications for species responses to climate change	ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												1. Impacts of global change on the distribution, abundance, and phenology of species have been widely documented. In particular, recent climate change has led to widespread changes in animal and plant seasonality, leading to debate about its potential to cause phenological mismatches among interacting taxa. 2. In mountainous regions, populations of many species show pronounced phenological gradients over short geographic distances, presenting the opportunity to test for effects of climate on phenology, independent of variation in confounding factors such as photoperiod. 3. Here we show for 32 butterfly species sampled for five years over a 1700 m gradient (560-2260 m) in a Mediterranean mountain range that, on average, annual flight period is delayed with elevation by 15-22 days per kilometre. Species mainly occurring at low elevations in the region, and to some extent those flying earlier in the year, showed phenological delays of 23-36 days per kilometre, whereas the flight periods of species that occupy high elevations, or fly in late summer, were consistently more synchronised over the elevation gradient. 4. Elevational patterns in phenology appear to reflect a narrowing phenological window of opportunity for larval and adult butterfly activity of high elevation and late-flying species. 5. Here, we speculate as to the causes of these patterns, and the consequences for our ability to predict species responses to climate change. Our results raise questions about the use of space-time substitutions in predicting phenological responses to climate change, since traits relating to flight period and environmental associations may influence the capacity of species to adapt to changing climates.

Seasonal wing colour plasticity varies dramatically between buckeye butterfly populations in different climatic zones	ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												1. In the present study, how seasonal wing colour plasticity in buckeye butterflies (Junonia coenia Hubner) differs between populations in different climatic regions, and whether these differences are explained by regional environmental differences or reflect genetic divergences in plasticity is addressed. 2. Using museum specimen data, it is shown that buckeye wing colour variation is much greater in populations from the humid and subtropical climates of the eastern U. S. A. than in populations from the desert and mediterranean climates of the western U. S. A. 3. Museum specimen data further show that wing colour in eastern populations is strongly correlated with seasonal variation in day length and temperature, whereas wing colour in western populations is only weakly associated with these cues. 4. Controlled incubator experiments comparing Southern California and North Carolina populations suggest that regional differences in wing pattern variation are attributable to dramatically increased robustness to environmental variation in western populations. 5. Together these experiments show that while phenotypic variation can be influenced by environmental cues, the range of this variation can genetically diverge between populations in different regions.

Latitudinal variation and distribution of photoperiod and temperature sensitivity for flowering in the world collection of pearl millet germplasm at ICRISAT genebank	PLANT GENETIC RESOURCES-CHARACTERIZATION AND UTILIZATION												The ICRISAT genebank, Patancheru, India holds 22,211 pearl millet germplasm accessions from 50 countries, including 19,063 landraces. Among these, 15,904 landraces that were geo-referenced are either thermo-sensitive (52.5%), or photoperiod-sensitive (45.6%), or insensitive to both temperature and photoperiod (2%). Latitude ranges of 10-15 degrees N with 39.6% and 15-20 degrees S with 13.1% of total accessions are the important regions for pearl millet germplasm. A study on climate data of the germplasm collection sites revealed that most accessions from latitudes ranging from 10 to 20 degrees on both sides of the equator were highly sensitive to longer photoperiod (>12.5 h) and/or lower temperature (<12 degrees C). Accessions that originated in locations at higher latitudes (>20-35 degrees) on both the hemispheres exhibited low sensitivity to both photoperiod and low temperature, as they were exposed to such climates during their evolution. The accessions that are insensitive to both photoperiod and temperature were few but they originated from locations spread across all latitudes, although the highest numbers were from mid-latitudes (15-20 degrees) in both hemispheres. As germplasm accessions are sensitive to climatic variables such as temperature and photoperiod, recording of location-specific geo-reference data while collecting the germplasm, which can help to elucidate the sensitivity of accessions to temperature and photoperiod, is emphasized. Critical evaluation of photoperiod-sensitive accessions that are late flowering for forage production and the photoperiod-insensitive early-maturing accessions for grain production, multiple cropping and development of parental lines with synchronized flowering for the development of hybrids is suggested.

Host selection and responses to forest fragmentation in acorn weevils: inferences from dynamic occupancy models	OIKOS												Prior studies on species-specific responses to habitat alteration have demonstrated that niche breadth is positively associated with patch occupancy rates in landscapes fragmented by agriculture. However, these studies generally have focused on vertebrates and relied upon data collected at a single point in time, neglecting dynamic processes that could alter inferences. We studied the effects of host selection and forest fragmentation on population dynamics of acorn weevils Curculio, the primary insect seed predators of oaks in North America. Detection/non-detection data were collected from 174 red and white oaks in 19 forested fragments from 20052008. We used dynamic multi-season site-occupancy models within a Bayesian framework to explore variation in patch (tree-level) occupancy dynamics of three species of weevils that vary in their specialization, i.e. their relative selection of red and white oak as hosts: C. pardalis (white oak specialist), C. sulcatulus (generalist) and C. proboscideus (generalist). Contrary to expectations, the specialist exhibited greater estimated rates of occupancy than generalists. However, red oak trees occupied by the white oak specialist appeared to function as sink populations maintained by frequent colonization following local extinction. Specialists also exhibited greater relative variation in occupancy and relative abundance on their host trees among years. Generalists exhibited lower local extinction and colonization rates than the specialist. Occupancy and vital rates of weevils on a host tree increased with acorn production and were significantly influenced by neighborhood forest density. Our results suggest that across much of their range in the eastern United States acorn weevils exist in fragmented, temporally dynamic landscapes, with generalists occurring on a lower proportion of usable trees but buffered by access to more suitable patches and greater patch-specific survival. More generally, our results demonstrate that estimates of specialization derived from occupancy data may be misleading in the absence of patch-specific information on vital rates.

Thermal Variability Increases the Impact of Autumnal Warming and Drives Metabolic Depression in an Overwintering Butterfly	PLOS ONE												Increases in thermal variability elevate metabolic rate due to Jensen's inequality, and increased metabolic rate decreases the fitness of dormant ectotherms by increasing consumption of stored energy reserves. Theory predicts that ectotherms should respond to increased thermal variability by lowering the thermal sensitivity of metabolism, which will reduce the impact of the warm portion of thermal variability. We examined the thermal sensitivity of metabolic rate of overwintering Erynnis propertius (Lepidoptera: Hesperiidae) larvae from a stable or variable environment reared in the laboratory in a reciprocal common garden design, and used these data to model energy use during the winters of 1973-2010 using meteorological data to predict the energetic outcomes of metabolic compensation and phenological shifts. Larvae that experienced variable temperatures had decreased thermal sensitivity of metabolic rate, and were larger than those reared at stable temperatures, which could partially compensate for the increased energetic demands. Even with depressed thermal sensitivity, the variable environment was more energy-demanding than the stable, with the majority of this demand occurring in autumn. Autumn phenology changes thus had disproportionate influence on energy consumption in variable environments, and variable-reared larvae were most susceptible to overwinter energy drain. Therefore the energetic impacts of the timing of entry into winter dormancy will strongly influence ectotherm fitness in northern temperate environments. We conclude that thermal variability drives the expression of metabolic suppression in this species; that phenological shifts will have a greater impact on ectotherms in variable thermal environments; and that E. propertius will be more sensitive to shifts in phenology in autumn than in spring. This suggests that increases in overwinter thermal variability and/or extended, warm autumns, will negatively impact all non-feeding dormant ectotherms which lack the ability to suppress their overwinter metabolic thermal sensitivity.

Copy Number Variation Affecting the Photoperiod-B1 and Vernalization-A1 Genes Is Associated with Altered Flowering Time in Wheat (Triticum aestivum)	PLOS ONE												The timing of flowering during the year is an important adaptive character affecting reproductive success in plants and is critical to crop yield. Flowering time has been extensively manipulated in crops such as wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) during domestication, and this enables them to grow productively in a wide range of environments. Several major genes controlling flowering time have been identified in wheat with mutant alleles having sequence changes such as insertions, deletions or point mutations. We investigated genetic variants in commercial varieties of wheat that regulate flowering by altering photoperiod response (Ppd-B1 alleles) or vernalization requirement (Vrn-A1 alleles) and for which no candidate mutation was found within the gene sequence. Genetic and genomic approaches showed that in both cases alleles conferring altered flowering time had an increased copy number of the gene and altered gene expression. Alleles with an increased copy number of Ppd-B1 confer an early flowering day neutral phenotype and have arisen independently at least twice. Plants with an increased copy number of Vrn-A1 have an increased requirement for vernalization so that longer periods of cold are required to potentiate flowering. The results suggest that copy number variation (CNV) plays a significant role in wheat adaptation.																	1932-6203					MAR 22	2012	7	3							e33234	10.1371/journal.pone.0033234								WOS:000303909200025	22457747

NOTES ON A RECENTLY DISCOVERED POPULATION OF HADENA ECTYPA (MORRISON, 1875) (NOCTUIDAE: NOCTUINAE: HADENINI) IN MASSACHUSETTS	JOURNAL OF THE LEPIDOPTERISTS SOCIETY												Hadena ectypa (Morrison, 1875) (Noctuidae: Noctuinae: Hadenini) is a rarely encountered moth of conservation concern, inhabiting forest and woodland openings and edges in eastern North America. A population discovered in 2002 in Massachusetts (USA) is the first record of this species in New England. Hadena ectypa larvae from this population were reared in 2003, 2009, and 2010; the immature stages and life history are described. Parasitism by a species of Eulophus Geoffroy, 1762 (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) and predation by Toxomerus geminatus (Say, 1823) (Diptera: Syrphidae) were observed. The native host plant of Hadena ectypa is Silene stellata (L.) W.T. Aiton (Caryophyllaceae), however, the population in Massachusetts uses introduced Silene vulgaris (Moench) Garcke as the primary larval host. Hadena ectypa could have adopted S. vulgaris as a novel host at any time during the past 200 years. S. vulgaris shares a number of traits with S. stellata that may have facilitated this host shift. Many of these traits are also shared by another introduced species, Silene latifolia Poiret, and while Hadena ectypa will feed on this plant in captivity, is not known to use it in the wild. The adoption of S. vulgaris as a larval host may allow Hadena ectypa to spread to new, weedier habitats, to increase its geographic range, and to increase its propensity for a second annual generation.																	0024-0966					MAR 19	2012	66	1					1	10										WOS:000301998800001

In 1961, the cultivar Mari (mat-a. 8) was the very first induced early barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) mutant to be released into commercial production. Mari extended the range of two-row spring barley cultivation as a result of its photoperiod insensitivity. Since its release, Mari or its derivatives have been used extensively across the world to facilitate short-season adaptation and further geographic range extension. By exploiting an extended historical collection of early-flowering mutants of barley, we identified Praematurum-a (Mat-a), the gene responsible for this key adaptive phenotype, as a homolog of the Arabidopsis thaliana circadian clock regulator Early Flowering 3 (Elf3). We characterized 87 induced mat-a mutant lines and identified >20 different mat-a alleles that had clear mutations leading to a defective putative ELF3 protein. Expression analysis of HvElf3 and Gigantea in mutant and wild-type plants demonstrated that mat-a mutations disturb the flowering pathway, leading to the early phenotype. Alleles of Mat-a therefore have important and demonstrated breeding value in barley but probably also in many other day-length-sensitive crop plants, where they may tune adaptation to different geographic regions and climatic conditions, a critical issue in times of global warming.

Movements and Habitat Use of Eastern Foxsnakes (Pantherophis gloydi) in Two Areas Varying in Size and Fragmentation	JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY												Determining how animals respond to habitat loss and fragmentation requires detailed studies of habitat use and behavior in regions that vary in their degree of fragmentation. As predators, snakes are an important component of ecosystems, yet little is known about how they respond behaviorally to habitat loss. Using radiotelemetry at two locations that differ in their habitat patch size, we examined habitat-use patterns at two spatial scales and movement patterns for the endangered Eastern Foxsnake (Phantherophis gloydi). Movement patterns were similar at the two locations, but individuals exhibited greater variation in home-range size, and males and gravid females dispersed further from hibernation sites within the larger natural habitat patch. Individuals from both locations preferred marsh at the home-range scale, but open dry habitat at the location scale. Within the smaller habitat patch, however, these preferences were accentuated with snakes avoiding agricultural fields. At the landscape scale, individual occurrence records were found closer to, and in areas with a higher density of, usable habitat than locations that are distributed randomly.

Modelling the potential impact of climate variability and change on species regeneration potential in the temperate forests of South-Eastern Australia	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												The sensitivity of early plant regeneration to environmental change makes regeneration a critical stage for understanding species response to climate change. We investigated the spatial and temporal response of eucalypt trees in the Central Highland region of south eastern Australia to high and low climate change scenarios. We developed a novel mechanistic model incorporating germination processes, TACA-GEM, to evaluate establishment probabilities of five key eucalypt species, Eucalyptus pauciflora, Eucalyptus delegatensis, Eucalyptus regnans, Eucalyptus nitens and Eucalyptus obliqua. Changes to regeneration potential at landscape and site levels were calculated to determine climate thresholds. Model results demonstrated that climate change is likely to impact plant regeneration. We observed increases and decreases in regeneration potential depending on the ecosystem, indicating that some species will increase in abundance in some forest types, whilst other forest types will become inhabitable. In general, the dry forest ecosystems were most impacted, whilst the wet forests were least impacted. We also observed that species with seed dormancy mechanisms, like E. pauciflora and E. delegatensis, are likely to be at higher risk than those without. Landscape- and site-level analysis revealed heterogeneity in species response at different scales. On a landscape scale, a 4.3 degrees C mean temperature increase and 22% decline in precipitation (predicted for 2080) is predicted to be a threshold for large spatial shifts in species regeneration niches across the study region, while a 2.6 degrees C increase and 15% decline in precipitation (predicted for 2050) will likely result in local site-level shifts. Site-level analysis showed that considerable declines in regeneration potential for E. delegatensis, E. pauciflora and E. nitens were modelled to occur in some ecosystems by 2050. While overall model performance and accuracy was good, better understanding of effects from extreme events and other underlying processes on regeneration will improve modelling and development of species conservation strategies.

Testing the Role of an Elusive Variable	PLOS ONE												Differences in day length may act as a critical factor in bird biology by introducing time constraints in energy acquisition during winter. Thus, differences in day length might operate as a main determinant of bird abundance along latitudinal gradients. This work examines the influence of day length on the abundance of wintering crested tits (Lophophanes cristatus) in 26 localities of Spanish juniper (Juniperus thurifera) dwarf woodlands (average height of 5 m) located along a latitudinal gradient in the Spanish highlands, while controlling for the influence of food availability, minimum night temperature, habitat structure and landscape characteristics. Top regression models in the AIC framework explained 56% of variance in bird numbers. All models incorporated day length as the variable with the highest magnitude effect. Food availability also played an important role, although only the crop of ripe juniper fruits, but not arthropods, positively affected crested tit abundance. Differences in vegetation structure across localities had also a strong positive effect (average tree height and juniper tree density). Geographical variation in night temperature had no influence on crested tit distribution, despite the low winter temperatures reached in these dwarf forests. This paper demonstrates for the first time that winter bird abundance increases with day length after controlling for the effect of other environmental variables. Winter average difference in day length was only 10.5 minutes per day along the 1 degrees 47' latitudinal interval (190 km) included in this study. This amount of time, which reaches 13.5 h accumulated throughout the winter season, appears to be large enough to affect the long-term energy budget of small passerines during winter and to shape the distribution of winter bird abundance under restrictive environmental conditions.

J	Colinet, H; Renault, D; Charoy-Guevel, B; Com, E				Colinet, Herve; Renault, David; Charoy-Guevel, Blandine; Com, Emmanuelle			Metabolic and Proteomic Profiling of Diapause in the Aphid Parasitoid Praon volucre	PLOS ONE												Background: Diapause, a condition of developmental arrest and metabolic depression exhibited by a wide range of animals is accompanied by complex physiological and biochemical changes that generally enhance environmental stress tolerance and synchronize reproduction. Even though some aspects of diapause have been well characterized, very little is known about the full range of molecular and biochemical modifications underlying diapause in non-model organisms. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study we focused on the parasitic wasp, Praon volucre that exhibits a pupal diapause in response to environmental signals. System-wide metabolic changes occurring during diapause were investigated using GC-MS metabolic fingerprinting. Moreover, proteomic changes were studied in diapausing versus nondiapausing phenotypes using a combination of two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and mass spectrometry. We found a reduction of Krebs cycle intermediates which most likely resulted from the metabolic depression. Glycolysis was galvanized, probably to favor polyols biosynthesis. Diapausing parasitoids accumulated high levels of cryoprotective polyols, especially sorbitol. A large set of proteins were modulated during diapause and these were involved in various functions such as remodeling of cytoskeleton and cuticle, stress tolerance, protein turnover, lipid metabolism and various metabolic enzymes. Conclusions/Significance: The results presented here provide some first clues about the molecular and biochemical events that characterize the diapause syndrome in aphid parasitoids. These data are useful for probing potential commonality of parasitoids diapause with other taxa and they will help creating a general understanding of diapause underpinnings and a background for future interpretations.

The objectives of our study were to develop a tool to predict mosquito abundance over time, identify the main determinants of mosquito population dynamics, and assess mosquito control strategies. We developed a generic, mechanistic, climate-driven model of seasonal mosquito population dynamics that can be run over several years because it takes diapause into account. Both aquatic and adult stages are considered, resulting in 10 model compartments: eggs, larvae, and pupae for juveniles; emergent, nulliparous, and parous for adults, the latter two broken down into host-seeking, resting, and ovipositing adults. We then applied the model to Anopheles species of southern France, some of which (nulliparous adults) overwinter. We defined specific transition functions and parameter values for these species and this geographical area based on a literature review. Our model correctly predicted entomological field data. Control points in the model were related to mortality rates of adults, the sex-ratio at emergence, parameters related to development functions and the number of eggs laid by females. Lastly, we used our model to compare the efficiency of mosquito control strategies targeting larvae. We found that a larvicide spraying at regular time intervals acted as a preventive measure against mosquito emergence, and that such a strategy was more efficient than spraying only when the abundance of host-seeking females reached a given threshold. The proposed model can be applied easily to other mosquito species and geographic areas by adapting transition functions and parameter values. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Pearce, E; Dunbar, R				Pearce, Eiluned; Dunbar, Robin			Latitudinal variation in light levels drives human visual system size	BIOLOGY LETTERS												Ambient light levels influence visual system size in birds and primates. Here, we argue that the same is true for humans. Light levels, in terms of both the amount of light hitting the Earth's surface and day length, decrease with increasing latitude. We demonstrate a significant positive relationship between absolute latitude and human orbital volume, an index of eyeball size. Owing to tight scaling between visual system components, this will translate into enlarged visual cortices at higher latitudes. We also show that visual acuity measured under full-daylight conditions is constant across latitudes, indicating that selection for larger visual systems has mitigated the effect of reduced ambient light levels. This provides, to our knowledge, the first support that light levels drive intraspecific variation in visual system size in the human population.

These environments are currently vanishing because of increasing human pressure. Chirocephalus kerkyrensis is a fairy shrimp typical of temporary water bodies in Mediterranean plain forests and has undergone a substantial decline in number of populations in recent years due to habitat loss. We assessed patterns of genetic connectivity and phylogeographic history in the seven extant populations of the species from Albania, Corfu Is. (Greece), Southern and Central Italy. Methodology/Principal Findings: We analyzed sequence variation at two mitochondrial DNA genes (Cytochrome Oxidase I and 16s rRNA) in all the known populations of C. kerkyrensis. We used multiple phylogenetic, phylogeographic and coalescence-based approaches to assess connectivity and historical demography across the whole distribution range of the species. C. kerkyrensis is genetically subdivided into three main mitochondrial lineages; two of them are geographically localized (Corfu Is. and Central Italy) and one encompasses a wide geographic area (Albania and Southern Italy). Most of the detected genetic variation (approximate to 81%) is apportioned among the aforementioned lineages. Conclusions/Significance: Multiple analyses of mismatch distributions consistently supported both past demographic and spatial expansions with the former predating the latter; demographic expansions were consistently placed during interglacial warm phases of the Pleistocene while spatial expansions were restricted to cold periods. Coalescence methods revealed a scenario of past isolation with low levels of gene flow in line with what is already known for other co-distributed fairy shrimps and suggest drift as the prevailing force in promoting local divergence. We recommend that these evolutionary trajectories should be taken in proper consideration in any effort aimed at protecting Mediterranean temporary water bodies.

We tracked thermal adaptations of the Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata) that invaded Europe within the last 100 years. It has occupied various conditions although, like the majority of invasive species, it lost a measurable amount of neutral genetic variation due to bottleneck effect when it invaded Europe. We exposed diapausing beetles originated from three different latitudes (54 degrees N, 59 degrees N, 60 degrees N) to cold shock (-5 degrees C, 1.5 hrs) in order to test if beetles from the northern populations express differential levels of cold-induced and constitutive Hsp70 compared to the beetles from milder temperature regime. The level of cold-induced Hsp70 was lowest in the northernmost beetle populations while the level of constitutive Hsp70 did not differ with the population. Moreover, the southernmost beetles were more plastic in their response to cold shock than the northernmost beetles. These results suggest that physiological adaptation, like the synthesis of Hsp70, can evolve very quickly.

Cold Hardiness of Helicoverpa zea (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) Pupae	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												An insect's cold hardiness affects its potential to overwinter and outbreak in different geographic regions. In this study, we characterized the response of Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) pupae to low temperatures by using controlled laboratory measurements of supercooling point (SCP), lower lethal temperature (LT50), and lower lethal time (LLTime). The impact of diapause, acclimation, and sex on the cold hardiness of the pupae also were evaluated. Sex did not significantly affect the SCP, LT50, or LLTime. However, the mean SCP of diapausing pupae ( -19.3 degrees C) was significantly lower than nondiapausing pupae (-16.4 degrees C). Acclimation of nondiapausing pupae to constant temperatures from 10 to 20 degrees C before supercooling also produced a significantly lower SCP than nondiapausing pupae held at 25 C. The LT(50)s of nondiapausing and diapausing were not significantly different, but confirmed that H. zea pupae are chill-intolerant because these lethal temperatures are warmer than the corresponding mean SCPs. Diapausing pupae survived longer than nondiapausing pupae at the same, constant, cold temperatures, a finding consistent with the SCP results. Both of these results suggest enhanced cold hardiness in diapausing pupae. When laboratory results were compared with field temperatures and observed distributions of H. zea in the contiguous United States, the laboratory results corroborated what is currently perceived to be the northern overwintering limit of H. zea; approximately the 40th parallel. Moreover, our research showed that areas north of this limit are lethal to overwintering pupae not because of low temperature extremes, but rather the length of time spent at near-zero temperatures.																	0046-225X					FEB	2012	41	1					172	179		10.1603/EN11026								WOS:000299804400020	22525073

All life stages of this recently described species were studied under a range of constant temperature conditions (17, 21, 25, 29, 33, 35 and 37 degrees C), a photoperiod of 12 h: 12 h (L: D) and 70 +/- 10% relative humidity. Adults of C. genanigra were fed on a diet consisting of a 1: 1 (v/v) mixture of brewer's yeast and honey, while larvae were provided with eggs of Sitotroga cerealella (Olivier) ad libitum. The duration of preimaginal development of the species was inversely proportional to temperature and ranged from approximately 63 days at 17 degrees C to 15 days at 35 degrees C. The percentage of adult emergence varied from 6.7% at 17 degrees C to 76.7% at 25 degrees C, although no larvae were able to complete development at 37 degrees C. The lower thermal threshold for total preimaginal development was approximately 10.8 degrees C and the thermal requirement was 336.7 degree-days. Egg production, along with the longevity of both males and females, were significantly affected by temperature. It is concluded that the best temperature for rearing C. genanigra is 25 degrees C, with the lowest preimaginal mortality and the highest egg production (992.7 eggs/female). (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

J	Poykko, H; Hyvarinen, M				Poykko, Heikki; Hyvarinen, Marko			To grow fast or to grow big? Time-limited larvae of Eilema depressum speed up their growth and reduce number of instars	ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA												According to life-history theory, longer development time may result in bigger adults. However, reaction norms describing age and size at maturity often follow an L-shaped form. This relationship is attributable to the simple notion that slowly growing individuals may not lengthen their development excessively after the maturation decision has been made, for example, when development is time limited in seasonal environments. In arthropods, growth occurs within instars, and thus the optimal growth strategy might be mediated by the phenotypic adjustment of instar numbers. We studied the relationship between age and size at maturity of a lichen-feeding moth, Eilema depressum (Esper) (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae: Lithosiinae), and the variability of instar numbers in relation to achieved adult body mass and time used for maturation. A positive relationship between age and size at maturity was found across developmental pathways and a negative one within the developmental pathways. Directly developing larvae had higher growth rates, attained smaller pupal mass, and passed fewer instars than larvae maturing after overwintering. Host quality did not affect whether larvae matured during the remaining or the next season. High variation in the number of instars together with variable growth rates indicates high plasticity in adaptation to varying environmental conditions. Our results also confirm previous results that instar number variability may be a key characteristic mediating age and size at maturity in insects.

Location North America. Methods A piecewise logistic model is used to extract phenological metrics from a time-series data set of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). An extensive comparison between satellite-derived phenological metrics and ground-based phenology observations for 14,179 records of 73 plant species at 802 sites across North America is made to evaluate the information about phenology shifts obtained in this study. Results The spatial pattern of vegetation phenology shows a strong dependence on latitude but a substantial variation along the longitudinal gradient. A delayed dormancy onset date (0.551 days year(-1), P = 0.013) and an extended growing season length (0.683 days year(-1), P = 0.011) are found over the mid and high latitudes in North America during 1982-2006, while no significant trends in greenup onset are observed. The delayed dormancy onset date and extended growing season length are mainly found in the shrubland biome. An extensive validation indicates a strong robustness of the satellite-derived phenology information. Main conclusions It is the delayed dormancy onset date, rather than an advanced greenup onset date, that has contributed to the prolonged length of the growing season over the mid and high latitudes in North America during recent decades. Shrublands contribute the most to the delayed dormancy onset date and the extended growing season length. This shift of vegetation phenology implies that vegetation activity in North America has been altered by climatic change, which may further affect ecosystem structure and function in the continent.

We utilized these 'larva chips' to characterize several subcellular responses to axotomy which occur over a range of time scales in intact, unanaesthetized animals. These include waves of calcium which are induced within seconds of axotomy, and the intracellular transport of vesicles whose rate and flux within axons changes dramatically within 3 hours of axotomy. Axonal transport halts throughout the entire distal stump, but increases in the proximal stump. These responses precede the degeneration of the distal stump and regenerative sprouting of the proximal stump, which is initiated after a 7 hour period of dormancy and is associated with a dramatic increase in F-actin dynamics. In addition to allowing for the study of axonal regeneration in vivo, the larva chips can be utilized for a wide variety of in vivo imaging applications in Drosophila.

Cdc7/Hsk1 is a conserved kinase required for initiation of DNA replication and may affect the site selection and timing of origin firing. We identified rif1 Delta, a null mutant of rif1(+), a conserved telomere-binding factor, as an efficient bypass mutant of fission yeast hsk1. Extensive deregulation of dormant origins over a wide range of the chromosomes occurs in rif1 Delta in the presence or absence of hydroxyurea (HU). At the same time, many early-firing, efficient origins are suppressed or delayed in firing timing in rif1 Delta. Rif1 binds not only to telomeres, but also to many specific locations on the arm segments that only partially overlap with the prereplicative complex assembly sites, although Rif1 tends to bind in the vicinity of the late/dormant origins activated in rif1 Delta. The binding to the arm segments occurs through M to G1 phase in a manner independent of Taz1 and appears to be essential for the replication timing program during the normal cell cycle. Our data demonstrate that Rif1 is a critical determinant of the origin activation program on the fission yeast chromosomes.																	0890-9369	1549-5477				JAN 15	2012	26	2					137	150		10.1101/gad.178491.111								WOS:000300157100006	22279046

THE ROLE OF FIRE-RETURN INTERVAL AND SEASON OF BURN IN SNAG DYNAMICS IN A SOUTH FLORIDA SLASH PINE FOREST	FIRE ECOLOGY												Standing dead trees, or snags, are an important habitat element for many animal species. In many ecosystems, fire is a primary driver of snag population dynamics because it can both create and consume snags. The objective of this study was to examine how variation in two key components of the fire regime-fire-return interval and season of burn-affected population dynamics of snags. Using a factorial design, we exposed 1 ha plots, located within larger burn units in a south Florida slash pine (Pinus elliottii var. densa Little and Dorman) forest, to prescribed fire applied at two intervals (approximately 3-year intervals vs. approximately 6-year intervals) and during two seasons (wet season vs. dry season) over a 12- to 13-year period. We found no consistent effect of fire season or frequency on the density of lightly to moderately decayed or heavily decayed snags, suggesting that variation in these elements of the fire regime at the scale we considered is relatively unimportant in the dynamics of snag populations. However, our confidence in these findings is limited by small sample sizes, potentially confounding effects of unmeasured variation in fire behavior and effects (e. g., intensity, severity, synergy with drought cycles) and wide variation in responses within a treatment level. The generalizing of our findings is also limited by the narrow range of treatment levels considered. Future experiments incorporating a wider range of fire regimes and directly quantifying fire intensity would prove useful in identifying more clearly the role of fire in shaping the dynamics of snag populations.

Maternal care in the Tasmanian echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus setosus)	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Parental care is central to the differences in reproductive behaviour and energy expenditure between males and females, and it is therefore crucial for understanding animal mating systems. Weinvestigated post-gestation maternal care in a wild population of short-beaked echidnas (Tachyglossus aculeatus) in the Tasmanian midlands using a combination of external temperature loggers and motion-triggered infrared cameras. For the first few weeks of early lactation mothers do not leave their nursery burrow, which they keep at a stable and warm temperature, resulting in a greater rate of maternal mass loss during the period of maternal burrow confinement than during hibernation. However, after lactating mothers recommence feeding, they raise a young to similar to 1.5 kg on a diet of their milk while increasing their own body mass by a similar amount. Weaning in our population appears not to be abrupt as there is a period where young echidnas begin exploratory foraging while their mother is still lactating. After young are weaned and abandon the nursery burrow, there appear to be no further associations between mothers and young despite young echidnas remaining within their mother's home range for the first 12 months of their life. Female echidnas time reproductive events with increases in ecosystem productivity, so that young are weaned at a time of maximum food abundance.																	0004-959X						2012	60	5					289	298		10.1071/ZO12066								WOS:000317419100001

Seasonal residency, habitat use, and site fidelity of juvenile sand tiger sharks Carcharias taurus in a Massachusetts estuary	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The sand tiger shark Carcharias taurus is a large coastal species that has endured marked declines in its western North Atlantic population over the past 30 yr. In the face of these declines, identification of nursery areas for this species is of particular importance to ensure the implementation of protective measures that will maximize survival of young individuals to maturity. Passive acoustic telemetry was used to assess the emergence of Plymouth, Kingston, Duxbury (PKD) Bay, Massachusetts, USA, as a seasonal nursery for juvenile sand tigers that migrate north from southern parturition grounds. Seasonal residency, habitat use, and site fidelity of 73 acoustically tagged juvenile sand tigers (78 to 108 cm fork length) were monitored within PKD Bay during 4 seasonal periods from 2008 to 2011. Eight individuals were tracked in multiple years, with 2 individuals returning to PKD Bay in 3 consecutive years. Sand tigers remained in PKD Bay for periods of 1 to 124 d and displayed a high degree of site fidelity to 2 core habitats during each year of the study. Weekly activity space estimates were relatively constant throughout each yearly monitoring period, with a general increase prior to emigration of sharks from the embayment. Emigration of sharks from PKD Bay was significantly related to both day length and water temperature. Collectively, these results suggest that PKD Bay constitutes a seasonal nursery area for juvenile sand tigers and warrants the extension of juvenile sand tiger essential fish habitat north of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, USA.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2012	471						165	U186		10.3354/meps09989								WOS:000312782700014

Clock gene variation in Tachycineta swallows	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Many animals use photoperiod cues to synchronize reproduction with environmental conditions and thereby improve their reproductive success. The circadian clock, which creates endogenous behavioral and physiological rhythms typically entrained to photoperiod, is well characterized at the molecular level. Recent work provided evidence for an association between Clock poly-Q length polymorphism and latitude and, within a population, an association with the date of laying and the length of the incubation period. Despite relatively high overall breeding synchrony, the timing of clutch initiation has a large impact on the fitness of swallows in the genus Tachycineta. We compared length polymorphism in the Clock poly-Q region among five populations from five different Tachycineta species that breed across a hemisphere-wide latitudinal gradient (Fig. 1). Clock poly-Q variation was not associated with latitude; however, there was an association between Clock poly-Q allele diversity and the degree of clutch size decline within breeding seasons. We did not find evidence for an association between Clock poly-Q variation and date of clutch initiation in for any of the five Tachycineta species, nor did we found a relationship between incubation duration and Clock genotype. Thus, there is no general association between latitude, breeding phenology, and Clock polymorphism in this clade of closely related birds.

In 2012 it was found in the next six new locations: two in Ljubljana (Rimska road and Koseze), in the village Veliko Trebeljevo approx. 25 km air distance from Ljubljana, near the village Smihel by Pivka, approx. 50 km from Ljubljana, Podturn near Dolenjske Toplice approx. 54 km from Ljubljana and arboretum Volcji Potok near Radomlje approx. 20 km from Ljubljana (locations: X=100496, Y=461632; X=103238, Y=459190; X=96365, Y=480155; X=56886, Y=436145; X=117053, Y=469814; X=66391, Y=503581). The adults were found on the daylilly plants from the end of May till October, when our observation ceased. This is the first report of O. kwansonis in Slovenia and in Europe as a pest of Hemerocalis spp. Its larvae bore longitudinal, whitish, meandering tunnels in the leaves of Hemerocallis plants (ophionoms), weakening them and reducing their ornamental value. Natural distribution of the species is Japan and Taiwan and in 2006 it was noticed in the United States of America where it is still spreading. The fly was not identified until 2011 and thus no legislative measures to prevent its spread were put in place. According to the observations from the USA O. kwansonis is a pest that causes economic damage in different species and ornamental varieties of Hemerocallis. Our preliminary and unsystematic observations show, that in Slovenia, due to the air distance spread of more than 70 km, the suppression of O. kwansonis is not possible any more. The introduction and the spread of this new pest again confirms the inefficiency of the phytosanitary system of the USA and of the European Union. To the authors knowledge no official measures against the pest were put into force in the EPPO region nor in the European phytosanitary system by the middle of October 2012, although the EPPO and SCPH were informed about the confirmation of the determination by the dipterologist dr. Michael von Tschirnhaus on 6th July 2012. Daylily trade is the probable pathway of the pest since hibernation occurs mostly underground in the lower parts of withered leaves, which are attached to dormant stolons in trade. Pest status of Ophiomyia kwansonis officially declared by the NPPO of Slovenia is: Transient: non-actionable.																	0373-1332						2012	136	9-10					501	507										WOS:000312058000008

Here we report the findings of our study aimed at examining robustness of circadian clocks in fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster populations selected to emerge as adults within a narrow window of time. Previously, we have reported that such flies display enhanced synchrony, accuracy, and precision in their adult emergence and activity/rest rhythms. Since it is expected that accurate and precise circadian clocks may confer enhanced stability in circadian time-keeping, we decided to examine robustness in circadian rhythms of flies from the selected populations by subjecting them to a variety of environmental conditions comprising of a range of photoperiods, light intensities, ambient temperatures, and constant darkness. The results revealed that adult emergence and activity/rest rhythms of flies from the selected stocks were more robust than controls, as they displayed enhanced stability under a wide variety of environmental conditions. These results suggest that selection for adult emergence within a narrow window of time results in the evolution of robustness in circadian timing systems of the fruit fly D. melanogaster.

J	Chmielewski, FM; Blumel, K; Palesova, I				Chmielewski, Frank-M.; Bluemel, Klaus; Palesova, Ivana			Climate change and shifts in dormancy release for deciduous fruit crops in Germany	CLIMATE RESEARCH												Four different chilling models, the Weinberger-Eggert model (C1), Utah model (C2), Positive Utah model (C3), and Dynamic model (C4), were used to evaluate possible future changes in the date of dormancy release (t(1)) in Germany for deciduous fruit crops with a chilling requirement (C*) ranging from 700 to 1800 chill units. The study was based on gridded air temperature data in a 7 x 11 km horizontal resolution for current and future climate conditions. Currently, dormancy of low chill crops, up to similar to 1000 chill units, is released evenly across Germany. However, for high chill cultivars (1500 to 1800 chill units) the chilling fulfillment occurs later in the colder continental, SE areas than in the mild, maritime NW regions of Germany. For future climate conditions (2071 to 2100), the patterns of t(1) will change, depending on the regional temperature rise. As a result, the areas which currently have a late date of dormancy release could have an advanced date in the future and vice versa, reducing the current differences between the northern and southern areas. Among the models, we found some different results. Model C1 showed a delay of t(1) for all values of C*. The other chilling models (C2-C4), showed a delay in t(1) for low chill varieties (700 to 1000 chill units), only small changes for medium chill varieties (1100 to 1400 chill units), and an earlier timing in the end of winter dormancy for fruit crops with a high C* (1500 to 1800 chill units). If we follow the results of these 3 models, we conclude that dormancy in a wide range of deciduous fruit crops in Germany will be released early enough to ensure a timely start of reproductive development in the future.																	0936-577X						2012	54	3					209	219		10.3354/cr01115								WOS:000310154500002

We collected carcasses of North American River Otters that had been legally harvested in southern Missouri, USA, between 1997 and 1999 as part of a larger population dynamics study. Embryos (n = 28) were removed from a subset of North American River Otters (n = 9) during necropsy. Using harvest dates and crown rump length measurements of embryos, we estimated implantation dates, which ranged from 7 December to 12 January, and parturition dates, which ranged from 8 February to 15 March (assuming an implantation time of 63 days). Our results are similar to other studies that have reported parturition dates ranging from mid-January to early May in more extreme latitudes. Our results suggest that variation in implantation and parturition dates among populations are likely related to factors affected by latitude such as photoperiod and winter weather severity.

Blacks (African Americans) Have Shorter Free-Running Circadian Periods Than Whites (Caucasian Americans)	CHRONOBIOLOGY INTERNATIONAL												The length of the free-running period (tau) affects how an animal re-entrains after phase shifts of the light-dark (LD) cycle. Those with shorter periods adapt faster to phase advances than those with longer periods, whereas those with longer periods adapt faster to phase delays than those with shorter periods. The free-running period of humans, measured in temporal isolation units and in forced desychrony protocols in which the day length is set beyond the range of entrainment, varies from about 23.5 to 26 h, depending on the individual and the experimental conditions (e.g., temporal isolation vs. forced desychrony). We studied 94 subjects free-running through an ultradian LD cycle, which was a forced desychrony with a day length of 4 h (2.5 h awake in dim light, similar to 35 lux, alternating with 1.5 h for sleep in darkness). Circadian phase assessments were conducted before (baseline) and after (final) three 24-h days of the ultradian LD cycle. During these assessments, saliva samples were collected every 30 min and subsequently analyzed for melatonin. The phase shift of the dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) from baseline to final phase assessment gave the free-running period. The mean +/- SD period was 24.31 +/- .23 h and ranged from 23.7 to 24.9 h. Black subjects had a significantly shorter free-running period than Whites (24.18 +/- .23 h, N = 20 vs. 24.37 +/- .22 h, N = 55). We had a greater proportion of women than men in our Black sample, so to check the t difference we compared the Black women to White women. Again, Black subjects had a significantly shorter free-running period (24.18 +/- .23, N = 17 vs. 24.41 +/- .23, N = 23). We did not find any sex differences in the free-running period. These findings give rise to several testable predictions: on average, Blacks should adapt quicker to eastward flights across time zones than Whites, whereas Whites should adjust quicker to westward flights than Blacks. Also, Blacks should have more difficulty adjusting to night-shift work and day sleep, which requires a phase delay. On the other hand, Whites should be more likely to have trouble adapting to the early work and school schedules imposed by society. More research is needed to confirm these results and predictions.

Data set since 1981 of Preila EMEP station enabled to establish that hot Summers, cold dormant, and dry and cold first-half of vegetation periods resulted in beech tree growth reduction. These meteorological parameters explained 57% variation in beech tree ring widths. Acidifying species had no significant effect on beech tree growth. Only ozone was among key factors contributing to beech stand productivity. Phytotoxic effect of this pollutant increased explanation rate of beech tree ring variation by 18%, that is, up to 75%. However, due to climate changes the warmer dormant periods alone are not the basis ensuring favourable conditions for beech tree growth. Increase in air temperature in June-August and decrease in precipitation amount in the first half of vegetation period should result in beech tree radial increment reduction. Despite the fact that phytotoxic effect of surface ozone should not increase due to stabilization in its concentration, it is rather problematic to expect better environmental conditions for beech tree growth at northern latitude of their pervasion.																	1537-744X						2012									743926	10.1100/2012/743926								WOS:000306559400001

Lepidopteran species differ in susceptibility to winter warming	CLIMATE RESEARCH												Predicting assemblage-level impacts of climate change requires knowledge of among-species variation in susceptibility to warming. Increased winter temperatures intuitively reduce cold stress for overwintering ectotherms, but can decrease fitness by increasing consumption of energy reserves. We kept overwintering stages of the butterflies Papilio glaucus, P. troilus (Papilionidae), and Erynnis propertius (Hesperiidae) under current temperatures and conditions simulating a 4 degrees C increase in mean temperature, and compared mass, water, energy reserves (lipid, protein and carbohydrate content), and, in E. propertius and P. troilus, post-winter development time, adult size, and mortality. All 3 species lost mass over winter, more so during warm winters. Erynnis propertius lost more mass than either Papilio. Warm winters increased energy reserve depletion in E. propertius, but had no effect on energy reserves of either Papilio. Warming reduced development time, but did not affect mortality or adult size of P. troilus. Mortality in E. propertius was uniformly high preventing assessment of treatment effects on survival, development, or adult size. The observed overwinter mass loss by E. propertius and P. troilus was predominantly due to water loss; thus we conclude that mass loss is not an appropriate measurement of energy drain in insects, rather body composition should be measured directly. Thus, P. glaucus and P. troilus have low vulnerability to winter warming, while E. propertius shows some vulnerability. Measuring the impact of winter warming on many species will enable the identification of species traits that predict vulnerability, and facilitate identification of clades particularly susceptible to winter warming.

This study was carried out to evaluate the efficacies of two predatory mite species, Neoseiulus californicus (McGregor), an introduced species in Iran, and Typhlodromus bagdasarjani Wainstein & Arutunjan, a native species, as biocontrol agents of Te. urticae. The functional response and mutual interference of these two phytoseiid mites were determined under laboratory conditions at 25 degrees C, 65% RH and a photoperiod of 16 h light: 8 h dark. The functional response of the two predator species to eggs or nymphs of Te. urticae was type II. The highest attack rate (0.0936 h(-1)) and the lowest handling time (1.6451 h) were recorded for N. californicus on eggs and the lowest attack rate (0.0473 h(-1)) and the highest handling time (2.399 h) were estimated for T. bagdasarjani on nymphs of Te. urticae. Nicholson's model and linear regression were used to determine the per capita searching efficiency and interference coefficient, respectively. The per capita searching efficiencies of the two predators decreased significantly with increasing predator densities. The interference coefficient for N. californicus was less than that for T. bagdasarjani. In addition, N. californicus had the highest predation potential, particularly on eggs of Te. urticae. Therefore, based on the attack rate and the handling time, N. californicus may be a more efficient biocontrol agent of Te. urticae on cucumber leaves in comparison to T. bagdasarjani.

Fifty 1-day-old eggs of P. plumifer were kept individually in a growth chamber at each temperature and all events were recorded daily for all immature and adult stages. Adult female longevity decreased from 73.42 days at 15 degrees C to 34.73 days at 35 degrees C. The net reproductive rate (R-0) increased with increasing temperature from 15 degrees C (8.70 females/female) to 27 degrees C (29.6 females/female) and then decreased noticeably. The values of the intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)) and finite rate of increase (lambda) were recorded to be highest at 30 degrees C (0.257 day(-1) and 1.29 day(-1), respectively), which decreased at 35 degrees C (0.244 day(-1) and 1.28 day(-1), respectively). The mean generation time (T) decreased significantly with increasing temperature from 15 degrees C (48.75 days) to 35 degrees C (11.02 days). The shortest doubling time (DT) was observed at 30 degrees C (2.69 days). The highest and lowest values of total fecundity were obtained at 25 degrees C (49.10 eggs/female) and 35 degrees C (19.71 eggs/female), respectively. Our findings revealed that the examined population of P. plumifer can develop and reproduce under a wide range of temperatures (15-35 degrees C), but its potential for control of two-spotted spider mite in the field has yet to be determined.

The two coupled oscillators track dawn and dusk and flexibly adapt their phase relationship to seasonal changes. This is also true for the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster that serves as model organism to understand the molecular and anatomical bases of the dual-oscillator system. In the present study, the authors investigated which temperature parameters are crucial for timing morning and evening activity peaks by applying natural-like temperature cycles with different daylengths. The authors found that the morning peak synchronizes to the temperature increase in the morning and the evening peak to the temperature decrease in the afternoon. The two peaks did not occur at fixed absolute temperatures, but responded flexibly to daylength and overall temperature level. Especially, the phase of the evening peak clearly depended on the absolute temperature level: it was delayed at high temperatures, whereas the phase of the M peak was less influenced. This suggests that the two oscillators have different temperature sensitivities. The bimodal activity rhythm was absent in the circadian clock mutants Clk(Jrk) and cyc(01) and reduced in per(01) and tim(01) mutants. Whereas the activity of Clk(Jrk) mutants just followed the temperature cycles, that of per(01) and tim(01) mutants did not, suggesting that these mutants are not completely clockless. This study revealed new characteristics of the dual-oscillator system in Drosophila that were not detected under different photoperiods.

Impact of Perinatal Photoperiod on the Chronotype of 11-to 18-Year-Olds in Northern European Russia	CHRONOBIOLOGY INTERNATIONAL												The study investigates the effect of the month of birth and ambient light conditions at birth on sleep length and chronotype among residents of high latitudes. The authors surveyed 1172 persons (609 girls, 563 boys) age 11 to 18 yrs living in five villages and four towns located between 59.5 degrees N and 67.6 degrees N latitude. Survey participation was voluntary and anonymous. Sleep length and chronotype were assessed using the Munich chronotype questionnaire (MCTQ). The study showed the sleep length and chronotype of the children and adolescents depended on sex, age, type of settlement (town/village), and latitude of residence. Latitude exerted a stronger impact on sleep length and chronotype of children and adolescents living in villages than on those of their urban counterparts. Month of birth had no effect on sleep length and chronotype. There was a significant effect of the time of sunrise, sunset, and day length at birth on the chronotype of children and adolescents. A later chronotype was observed in the sample of young persons living above the Arctic Circle who were born during the polar day and polar night.

Whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) assisted migration potential: testing establishment north of the species range	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												The "translocation of species into habitable locations outside of their current ranges, termed assisted migration, has been proposed as a means of saving vulnerable species from extinction as a result of climate change. We explore the use of this controversial technique using a threatened keystone species in western North America, whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis), as a case study. Species distribution models predict that whitebark pine will be extirpated from most of its current range as temperatures rise over the next 70 years. However, the same models indicate that a large area within northwestern British Columbia, Canada, is climatically suitable for the species under current conditions and will remain so throughout the 21st century. To test the capacity of whitebark pine to establish relative to Climatic and habitat features within its predicted climatic range, we planted seeds from seven populations in eight locations spanning from 600 km southeast to 800 km northwest of the northern boundary of the current species range. During the first three growing seasons, germination occurred in all locations. Nearly three times as many treated (induced maturation and broken dormancy) than untreated seeds germinated, and most treated seeds germinated a year earlier than the untreated seeds. Germination, survival, and growth were primarily influenced by seed mass, site climate conditions related to the duration of snow cover, and provenance temperature. Our experiment provides a preliminary test of models predicting the existence of climatically suitable whitebark pine habitat north of the current species ranges. More broadly, our techniques and results inform the development of scientific guidelines for assisting the migration of other species that are highly threatened by climate change. Applied case studies of this kind are critical for assessing the utility of species distribution models as conservation planning tools.																	1051-0761					JAN	2012	22	1					142	153		10.1890/11-0329.1								WOS:000301095600011	22471080

However, the movement of people and cargo associated with national scientific programs and tourism render Antarctica much more accessible to exotic organisms. Both the transport routes and carriers are varied. The wide range of uses to which timber is put means that it is readily freighted to Antarctic stations. However, it can harbor numerous alien organisms. All the timber materials transported to the "Arctowski" station for the 32nd Polish Antarctic Expedition in the 2007/2008 season were scanned as a potential vector for alien species. This study focuses on the non-lichenized fungi and insects which were found on the timber. Four species of perithecia-forming Ascomycota, five species of corticioid and polyporoid Basidiomycota, four unidentified basidiomycetes taxa in form of sterile mycelia, and two insects belonging to Cerambycidae, were detected. Most of these 'hitch-hikers' were connected with the untreated parts of the timber. Their enduring survival in harsh Antarctic conditions is regarded as highly improbable. Nevertheless, some ascocarps frequently contained vital spores, and live insect larvae and imago were found in hibernation. The results also emphasize that such organisms can be accidentally transported to Antarctica and that the elementary rules for the eventual safe transport of non-infected goods should be obeyed and respected.

It begins by considering how disciplinary power has been reconfigured and revalorized by gentrification, including the deployment of "neo-disciplinary power" to control those outside the Devington Park boundary so as to maintain the positional good of security offered by the development. The paper then moves to consider the influence of gentrification on participant psychogeographies, demonstrating how the preservation paradox has engendered a shift from dormant to active participation. In terms of Tuan's (1974) concept of topophilia Devington Park has become nostalgically haunted by "past structures of meaning and material presences from other times and lives" (Till 2005:9)																	1403-6096	1651-2278					2012	29	1					114	139		10.1080/14036096.2011.600773								WOS:000209096200011

Merr.), a typical short-day (SD) dicot, by switching from SD to long-day (LD) photoperiods. This process may involve florigen, putatively encoded by FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, little is known about the potential function of soybean FT homologs in flowering reversion. Methods: A photoperiod-responsive FT homologue GmFT (renamed as GmFT2a hereafter) was cloned from the photoperiod-sensitive cultivar Zigongdongdou. GmFT2a gene expression under different photoperiods was analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR. In situ hybridization showed direct evidence for its expression during flowering-related processes. GmFT2a was shown to promote flowering using transgenic studies in Arabidopsis and soybean. The effects of photoperiod and temperature on GmFT2a expression were also analyzed in two cultivars with different photoperiod-sensitivities. Results: GmFT2a expression is regulated by photoperiod. Analyses of GmFT2a transcripts revealed a strong correlation between GmFT2a expression and flowering maintenance. GmFT2a transcripts were observed continuously within the vascular tissue up to the shoot apex during flowering. By contrast, transcripts decreased to undetectable levels during flowering reversion. In grafting experiments, the early-flowering, photoperiod-insensitive stock Heihe27 promotes the appearance of GmFT2a transcripts in the shoot apex of scion Zigongdongdou under noninductive LD conditions. The photothermal effects of GmFT2a expression diversity in cultivars with different photoperiod-sensitivities and a hypothesis is proposed. Conclusion: GmFT2a expression is associated with flowering induction and maintenance. Therefore, GmFT2a is a potential target gene for soybean breeding, with the aim of increasing geographic adaptation of this crop.																	1932-6203					DEC 14	2011	6	12							e29238	10.1371/journal.pone.0029238								WOS:000298369100168	22195028					
J	Yamada, H; Yamamoto, MT				Yamada, Hirokazu; Yamamoto, Masa-Toshi			Association between Circadian Clock Genes and Diapause Incidence in Drosophila triauraria	PLOS ONE												Diapause is an adaptive response triggered by seasonal photoperiodicity to overcome unfavorable seasons. The photoperiodic clock is a system that controls seasonal physiological processes, but our knowledge about its physiological mechanisms and genetic architecture remains incomplete. The circadian clock is another system that controls daily rhythmic physiological phenomena. It has been argued that there is a connection between the two clocks. To examine the genetic connection between them, we analyzed the associations of five circadian clock genes (period, timeless, Clock, cycle and cryptochrome) with the occurrence of diapause in Drosophila triauraria, which shows a robust reproductive diapause with clear photoperiodicity. Non-diapause strains found in low latitudes were compared in genetic crosses with the diapause strain, in which the diapause trait is clearly dominant. Single nucleotide polymorphism and deletion analyses of the five circadian clock genes in backcross progeny revealed that allelic differences in timeless and cryptochrome between the strains were additively associated with the differences in the incidence of diapause. This suggests that there is a molecular link between certain circadian clock genes and the occurrence of diapause.																	1932-6203					DEC 2	2011	6	12							e27493	10.1371/journal.pone.0027493								WOS:000298171400010	22164210

RETENTION AND ADAPTIVENESS OF PHOTOPERIODIC EGG DIAPAUSE IN FLORIDA POPULATIONS OF INVASIVE AEDES ALBOPICTUS	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MOSQUITO CONTROL ASSOCIATION												Female Aedes albopictus, F2-F3 descendents from individuals collected as immatures at 6 geographic sites in the USA during 2008, exposed to short daylengths (10 h of light and 14 h of darkness at 21 degrees C) laid eggs in diapause, whose frequency depended upon population origin. Diapause responses in northern Florida and Illinois were strong, as had been reported approximately 10 years earlier for Ae. albopictus from these regions. For southern Florida, the diapause response was polymorphic, and its mean incidence decreased at 2 of 3 collection sites compared to 10 years earlier. Exposure in the field for 2- to 4-wk intervals in Vero Beach (lat 27 degrees 35'N) during January 2009 revealed that eggs laid by short-day females had significantly higher survivorship, even though <50% were estimated, from laboratory results, to be in diapause. Enhanced desiccation resistance may select for retention of diapause in southern Florida.																	8756-971X					DEC	2011	27	4					433	436		10.2987/11-6164.1								WOS:000306344600014	22329278

In this study, we used three planting methods (dormant-season broadcast, growing-season broadcast and growing-season drill) fully crossed with three levels of seed species richness (10, 20, and 34 spp). We replicated the study on nine former agricultural fields located from east-central Iowa (Neal Smith National Wildlife Refuge) to northwestern Minnesota (Litchfield, Fergus Falls and Morris Wetland Management Districts), USA, within the northern tallgrass prairie biome. Objectives were to evaluate the relative influences of planting method, seed mix richness, and their interactions, on (1) planted cover (both total and by guild) and richness, (2) exotic species cover, and (3) non-planted native species cover. Optimal techniques varied between the two study areas: the dormant broadcast method produced greater cover of planted species at the Minnesota sites and the growing-season drill method produced greater cover of planted species at Iowa sites. The dormant broadcast method strongly favored establishment of perennial forbs while the growing-season drill favored warm-season grasses. Although increasing richness of the seed mix produced greater planted species richness, this did not result in greater resistance to exotic invasion. We conclude that, if planting during the growing season, drilling seed is preferable to broadcasting, but if the choice is between broadcasting seed in the dormant or growing season, the dormant season is preferred.

Related to these topics, are 3 important concepts: the lower and upper developmental thresholds, which represent the lower and upper limits of thermal range for insects to develop, and the critical photoperiod, which causes diapause in 50% of a population. To compare lower or upper developmental thresholds of 2 different developmental stages or of 2 populations at the same developmental stage is difficult because of the lack of a suitable statistical method. Shi et al. (2010) proposed 2 methods for testing whether there is a significant difference between 2 lower developmental thresholds. However, these 2 methods are only applicable to the linear relationship between developmental rate and temperature. There are also many studies on the geographic variation in the critical photoperiods for different populations of an insect species. Also, a method is lacking for testing whether there is a significant difference between 2 critical photoperiods. In this study, we test bootstrap to determine if there is a significant difference between different parameters. Bootstrap can then be used to compare any 2 lower or upper developmental thresholds, or to compare 2 critical photoperiods. It can also provide the confidence interval of a critical photoperiod.																	0015-4040					DEC	2011	94	4					1036	1041		10.1653/024.094.0442								WOS:000298451200042

Diuraphis noxia: reproductive behaviour in Argentina	BULLETIN OF INSECTOLOGY												Diuraphis noxia (Kurdjumov) (Rhynchota Aphididae) is an important aphid pest of wheat and barley crops in many countries. Populations of Russian wheat aphid (RWA) from different origins show different reproductive behaviour, but the situation in Argentina was unknown. The aim of the current research was to determine the reproductive behaviour of RWA in Argentina based on samples from populations at six different localities with contrasting land use, altitude and climate. RWA were collected from cultivated and wild grasses from February to December 2005, and 10-15 colonies of aphids were established by collecting parthenogenetic adult females from each population. These colonies were kept under natural conditions at La Plata (36 degrees 36' South Latitude) from 21 December 2005 to 21 December 2007. In more than half of the colonies, oviparous females and eggs were recorded in both years when temperatures were low and the photoperiod either short or increasing and relatively long. Consequently, oviparous females and eggs were recorded from early autumn (April) until the following spring (October), when day length was 11:33 and 13:44 hours, respectively. In both years the temperature and the altitude at the place of origin were highly correlated with the timing of sexual development. The production of eggs enables RWA to survive periods of adverse conditions and generate variability. Thus, by reproducing sexually, RWA may be able to adapt to new environmental conditions and give rise to new, more aggressive biotypes, which can overcome the current resistant varieties of wheat.																	1721-8861					DEC	2011	64	2					235	241										WOS:000298339400013

Consequences of Habitat Fragmentation for the Prairie-Endemic Weevil Haplorhynchites aeneus	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												Widespread destruction of tallgrass prairies in the midwestern United States has fragmented plant communities with the result that populations of endemic animal species have become geographically isolated from one another. The goal of the research summarized here was to evaluate the potential for conserving endemic prairie species of herbivorous insects by managing their host plants. Our study species was the weevil Haplorhynchites aeneus (Boehman), adults of which feed on pollen of plants in the genus Silphium (Asteraceae: Heliantheae). The female weevils clip the peduncles of flower heads and oviposit into the heads, where the larvae feed on the ovules. The research was conducted in 12 prairie sites in eastern Illinois. An allozyme analysis revealed that most populations of H. aeneus at the various prairie sites were genetically differentiated from one another, but the degree of differentiation was not associated with geographic distance between sites. Adult H. aeneus fed and oviposited on the plant species Silphium laciniatum L., S. integrifolium Michx., and S. terebinthinaceum Jacq, which differ in bloom phenology. There was no evidence of genetic differentiation of weevil populations with respect to host plant species, and adult weevils strongly preferred S. terebinthinaceum. We conclude that the oligophagous nature of the weevil assures its survival in small prairie remnants even where some of the host plant species are absent. Although H. aeneus can have a significant impact on reproduction of host plants by clipping flower heads, the perennial nature of Silphium species prevents their local extinction.

Seasonal variation of whole body supercooling points (SCPs), LT50 (temperature at which 50% of the test individuals die) and survival rate after exposure to subzero temperatures were determined in field collected adults during October 2008 to May 2009 and October 2009 to May 2010. The SCP of adults decreased significantly from October (median = -13.8 degrees C) to January (median = -20.7 degrees C) in first year, relatively similar results was observed in the second year. The lowest LT observed in overwintering adults collected in January (-16.81 degrees C) in the first year and December (-15.59 degrees C) in the second year. Mortality at -15 degrees C for 24 h was >70% in early autumn in both years whereas it decreased to lower than 45% in early winter, the highest mortality (100%) was observed in adults collected in May in both years. Cold acclimated adults (30 d, 5 degrees C) in November 2008 exhibited significantly higher SCP (-12.21 +/- 0.64 degrees C) than nonacclimated adults (-15.57 +/- 1.35 degrees C). A 30-d exposure to 5 degrees C caused >20% mortality in November, while <9% mortality was observed in adults collected in December and January 2008. Overwintering adults died upon freezing and the lower lethal temperatures were within the range of SCP, indicating that X. luteola is a freeze intolerant insect.

Modelling the local spread of invasive plants: importance of including spatial distribution and detectability in management plans	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. The success of locally applied treatments for exotic weed control depends on the effectiveness of the method used and workers' abilities to find plants within infested sites. Detectability of exotic plants, however, depends on aspects of a plant's spatial distribution such as the number and size of patches. We lack an explicit examination of how incomplete detection affects the spread of exotic weeds under a range of realistic field conditions. 2. We developed a model of spatial spread of the exotic plant, Lespedeza cuneata, based on 3 years of data in a Kansas, USA, grassland. We then expanded and generalized the model to study how treatment intensity, spatial distribution of stems and detectability influenced control efforts. 3. When left untreated, occupancy and abundance were higher with randomly distributed infestations than with patchy distributions. Control treatments slowed spread, but only the most intense treatments reduced occupancy and abundance. 4. The greatest spread occurred when low detectability was accompanied with low treatment intensity because many small patches were not treated; this phenomenon was particularly common with random spatial distributions that initially lacked large, easily detectable patches. In contrast, high treatment intensity led to similarly slow spread for both spatial patterns and a range of detectability functions. 5. Synthesis and applications. We developed a model to simultaneously manipulate the spatial distribution of the invading plant, the intensity of control methods used to manage the population and the detectability of occupied areas at a site; different combinations of these three factors led to very different rates of exotic spread. Managers will reasonably try to implement intensive weed control. However, poor timing of treatments, for example, could lead to variation in treatment effectiveness. To maximize success, managers should explicitly consider detectability, especially where small patches are scattered throughout a site. To quantify the probability of detection, managers could perform multiple observer surveys; such information could help to determine the effort needed for effective control. Creating weed maps may increase the detection of existing patches from year to year, but workers would still need to search the entire site for new or previously undetected patches.																	0021-8901					DEC	2011	48	6					1391	1400		10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.02050.x								WOS:000297416300009

The effect of temperature and exposure to Beauveria bassiana on tarnished plant bug Lygus lineolaris (Heteroptera: Miridae) population dynamics, and the broader implications of treating insects with entomopathogenic fungi over a range of temperatures	BIOLOGICAL CONTROL												Tarnished plant bugs, Lygus lineolaris (Palisot de Beauvois) (Heteroptera, Miridae) are a major pest of cotton in most cotton growing regions of the Southern US. Studies were conducted to investigate how temperature and Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuilllemin infection impacted L. lineolaris fecundity and longevity, with the goal of determining what temperatures optimized B. bassiana's control potential. B. bassiana-treated adult females and controls were maintained at constant 18 degrees C, 21 degrees C, 25 degrees C, 30 degrees C or 32 degrees C. The number of eggs laid was determined daily until death. B. bassiana caused large reductions in the total number of eggs laid (45-76%) at all temperatures; however, there was no effect of infection on the daily rate of egg production. There was not a sub-lethal effect of infection on egg production on the last full day of life. Intrinsic rates of natural increase and population doubling times were marginally affected by treatment with B. bassiana; doubling times increased with treatment a mean of 3.5 days (range 0.5-7.7 days). There was a temperature dependent trend in the length of the preoviposition period and the days to death after treatment with B. bassiana. As temperature increased from 18 degrees C to 32 degrees C, the number of days to death converged on the preoviposition period. The maximum difference was observed at 18 degrees C (5.3 days different) compared to 30 degrees C and 32 degrees C (0.3 days). These results strongly suggested that treatment of tarnished plant bugs with B. bassiana should be performed when plant bugs are in diapause or when temperatures are cool to minimize reproduction during the disease incubation period.

Data logging of body temperatures provides precise information on phenology of reproductive events in a free-living arctic hibernator	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY												Precise measures of phenology are critical to understanding how animals organize their annual cycles and how individuals and populations respond to climate-induced changes in physical and ecological stressors. We show that patterns of core body temperature (T (b)) can be used to precisely determine the timing of key seasonal events including hibernation, mating and parturition, and immergence and emergence from the hibernacula in free-living arctic ground squirrels (Urocitellus parryii). Using temperature loggers that recorded T (b) every 20 min for up to 18 months, we monitored core T (b) from three females that subsequently gave birth in captivity and from 66 female and 57 male ground squirrels free-living in the northern foothills of the Brooks Range Alaska. In addition, dates of emergence from hibernation were visually confirmed for four free-living male squirrels. Average T (b) in captive females decreased by 0.5-1.0A degrees C during gestation and abruptly increased by 1-1.5A degrees C on the day of parturition. In free-living females, similar shifts in T (b) were observed in 78% (n = 9) of yearlings and 94% (n = 31) of adults; females without the shift are assumed not to have given birth. Three of four ground squirrels for which dates of emergence from hibernation were visually confirmed did not exhibit obvious diurnal rhythms in T (b) until they first emerged onto the surface when T (b) patterns became diurnal. In free-living males undergoing reproductive maturation, this pre-emergence euthermic interval averaged 20.4 days (n = 56).

Presently, there is limited understanding of the relationships between cues and optimal timing, and especially about how this relationship will be affected by environmental changes. We develop a general model to explore the relation between a cue and the optimal timing of an important life history activity. The model quantifies the fitness loss for organisms failing to time behaviours optimally. We decompose the immediate change in fitness resulting from environmental changes into a component that is due to changes in the predictive power of the cue and a component that derives from the mismatch of the old response to the cue to the new environmental conditions. Our results show that consequences may range from negative, neutral to positive and are highly dependent on how cue and optimal timing and their relation are specifically affected by environmental changes.

J	Musolin, DL; Tougou, D; Fujisaki, K				Musolin, Dmitry L.; Tougou, Daisuke; Fujisaki, Kenji			Photoperiodic response in the subtropical and warm-temperate zone populations of the southern green stink bug Nezara viridula: why does it not fit the common latitudinal trend?	PHYSIOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												The photoperiodic response of diapause induction is studied in females of five subtropical and warm-temperate zone populations of Nezara viridula (L.) (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae) in Japan (26.4-34.7 degrees N; 127.4-135.7 degrees E). Laboratory tests at 25 degrees C demonstrate that both warm-temperate and subtropical populations have pronounced photoperiodic responses of adult diapause induction. Under short-day conditions (LD 10 : 14 h), 73-100% of females enter diapause, whereas, under long-day conditions (LD 15 : 9 h), 87-100% of females are nondiapause and reproduce. When the critical photoperiod for diapause induction is plotted against the latitude of origin of each population, the data points do not show the expected tendency of increasing critical photoperiod northwards but, instead, vary between 12 h 15 min and 13 h 30 min. It is suggested that adults from different populations of such a highly migratory species move often among subtropical islands (by themselves or being assisted by typhoons), thus constantly destabilizing the photoperiodic responses. Although important for general synchronization of seasonal development in the tropics and subtropics, winter diapause might not be so critical for survival in mild winters in these zones. Such circumstances might make the selective pressure over the photoperiodic response less severe in the tropics and subtropics than in the temperate zone. It is suggested that the current climate warming might contribute to this situation as well by promoting polewards migrations and lessening the selective pressure of overwintering conditions.

Biomass estimated over 10 months reached a maximum of 0.732 kg m(-2) in February. Aggregations were encountered only in the presence of an ice cover from December to April. The vertical extent of the aggregations was dictated by temperature and zooplankton prey distribution. In winter, polar cod generally occupied the relatively warm deep Atlantic Layer (> 0A degrees C), but a fraction of the densest aggregations occasionally followed zooplankton prey up into the cold Pacific Halocline (-1.6 to 0A degrees C). The diel vertical migration of polar cod was precisely synchronized with the seasonally increasing photoperiod. Throughout winter, polar cod aggregations migrated to progressively deeper regions (from 220 to 550 m bottom depths) in response to increasing light intensity, presumably to avoid predation by visual predators such as the ringed seal. Comparing Amundsen Gulf and Franklin Bay indicates that the entrapment of polar cod in embayments during winter is an important mechanism to provide marine mammal predators with dense concentrations of their main prey within their diving range.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				DEC	2011	34	12					1959	1971		10.1007/s00300-011-1019-9								WOS:000297203500013

The solitary bee Osmia lignaria winters as a pre-emergent adult, and requires a period of cold temperature for winter diapause completion. It is a univoltine species, and diapause induction does not depend on photoperiod. To understand the potential effects of longer summers on O. lignaria populations, we exposed individuals to three treatments simulating early, mid and late winter arrivals, and measured respiration rates, metabolic expenditure, weight loss, fat body depletion, lipid levels and winter mortality. The early-winter treatment disrupted diapause development, but had no apparent negative effects on fitness. In contrast, late-winter bees had a greater energetic expenditure (1.5-fold), weight (1.4-fold) and lipid (2-fold) loss, greater fat body depletion, and a 19% increase in mortality compared to mid-winter bees. We also monitored adult eclosion and arrival of winter temperatures under natural conditions in four years. We found a positive correlation between mean degree-day accumulation during pre-wintering (a measure of asynchrony between adult eclosion and winter arrival) and yearly winter mortality. Individually, bees experiencing greater degree-day accumulations exhibited reduced post-winter longevity. Timing of adult eclosion in O. lignaria is dependent on the duration of the prepupal period, which occurs in mid-summer, is also diapause-mediated, and is longer in populations from southerly latitudes. In a global warming scenario, we expect long summer diapause phenotypes to replace short summer diapause phenotypes, effectively maintaining short pre-wintering periods in spite of delayed winter arrivals.

However, despite its importance to agriculture, public health and scientific and medical research, surprisingly few studies have focused on wild brown rat populations. There are four subspecies in China, but little is known about their original distributions. In the present study, we investigated the seasonal biological and ecological characteristics of brown rats in their native range in Harbin, north-eastern China. Trapping campaigns were conducted in June and November 2006 at a farm site and a rice site, and seasonal variation was analysed. The sex ratio was male biased at the farm site and female biased at the rice site in both seasons. Although juvenile, sub-adult and young-adult rats comprised over 80% of the population in both seasons, the age composition displayed seasonal differences, with higher proportions of juvenile rats in the summer and sub-adults in the winter. There were no significant morphological differences between different sexes or seasons, or between sites. Heavy, female and pregnant rats were captured first and heavier male rats maintained relatively higher reproductive activities than lighter ones, reflecting the link between social dominance and feeding priority. Rats had heavier reproductive organs in summer than in winter. The relative masses of the spleen and adrenal glands also showed seasonal and gender differences. This study demonstrates that brown rats in their native region have similar seasonal biological and ecological characteristics to American and European populations. This information on brown rat in north-east China will contribute to the development of management strategies for controlling this agricultural pest.																	1612-4758					DEC	2011	84	4					409	418		10.1007/s10340-011-0379-9								WOS:000297136500002

For its sensitivity to winter and early spring temperatures, the timing of cherry blossoms is an ideal indicator of the impacts of climate change on tree phenology. Here, we applied a process-based phenology model for temperate deciduous trees to predict peak bloom dates (PBD) of flowering cherry trees (Prunus x yedoensis 'Yoshino' and Prunus serrulata 'Kwanzan') in the Tidal Basin, Washington, DC and the surrounding Mid-Atlantic States in response to climate change. We parameterized the model with observed PBD data from 1991 to 2010. The calibrated model was tested against independent datasets of the past PBD data from 1951 to 1970 in the Tidal Basin and more recent PBD data from other locations (e.g., Seattle, WA). The model performance against these independent data was satisfactory (Yoshino: r(2) = 0.57, RMSE = 6.6 days, bias = 0.9 days and Kwanzan: r(2) = 0.76, RMSE = 5.5 days, bias = -2.0 days). We then applied the model to forecast future PBD for the region using downscaled climate projections based on IPCC's A1B and A2 emissions scenarios. Our results indicate that PBD at the Tidal Basin are likely to be accelerated by an average of five days by 2050 s and 10 days by 2080 s for these cultivars under a mid-range (A1B) emissions scenario projected by ECHAM5 general circulation model. The acceleration is likely to be much greater (13 days for 2050 s and 29 days for 2080s) under a higher (A2) emissions scenario projected by CGCM2 general circulation model. Our results demonstrate the potential impacts of climate change on the timing of cherry blossoms and illustrate the utility of a simple process-based phenology model for developing adaptation strategies to climate change in horticulture, conservation planning, restoration and other related disciplines.

Evolutionary history of barley cultivation in Europe revealed by genetic analysis of extant landraces	BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY												Background: Understanding the evolution of cultivated barley is important for two reasons. First, the evolutionary relationships between different landraces might provide information on the spread and subsequent development of barley cultivation, including the adaptation of the crop to new environments and its response to human selection. Second, evolutionary information would enable landraces with similar traits but different genetic backgrounds to be identified, providing alternative strategies for the introduction of these traits into modern germplasm. Results: The evolutionary relationships between 651 barley landraces were inferred from the genotypes for 24 microsatellites. The landraces could be divided into nine populations, each with a different geographical distribution. Comparisons with ear row number, caryopsis structure, seasonal growth habit and flowering time revealed a degree of association between population structure and phenotype, and analysis of climate variables indicated that the landraces are adapted, at least to some extent, to their environment. Human selection and/or environmental adaptation may therefore have played a role in the origin and/or maintenance of one or more of the barley landrace populations. There was also evidence that at least some of the population structure derived from geographical partitioning set up during the initial spread of barley cultivation into Europe, or reflected the later introduction of novel varieties. In particular, three closely-related populations were made up almost entirely of plants with the daylength nonresponsive version of the photoperiod response gene PPD-H1, conferring adaptation to the long annual growth season of northern Europe. These three populations probably originated in the eastern Fertile Crescent and entered Europe after the initial spread of agriculture. Conclusions: The discovery of population structure, combined with knowledge of associated phenotypes and environmental adaptations, enables a rational approach to identification of landraces that might be used as sources of germplasm for breeding programs. The population structure also enables hypotheses concerning the prehistoric spread and development of agriculture to be addressed.

Assessing fitness of dormancy from reproductive values of dormant plants	EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH												Questions: How can the fitness of dormancy as a life-history trait be assessed? Can comparisons of reproductive values between dormant and active plants be used as proxies for fitness comparisons of life histories with dormancy versus without dormancy? Must dormancy be a bet-hedge for it to be adaptive in cases where reproductive values of dormant plants are lower than for active plants? Mathematical methods: Comparison of reproductive values and fitness across a range of variables using demographic population matrix modelling. Key assumptions: Plastic phenotypes include dormancy in their life-history repertoire, while static phenotypes do not. These phenotypes have different fitness. The environment is heterogeneous such that individuals within a population experience different conditions in both deterministic and stochastic environments. Active plants have higher reproductive values in good sites and lower reproductive values in bad sites compared with dormant plants. Environments vary in their proportion of good sites as defined above. Phenotypes that include dormancy vary in the probability that an individual will go dormant when in a bad site. Conclusions: To assess the fitness of dormancy as a life-history trait, one must know the proportion of good sites in the environment and the response accuracy of the plastic phenotype to environmental variation. The fitness of dormancy in a life-history repertoire cannot be determined solely from comparing reproductive values or their components between dormant and vegetative plants. Likewise, dormancy cannot be assessed as a bet-hedging mechanism without knowledge of variation in environmental conditions and plant responses to that variation.

J	Schulze, K; Borken, W; Matzner, E				Schulze, Kerstin; Borken, Werner; Matzner, Egbert			Dynamics of dissolved organic C-14 in throughfall and soil solution of a Norway spruce forest	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is an important component of the C cycle in forest ecosystems, but dynamics and origin of DOC in throughfall and soil solution are yet poorly understood. In a 2-year study, we analyzed the radiocarbon signature of DOC in throughfall and soil solution beneath the Oa horizon and at 90 cm depth in a Norway spruce forest on a Podzol soil. A two-pool mixing model revealed that throughfall DOC comprised mainly biogenic C, i.e. recently fixed C, from canopy leaching and possibly other sources. The contribution of fossil DOC from atmospheric deposition to throughfall DOC was on average 6% with maxima of 8-11% during the dormant season. In soil solution from the Oa horizon, (DOC)-C-14 signature was highly dynamic (range from -8aEuro degrees to +103aEuro degrees), but not correlated with DOC concentration. Radiocarbon signatures suggest that DOC beneath the Oa horizon originated mainly from occluded and mineral associated organic matter fractions of the Oa horizon rather than from the Oi or Oe horizon. Relatively old C was released in the rewetting phase following a drought period in the late summer of 2006. In contrast, the (DOC)-C-14 signature indicated the release of younger C throughout the humid year 2007. In soil solutions from 90 cm depth, (DOC)-C-14 signatures were also highly dynamic (-127aEuro degrees to +3aEuro degrees) despite constantly low DOC concentrations. Similar to the Oa horizon, the lowest (DOC)-C-14 signature at 90 cm depth was found after the rewetting phase in the late summer of 2006. Because of the variation in the (DOC)-C-14 signatures at this depth, we conclude that DOC was not equilibrated with the surrounding soil, but also originated from overlaying soil horizons. The dynamics of (DOC)-C-14 in throughfall and soil solution suggest that the sources of DOC are highly variable in time. Extended drought periods likely have a strong influence on release and translocation of DOC from relatively old and possibly stabilized soil organic matter fractions. Temporal variations as well as the input of fossil DOC needs to be considered when calibrating DOC models based on (DOC)-C-14 signatures.																	0168-2563					NOV	2011	106	3					461	473		10.1007/s10533-010-9526-2								WOS:000297360300011

Northern Pacific Rattlesnakes (Crotalus oreganus) use thermal and structural cues to choose overwintering hibernacula	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE												Hibernacula play an important role in the ecology of high-latitude snakes, and communally denning species may occupy their hibernacula for half the year or more. Because of the long duration spent at hibernacula, such sites can provide multiple benefits to snakes including shelter from lethal overwinter conditions, social opportunities, and basking sites important in thermoregulation. Adequate hibernacula seem to be limited on the landscape and individuals travel several kilometres to use and reuse specific sites. We investigate orientation, physical structure, and thermal properties of sites used as hibernacula by Northern Pacific Rattlesnakes (Crotalus oreganus Holbrook, 1840), and compare them with random sites that appear to be similar but were not used for hibernation. Hibernacula occurred primarily on south-facing talus slopes, were oriented on less-steep slopes, and were composed of rocks that were intermediate in size to randomly occurring sites. Our results suggest that the orientation and physical composition of hibernacula allow them to he stable over time, allowing snakes to repeatedly locate the sites, as well as providing predictable overwinter refuge. Hibernacula were also warmer on the surface than north-facing random sites and provided increased basking opportunities for snakes thermoregulating in early spring after emergence from hibernation.

Disc achenes are nondormant, and seeds germinate over a wide range of temperature conditions, whereas ray achenes are dormant at maturity and require after-ripening before seed germination.

Multistate proteomics analysis reveals novel strategies used by a hibernator to precondition the heart and conserve ATP for winter heterothermy	PHYSIOLOGICAL GENOMICS												The hibernator's heart functions continuously and avoids damage across the wide temperature range of winter heterothermy. To define the molecular basis of this phenotype, we quantified proteomic changes in the 13-lined ground squirrel heart among eight distinct physiological states encompassing the hibernator's year. Unsupervised clustering revealed a prominent seasonal separation between the summer homeotherms and winter heterotherms, whereas within-season state separation was limited. Further, animals torpid in the fall were intermediate to summer and winter, consistent with the transitional nature of this phase. A seasonal analysis revealed that the relative abundances of protein spots were mainly winter-increased. The winter-elevated proteins were involved in fatty acid catabolism and protein folding, whereas the winter-depleted proteins included those that degrade branched-chain amino acids. To identify further state-dependent changes, protein spots were re-evaluated with respect to specific physiological state, confirming the predominance of seasonal differences. Additionally, chaperone and heat shock proteins increased in winter, including HSPA4, HSPB6, and HSP90AB1, which have known roles in protecting against ischemia-reperfusion injury and apoptosis. The most significant and greatest fold change observed was a disappearance of phospho-cofilin 2 at low body temperature, likely a strategy to preserve ATP. The robust summer-to-winter seasonal proteomic shift implies that a winter-protected state is orchestrated before prolonged torpor ensues. Additionally, the general preservation of the proteome during winter hibernation and an increase of stress response proteins, together with dephosphorylation of cofilin 2, highlight the importance of ATP-conserving mechanisms for winter cardioprotection.

Geographic Variation of Photoperiodic Diapause but Not Adult Survival or Reproduction of the Invasive Mosquito Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae) in North America	ANNALS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												Climate differences across latitude can result in seasonal constraints and selection on life-history characters. Because Aedes albopictus (Skuse) invaded North America in the mid-1980s, it has spread across a range of approximate to 14 degrees latitude and populations in the north experience complete adult mortality because of cold winter temperatures that are absent in the south. Life-table experiments were conducted to test for differences in the adult survival and reproductive schedules of Ae. albopictus females from three populations from the northern (Salem, NJ; Springfield, IL; Eureka, MO; approximate to 39 degrees N) and southern (Palm Beach, Palmetto, Tampa, FL; approximate to 27-28 degrees N) extremes of the species distribution in North America. There were consistent differences between northern and southern populations in incidence of photoperiodically-induced egg diapause. Under short daylength, diapause eggs constituted twice the proportion of total viable eggs from northern females (81.9-92.1%) than southern females (35.9-42.7%). There were no consistent differences between northern and southern populations in resource allocation between reproduction and maintenance, reproduction over time, and reproductive investment among offspring, and no apparent trade-offs between diapause incidence with reproduction or longevity. Our results suggest that the main response of North American Ae. albopictus to unfavorable winter climates is via the life history strategy of producing diapausing eggs, rather than quantitative variation in reproduction, and that there are no detectable costs to adult survival. Inherent geographic variation in the expression of diapause, consistent with the latitudinal extremes of A. albopictus, indicates evolutionary loss of diapause response in southern populations because of the invasion of A. albopictus in North America.																	0013-8746					NOV	2011	104	6					1309	1318		10.1603/AN11032								WOS:000297163900021	22707762

Temperature, recreational fishing and diapause egg connections: dispersal of spiny water fleas (Bythotrephes longimanus)	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												The spiny water flea (Bythotrephes longimanus) is spreading from Great Lakes coastal waters into northern inland lakes within a northern temperature-defined latitudinal band. Colonization of Great Lakes coastal embayments is assisted by winds and seiche surges, yet rapid inland expansion across the northern states comes through an overland process. The lack of invasions at Isle Royale National Park contrasts with rapid expansion on the nearby Keweenaw Peninsula. Both regions have comparable geology, lake density, and fauna, but differ in recreational fishing boat access, visitation, and containment measures. Tail spines protect Bythotrephes against young of the year, but not larger fish, yet the unusual thick-shelled diapausing eggs can pass through fish guts in viable condition. Sediment traps illustrate how fish spread diapausing eggs across lakes in fecal pellets. Trillions of diapausing eggs are produced per year in Lake Michigan and billions per year in Lake Michigamme, a large inland lake. Dispersal by recreational fishing is linked to use of baitfish, diapausing eggs defecated into live wells and bait buckets, and Bythothephes snagged on fishing line, anchor ropes, and minnow seines. Relatively simple measures, such as on-site rinsing of live wells, restricting transfer of certain baitfish species, or holding baitfish for 24 h (defecation period), should greatly reduce dispersal.

J	Brown, ME; Branstrator, DK				Brown, Meghan E.; Branstrator, Donn K.			Patterns in the abundance, phenology, and hatching of the resting egg stage of the invasive zooplankter Bythotrephes longimanus: implications for establishment	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												To examine how dormancy contributes to the establishment and persistence of Bythotrephes longimanus, we investigated resting egg production and hatching in relation to the demography of the planktonic stage and environmental conditions in Island Lake Reservoir (USA). During a 3-year study, the largest contribution to the egg bank occurred in autumn and most eggs hatched in spring, but we also detected some resting egg production and hatching in summer. The difference between summer and late autumn densities of eggs in sediments averaged 47% (range 0-98%) for 18 sites throughout the reservoir, which was similar to experimental estimates of in situ hatching fraction of 67% for eggs in the spring and summer following their production. Based on emergence traps, neonates hatch in the field during May and June. We estimated mortality rates of 64% for resting eggs and embryos, and 59% for newly emerged neonates. Although hatching fraction saturated at the same level, eggs incubated offshore hatched later than those nearshore where water temperature was warmer and light was detectable at the sediment surface. Low dissolved oxygen concentration did not significantly reduce hatching fraction but resulted in some eggs that initiated development but failed to hatch. Collectively, our results demonstrate substantial annual turnover in the resting egg bank of B. longimanus and high mortality of resting eggs during recruitment from the egg to the first molt of the planktonic stage. These patterns suggest that propagule pressure in the form of resting eggs requires large numbers for establishment, and that considerable post-establishment resting egg production is necessary for inter-annual persistence.																	1387-3547	1573-1464				NOV	2011	13	11			SI		2547	2559		10.1007/s10530-011-0080-1								WOS:000296352600009

Contrasting sensitivity to extreme winter warming events of dominant sub-Arctic heathland bryophyte and lichen species	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1. Climate change in northern high latitudes is predicted to be greater in winter rather than summer, yet little is known about the effects of winter climate change on northern ecosystems. Among the unknowns are the effects of an increasing frequency of acute, short-lasting winter warming events. Such events can damage higher plants exposed to warm, then returning cold, temperatures after snow melt, and it is not known how bryophytes and lichens, which are of considerable ecological importance in high-latitude ecosystems, are affected by such warming events. However, even physiological adaptations of these cryptogams to winter environments in general are poorly understood. 2. Here we describe findings from a novel field experiment that uses heating from infrared lamps and soil warming cables to simulate acute mid-winter warming events in a sub-Arctic heath. In particular, we report the growing season responses of the dominant lichen, Peltigera aphthosa, and bryophyte, Hylocomium splendens, to warming events in three consecutive winters. 3. While summertime photosynthetic performance of P. aphthosa was unaffected by the winter warming treatments, H. splendens showed significant reductions in net photosynthetic rates and growth rates (of up to 48% and 52%, respectively). Negative effects were evident already during the summer following the first winter warming event. 4. While the lichen develops without going through critical phenological stages during which vulnerable organs are produced, the moss has a seasonal rhythm, which includes initiation of growth of young, freeze-susceptible shoot apices in the early growing season; these might be damaged by breaking of dormancy during warm winter events. 5. Synthesis. Different sensitivities of the bryophyte and lichen species were unexpected, and illustrate that very little is known about the winter ecology of bryophytes and lichens from cold biomes in general. In sharp contrast to summer warming experiments that show increased vascular plant biomass and reduced lichen biomass, these results demonstrate that acute climate events in midwinter may be readily tolerated by lichens, in contrast to previously observed sensitivity of co-occurring dwarf shrubs, suggesting winter climate change may compensate for (or even reverse) predicted lichen declines resulting from summer warming.

Adaptive Thermoregulation in Endotherms May Alter Responses to Climate Change	INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY					Annual Meeting of the Society-for-Integrative-and-Comparative-Biology	JAN 03-07, 2011	Salt Lake City, UT	Soc Integrat & Comparat Biol (SICB)				Climate change is one of the major issues facing natural populations and thus a focus of recent research has been to predict the responses of organisms to these changes. Models are becoming more complex and now commonly include physiological traits of the organisms of interest. However, endothermic species have received less attention than have ectotherms in these mechanistic models. Further, it is not clear whether responses of endotherms to climate change are modified by variation in thermoregulatory characteristics associated with phenotypic plasticity and/or adaptation to past selective pressures. Here, we review the empirical data on thermal adaptation and acclimatization in endotherms and discuss how those factors may be important in models of responses to climate change. We begin with a discussion of why thermoregulation and thermal sensitivity at high body temperatures should be co-adapted. Importantly, we show that there is, in fact, considerable variation in the ability of endotherms to tolerate high body temperatures and/or high environmental temperatures, but a better understanding of this variation will likely be critical for predicting responses to future climatic scenarios. Next, we discuss why variation in thermoregulatory characteristics should be considered when modeling the effects of climate change on heterothermic endotherms. Finally, we review some biophysical and biochemical factors that will limit adaptation and acclimation in endotherms. We consider both long-term, directional climate change and short-term (but increasingly common) anomalies in climate such as extreme heat waves and we suggest areas of important future research relating to both our basic understanding of endothermic thermoregulation and the responses of endotherms to climate change.

Hedgehog density was estimated from distance sampling surveys applied to 43 line-transects visited monthly in 2006 and 2007. Hedgehogs were detected by using infrared binoculars. They were captured to be sexed, age-classified and marked. Earthworm, arthropod and pet food availability as well as distance to the nearest badger sett were assessed per transect through field sampling. Hedgehog population density, estimated from the detection of 127 hedgehogs, was 4.4 +/- 1.3 individuals km(-2) in the rural area and 36.5 +/- 15.2 individuals km(-2) in the urban area, where transects had lower arthropod biomass, higher pet food availability, and a greater distance from badger setts than in rural area. Adult hedgehog abundance was predicted by earthworm biomass and pet food availability. The number of young per adult female was predicted by arthropod biomass and distance to the nearest badger sett. The high urban hedgehog density did not seem to be mainly induced by an increase in reproductive rate and cannot be fully explained by food resource availability. The effect of variations in road kills and winter mortality factors between urban and rural area are discussed. We concluded that the combination of anthropogenic food and sheltered climatic conditions may provide good situations for hedgehogs and other hibernator species in urbanised environment.

Growth and development of the coffee plant	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												This paper is the first of three on the coffee production system consisting of (1) the coffee plant, (2) coffee berry borer (CBB) and (3) the role of CBB parasitoids. A previous simulation model of the coffee plant was developed using data from Brazil where coffee phenology is characterized by distinct seasonal flowering (Gutierrez et al., 1998). In contrast, flowering in Colombia is continuous with low seasonality. To capture the differences in coffee phenology and growth in the two climatic regions, the Gutierrez et al. (1998) model was modified using new data from Colombia. The modifications to the model include: (1) The effect of solar radiation on floral buds initiation; (2) An age structure population model to track the daily input and development of the floral buds; (3) The effect of leaf water potential on breaking dormancy in flower buds, and hence on the timing and intensity of flowering; (4) The incorporation of both the vegetative and the reproductive demands to predict the photosynthetic rate. (5) The effect of low temperature on photosynthesis and defoliation. Other aspects of the model were re-interpreted and refinements made to generalize its structure for use across coffee varieties and geographic areas. The model, without modification, realistically simulates field data from Brazil and two Colombian locations having different varieties, patterns of rainfall and hence flowering phenology. The model will be used as the base trophic level for incorporating CBB and high tropic levels effects, and for the analysis of management options in the coffee production system.

Its central position in the food web, the ongoing environmental changes due to climatic warming, and increasing commercial interest on this species emphasize the urgency of understanding the adaptability of krill to its environment. Krill has evolved rhythmic physiological and behavioral functions which are synchronized with the daily and seasonal cycles of the complex Southern Ocean ecosystem. The mechanisms, however, leading to these rhythms are essentially unknown. Here, we show that krill possesses an endogenous circadian clock that governs metabolic and physiological output rhythms. We found that expression of the canonical clock gene cry2 was highly rhythmic both in a light-dark cycle and in constant darkness. We detected a remarkable short circadian period, which we interpret as a special feature of the krill's circadian clock that helps to entrain the circadian system to the extreme range of photoperiods krill is exposed to throughout the year. Furthermore, we found that important key metabolic enzymes of krill showed bimodal circadian oscillations (similar to 9-12 h period) in transcript abundance and enzymatic activity. Oxygen consumption of krill showed similar to 9-12 h oscillations that correlated with the temporal activity profile of key enzymes of aerobic energy metabolism. Our results demonstrate the first report of an endogenous circadian timing system in Antarctic krill and its likely link to metabolic key processes. Krill's circadian clock may not only be critical for synchronization to the solar day but also for the control of seasonal events. This study provides a powerful basis for the investigation into the mechanisms of temporal synchronization in this marine key species and will also lead to the first comprehensive analyses of the circadian clock of a polar marine organism through the entire photoperiodic cycle.

Day length is sensed by the leaves, which produce a mobile signal transported to the shoot apex or underground stems to induce a flowering transition or, respectively, a tuberization transition. Work in Arabidopsis, tomato and rice (Oryza sativa) identified the mobile FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) protein as a main component of the long-range 'florigen', or flowering hormone, signal(1-3). Here we show that expression of the Hd3a gene, the FT orthologue in rice, induces strict short-day potato types(4) to tuberize in long days. Tuber induction is graft transmissible and the Hd3a-GFP protein is detected in the stolons of grafted plants, transport of the fusion protein thus correlating with tuber formation. We provide evidence showing that the potato floral and tuberization transitions are controlled by two different FT-like paralogues (StSP3D and StSP6A) that respond to independent environmental cues, and show that an autorelay mechanism involving CONSTANS modulates expression of the tuberization-control StSP6A gene.

In such habitats with such fluctuating environmental conditions, dominant individuals in social species often monopolise safe microhabitats and food resources, which may lead to greater levels of stress in subordinates. The results of this study revealed that certain haematological indices of health state and body condition of wintering Great Tits (Parus major) were dependent on their sex and age under conditions of extreme ambient temperature. Heterophil and lymphocyte counts revealed a significant increase in heterophil/lymphocyte ratio (H/L) in female Great Tits during the course of cold spell, where the increase was detected mainly in the first year females. We also found that the condition of pectoral muscle during the cold spells deteriorated only in females, especially in the first year individuals. Since sex appears to be the most important predictor of the dominance rank and survival in Great Tit winter groups, elevated physiological stress in adult and first year females during cold spells may be explained in terms of increased resource monopolisation by dominant individuals.																	0021-8375					OCT	2011	152	4					889	895		10.1007/s10336-011-0672-7								WOS:000296073300007						
J	Sandrock, C; Razmjou, J; Vorburger, C				Sandrock, Christoph; Razmjou, Jabraeil; Vorburger, Christoph			Climate effects on life cycle variation and population genetic architecture of the black bean aphid, Aphis fabae	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Aphid species may exhibit different reproductive modes ranging from cyclical to obligate parthenogenesis. The distribution of life cycle variation in aphids is generally determined by ecological forces, mainly climate, because only sexually produced diapausing eggs can survive harsh winters or periods of absence of suitable host plants. Aphids are thus interesting models to investigate intrinsic and environmental factors shaping the competition among sexual and asexual lineages. We conducted a Europe-wide sampling of black bean aphids, Aphis fabae, and combined population genetic analyses based on microsatellite data with an experimental determination of life cycle strategies. Aphids were collected from broad beans (Vicia faba) as well as some Chenopodiaceae, but we detected no genetic differentiation between aphids from different host plants. Consistent with model predictions, life cycle variation was related to climate, with aphids from areas with cold winters investing more in sexual reproduction than aphids from areas with mild winters. Accordingly, only populations from mild areas exhibited a clear genetic signature of clonal reproduction. These differences arise despite substantial gene flow over large distances, which was evident from a very low geographic population structure and a lack of isolation-by-distance among 18 sites across distances of more than 1000 km. There was virtually no genetic differentiation between aphids with different reproductive modes, suggesting that new asexual lineages are formed continuously. Indeed, a surprising number of A. fabae genotypes even from colder climates produced some parthenogenetic offspring under simulated winter conditions. From this we predict that a shift to predominantly asexual reproduction could take place rapidly under climate warming.

Emily; Hoikkala, Anneli			Adaptation to a seasonally varying environment: a strong latitudinal cline in reproductive diapause combined with high gene flow in Drosophila montana	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Adaptation to seasonal changes in the northern hemisphere includes an ability to predict the forthcoming cold season from gradual changes in environmental cues early enough to prepare for the harsh winter conditions. The magnitude and speed of changes in these cues vary between the latitudes, which induces strong selection pressures for local adaptation. We studied adaptation to seasonal changes in Drosophila montana, a northern maltfly, by defining the photoperiodic conditions leading to adult reproductive diapause along a latitudinal cline in Finland and by measuring genetic differentiation and the amount of gene flow between the sampling sites with microsatellites. Our data revealed a clear correlation between the latitude and the critical day length (CDL), in which half of the females of different cline populations enter photoperiodic reproductive diapause. There was no sign of limited gene flow between the cline populations, even though these populations showed isolation by distance. Our results show that local adaptation may occur even in the presence of high gene flow, when selection for locally adaptive life-history traits is strong. A wide range of variation in the CDLs of the fly strains within and between the cline populations may be partly due to gene flow and partly due to the opposing selection pressures for fly reproduction and overwinter survival. This variation in the timing of diapause will enhance populations' survival over the years that differ in the severity of the winter and in the length of the warm period and may also help them respond to long-term changes in environmental conditions.

Here, we used eddy covariance measurements of NEE from 20 FLUXNET sites (203 site-years of data) in mid-and high-latitude forests to investigate the temperature response of NEE. Years were divided into two half thermal years (increasing temperature in spring and decreasing temperature in autumn) using the maximum daily mean temperature. We observed a parabolic-like pattern of NEE in response to temperature change in both the spring and autumn half thermal years. However, at similar temperatures, NEE was considerably depressed during the decreasing temperature season as compared with the increasing temperature season, inducing a counter-clockwise hysteresis pattern in the NEE-temperature relation at most sites. The magnitude of this hysteresis was attributable mostly (68%) to gross primary production (GPP) differences but little (8%) to ecosystem respiration (ER) differences between the two half thermal years. The main environmental factors contributing to the hysteresis responses of NEE and GPP were daily accumulated radiation. Soil water content (SWC) also contributed to the hysteresis response of GPP but only at some sites. Shorter day length, lower light intensity, lower SWC and reduced photosynthetic capacity may all have contributed to the depressed GPP and net carbon uptake during the decreasing temperature seasons. The resultant hysteresis loop is an important indicator of the existence of limiting factors. As such, the role of radiation, LAI and SWC should be considered when modeling the dynamics of carbon cycling in response to temperature change.

To provide a first record of the taxa composition and diversity of zooplankton communities, we sampled 15 reservoirs during 2008-2009, from the north of the island to the south, representative of a range of size, depth, renewal time, and trophy. The survey was complemented by seasonal sampling in one of the largest lakes studied. Water samples collected from surface to bottom provided data on hydrochemistry and trophy. Crustacean dormant stages were inspected from sediments of the richest, and most diverse, Lake Sos Canales. RDA suggested that productivity, water depth, renewal time and altitude were the main variables related to taxa composition. The ubiquitous Copidodiaptomus numidicus, and its persistence in the water column, resulted from the production of subitaneous eggs throughout the year, an adaptive strategy in perennial water bodies. Genetic analyses of DNA sequences of the diagnostic gene ND5 placed the Sardinian Daphnia pulex in the North American group. Moreover, the ND5 sequence found in Sardinia was identical with that of an asexual hybrid clone between the American D. pulex and American D. pulicaria that replaced native D. pulex throughout Africa. The presence of this ND5 haplotype in Sardinia shows that this invasive clone also poses an invasive threat to native populations in Europe.

J	Jakalaniemi, A				Jakalaniemi, Anne			Narrow climate and habitat envelope affect the survival of relict populations of a northern Arnica angustifolia	ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY												Many species require certain habitat and climate features, especially at range limits. Because of climate warming, isolated relict southern populations of arctic-alpine species could lose their viability. Arnica angustifolia is a rare, clonal northern plant which has distinct populations far away from its central distribution area. I explored its population viability in relation to habitat properties and local temperature regimes using demographic and temperature data collected during 1996-2009 from six southern populations. The data were analyzed with matrix population modeling. Both projected and stochastic population growth rates showed spatiotemporal variation, and indicated decreasing population trends. The population growth rate was most sensitive to the survival of small sized vegetative rosettes, emphasizing the importance of rosette size for fitness. High temperatures and habitat closure were the main threats to viability of Arnica. First, high temperatures during the previous and current growing seasons had a negative impact on rosette size and survival of ramets. Second, high coverage of deciduous shrubs and tall mosses decreased the survival and size of rosettes. Obviously, the viability of populations can be enhanced by habitat amelioration. Population isolation and restricted recruitment and habitat specificity decrease the possibilities for environmental tracking. Further, overgrowth will decrease the availability of growing space inside the populations. Consequently, the long term survival of southern populations in Arnica largely depends on both the ability of species to adapt consequences of changing temperature regimes and the speed of habitat deterioration.

Observing copepods through a genomic lens	FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY												Background: Copepods outnumber every other multicellular animal group. They are critical components of the world's freshwater and marine ecosystems, sensitive indicators of local and global climate change, key ecosystem service providers, parasites and predators of economically important aquatic animals and potential vectors of waterborne disease. Copepods sustain the world fisheries that nourish and support human populations. Although genomic tools have transformed many areas of biological and biomedical research, their power to elucidate aspects of the biology, behavior and ecology of copepods has only recently begun to be exploited. Discussion: The extraordinary biological and ecological diversity of the subclass Copepoda provides both unique advantages for addressing key problems in aquatic systems and formidable challenges for developing a focused genomics strategy. This article provides an overview of genomic studies of copepods and discusses strategies for using genomics tools to address key questions at levels extending from individuals to ecosystems. Genomics can, for instance, help to decipher patterns of genome evolution such as those that occur during transitions from free living to symbiotic and parasitic lifestyles and can assist in the identification of genetic mechanisms and accompanying physiological changes associated with adaptation to new or physiologically challenging environments. The adaptive significance of the diversity in genome size and unique mechanisms of genome reorganization during development could similarly be explored. Genome-wide and EST studies of parasitic copepods of salmon and large EST studies of selected free-living copepods have demonstrated the potential utility of modern genomics approaches for the study of copepods and have generated resources such as EST libraries, shotgun genome sequences, BAC libraries, genome maps and inbred lines that will be invaluable in assisting further efforts to provide genomics tools for copepods. Summary: Genomics research on copepods is needed to extend our exploration and characterization of their fundamental biological traits, so that we can better understand how copepods function and interact in diverse environments. Availability of large scale genomics resources will also open doors to a wide range of systems biology type studies that view the organism as the fundamental system in which to address key questions in ecology and evolution.

European water cricket Velia caprai (Veliidae) overwinters concurrently in egg and adult stage in Central Europe. This rare overwintering strategy goes with longevity of this species. Adults can survive two winters in Central Europe, unlike other semiaquatic bugs. Scandinavian populations of V. caprai and water striders Gerris lacustris and G. lateralis were examined at the beginning and end of September to determine their life histories. Both gerrids start to overwinter during September, females prior to males and macropterous individuals prior to brachypterous. All females of G. lacustris and G. lateralis enter reproductive diapause before winter. V. caprai overwinters in both adult and egg stage in Norway, and can probably survive two winters. Central European and Scandinavian populations of V. caprai share the same unusual way of overwintering and probably also the whole life history.

Variation in hippocampal morphology along an environmental gradient: controlling for the effects of day length	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Environmental conditions may create increased demands for memory, which in turn may affect specific brain regions responsible for memory function. This may occur either via phenotypic plasticity or selection for individuals with enhanced cognitive abilities. For food-caching animals, in particular, spatial memory appears to be important because it may have a direct effect on fitness via their ability to accurately retrieve food caches. Our previous studies have shown that caching animals living in more harsh environments (characterized by low temperatures, high snow cover and short day lengths) possess more neurons within a larger hippocampus (Hp), a part of the brain involved in spatial memory. However, the relative role of each of these environmental features in the relationship is unknown. Here, we dissociate the effects of one theoretically important factor (day length) within the environmental severity/Hp relationship by examining food-caching birds (black-capped chickadee, Poecile atricapillus) selected at locations along the same latitude, but with very different climatic regimes. There was a significant difference in Hp attributes among populations along the same latitude with very different climatic features. Birds from the climatically mild location had significantly smaller Hp volumes and fewer Hp neurons than birds from the more harsh populations, even though all populations experienced similar day lengths. These results suggest that variables such as temperature and snow cover seem to be important even without the compounding effect of reduced day length at higher latitudes and suggest that low temperature and snow cover alone may be sufficient to generate high demands for memory and the hippocampus. Our data further confirmed that the association between harsh environment and the hippocampus in food-caching animals is robust across a large geographical area and across years.																	0962-8452					SEP 7	2011	278	1718					2662	2667		10.1098/rspb.2010.2585								WOS:000293142200015	21288947

Sex Chromosome Mosaicism and Hybrid Speciation among Tiger Swallowtail Butterflies	PLOS GENETICS												Hybrid speciation, or the formation of a daughter species due to interbreeding between two parental species, is a potentially important means of diversification, because it generates new forms from existing variation. However, factors responsible for the origin and maintenance of hybrid species are largely unknown. Here we show that the North American butterfly Papilio appalachiensis is a hybrid species, with genomic admixture from Papilio glaucus and Papilio canadensis. Papilio appalachiensis has a mosaic phenotype, which is hypothesized to be the result of combining sex-linked traits from P. glaucus and P. canadensis. We show that P. appalachiensis' Z-linked genes associated with a cooler thermal habitat were inherited from P. canadensis, whereas its W-linked mimicry and mitochondrial DNA were inherited from P. glaucus. Furthermore, genome-wide AFLP markers showed nearly equal contributions from each parental species in the origin of P. appalachiensis, indicating that it formed from a burst of hybridization between the parental species, with little subsequent backcrossing. However, analyses of genetic differentiation, clustering, and polymorphism based on molecular data also showed that P. appalachiensis is genetically distinct from both parental species. Population genetic simulations revealed P. appalachiensis to be much younger than the parental species, with unidirectional gene flow from P. glaucus and P. canadensis into P. appalachiensis. Finally, phylogenetic analyses, combined with ancestral state reconstruction, showed that the two traits that define P. appalachiensis' mosaic phenotype, obligatory pupal diapause and mimicry, evolved uniquely in P. canadensis and P. glaucus, respectively, and were then recombined through hybridization to form P. appalachiensis. These results suggest that natural selection and sex-linked traits may have played an important role in the origin and maintenance of P. appalachiensis as a hybrid species. In particular, ecological barriers associated with a steep thermal cline appear to maintain the distinct, mosaic genome of P. appalachiensis despite contact and occasional hybridization with both parental species.

NOCTURNAL PROVISIONING BY SWAINSON'S THRUSH	WILSON JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												We studied Swainson's Thrush (Catharus ustulatus) at two study areas of different latitudes to examine if parents provisioned their nestlings beyond daylight hours. We viewed 591 hrs of video from 37 nests. All nests were provisioned outside the dawn to dusk period but provisioning also continued through the night at the northern site. Night provisioners made an average (+/- SE) of 1.55 +/- 0.18 fewer provisioning trips/hr during the pre-dawn to late evening periods compared to non-night provisioners. Night provisioners compensated with two additional trips/hr during the postdusk period and 2.11(95% CI: 1.61-2.77) trips/hr during the night period. Night provisioners did not experience improved reproductive success, which supports our conclusion that night provisioning was compensatory rather than 'bonus' energy. Nocturnal provisioning was best explained by increased day length, which corresponded to increased light levels during the night period that enabled parents to navigate and locate food. Swainson's Thrush extend a given provisioning effort over more hours as light levels permit rather than increasing energy delivery to their nestlings, which may provide time and energy for other activities.

A. & D. Love	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1. This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Pseudorchis albida (Small White Orchid) that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to abiotic and biotic factors, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history, and conservation. 2. Pseudorchis albida is a native British herb growing in several plant communities of semi-natural habitats, typically in recently burned heather moorlands, upland well-drained pastures and meadows, and cliff ledges. Although the species is able to tolerate a wide range of ecological conditions from mildly acid to base-rich soils, it is limited mainly to open, short and nutrient-poor stands. Typical British plant communities include Calluna vulgaris heathlands, Anthoxanthum odoratum - Geranium sylvaticum hay meadows, and Nardus grasslands. The species often grows in transitions from heath to grass-dominated communities. The ecology of P. albida in the northern acidic environments is poorly understood. 3. Pseudorchis albida is a perennial geophyte whose populations are maintained predominantly by sexual reproduction, as vegetative spread is limited. The main perennating organ is a highly divided root tuber, which is completely replaced every year. Dormancy - the failure of above-ground parts to appear in a growing season, followed by reappearance of full-sized photosynthetic plants in subsequent seasons - has been observed and typically lasts for one, sometimes 2 years. The adventitious roots and distal parts of the root tuber are colonized by basidiomycetes from the family Tulasnellaceae. 4. The species is pollinated by crepuscular pyralid and pterophorid moths, most likely attracted by the sweet scent. During the day, pollinia can be also transferred by dance flies (Empididae). The breeding system of P. albida is poorly known but high fruit set, often over 90%, raises the possibility of spontaneous autogamy, particularly in arctic-alpine areas. The probability of flowering in consecutive years in P. albida is strongly influenced by cost of flowering and fruiting. 5. Pseudorchis albida has suffered a significant decline in distribution in Britain and other European countries. In Britain, it has been lost from more than 65% of its historical sites, particularly in lowland areas. The main causal factors are the cessation of traditional agricultural practices, habitat fragmentation and disturbance associated with housing and road construction, and agricultural improvement, including reclamation, fertilization and overgrazing. Conservation of remnant populations primarily depends on the maintenance of a short turf by extensive grazing, controlled burning and shrub cutting to promote flowering of adult plants and seedling recruitment.

JOURNAL OF HEREDITY												The adaptive potential of the northernmost Pinus sylvestris L. (and other northern tree) populations is considered by examining first the current patterns of quantitative genetic adaptive traits, which show high population differentiation and clines. We then consider the postglacial history of the populations using both paleobiological and genetic data. The current patterns of diversity at nuclear genes suggest that the traces of admixture are mostly visible in mitochondrial DNA variation patterns. There is little evidence of increased diversity due to admixture between an eastern and western colonization lineage, but no signal of reduced diversity (due to sequential bottlenecks) either. Quantitative trait variation in the north is not associated with the colonizing lineages. The current clines arose rapidly and may be based on standing genetic variation. The initial phenotypic response of Scots pine in the north is predicted to be increased survival and growth. The genetic responses are examined based on quantitative genetic predictions of sustained selection response and compared with earlier simulation results that have aimed at more ecological realism. The phenotypic responses of increased growth and survival reduce the opportunity for selection and delay the evolutionary responses. The lengthening of the thermal growing period also causes selection on the critical photoperiod in the different populations. Future studies should aim at including multiple ecological and genetic factors in evaluating potential responses.

Connecting the sun to flowering in sunflower adaptation	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Species living in seasonal environments often adaptively time their reproduction in response to photoperiod cues. We characterized the expression of genes in the flowering-time regulatory network across wild populations of the common sunflower, Helianthus annuus, that we found to be adaptively differentiated for photoperiod response. The observed clinal variation was associated with changes at multiple hierarchical levels in multiple pathways. Paralogue-specific changes in FT homologue expression and tissue-specific changes in SOC1 homologue expression were associated with loss and reversal of plasticity, respectively, suggesting that redundancy and modularity are gene network characteristics easily exploited by natural selection to produce evolutionary innovation. Distinct genetic mechanisms contribute to convergent evolution of photoperiod responses within sunflower, suggesting regulatory network architecture does not impose strong constraints on the evolution of phenotypic plasticity.

J	Wilson, MT; Mier, KL; Dougherty, A				Wilson, Matthew T.; Mier, Kathryn L.; Dougherty, Annette			The first annulus of otoliths: a tool for studying intra-annual growth of walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma)	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												We quantified the growing season of yearling walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) and related it to annual cycles of water temperature and day length. The study was restricted to members of the 2000 year class and thereby controlled for inter-annual variability. Juveniles were sampled from the year class during 10 cruises in the western Gulf of Alaska (GOA). Fifty percent of juveniles exhibited an annulus on 16 March 2001 (+/- 11 days 95% confidence interval). No regional difference was detected in the timing of annulus formation or in post-annulus growth trajectories. A model, derived from growth trajectories, estimated that the growing season lasted 204 days (22 March to 13 October 2001) and that growth rate peaked at 0.59 mm day(-1) on 2 July 2001. Growth rate increased with day length and water temperature during spring and decreased in late summer possibly due to thermal stress. Secondarily, we explored the utility of otolith size at the first annulus as a natural tag to identify nursery area, but this potential was curtailed by overlap in length among regions. Our results indicate that the first annulus can be used to advance our understanding of climate forcing on marine fish growth by providing fine temporal resolution of the growing season.																	0378-1909					SEP	2011	92	1					53	63		10.1007/s10641-011-9815-1								WOS:000293958000005

H. Gross (Polygonaceae), is an annual vine from Asia that has invaded the eastern US where it can form dense monocultures and outcompete other vegetation in a variety of habitats. The host-specific Asian weevil Rhinoncomimus latipes Korotyaev (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) was first released in the US in 2004 as part of a classical biological control program. The weevil was intensively monitored in three release arrays over 4 years, and field cages at each site were used to determine the number of generations produced. The weevil established at all three sites and produced three to four generations before entering a reproductive diapause in late summer. Weevils dispersed at an average rate of 1.5-2.9 m wk(-1) through the 50 m diameter arrays, which had fairly contiguous mile-a-minute cover. Weevils dispersing in the broader, more variable landscape located both large monocultures and small isolated patches of mile-a-minute 600-760 m from the release within 14 months. Weevil density ranged from fewer than 10 to nearly 200 weevils m(-2) mile-a-minute weed. Mile-a-minute cover decreased at the site with the highest weevil density. The production of P. perfoliata seed clusters decreased with increasing weevil populations at two sites, and seedling production declined over time at two sites by 75% and 87%. The ability of the weevil to establish, produce multiple generations per season, disperse to new patches, and likelihood of having an impact on plants in the field suggests that R. latipes has the potential to be a successful biological control agent.

To determine temperature effects on diapause duration of P. ussuriensis eggs, the rates of embryonic development and hatching were compared at various temperatures conditions by measuring embryonic stages and egg weights. Most eggs stayed in a very young stage (blastoderm formation, stage 4) when reared at 15 and 20 degrees C, 10-30% eggs developed into middle or late stages when reared at 25 degrees C, and most embryos developed fully (stage 23/24) when reared at 30 degrees C. Egg weight at 30 degrees C was 1.5 times higher than those reared at 20 degrees C. Chilling induced hatching in embryos at stage 23/24. Chilling caused stage 4 embryos to develop into stage 24, but they failed to hatch in response to a second warm period. Thus, P. ussuriensis eggs can overwinter either as young embryos (initial diapause) or as fully-developed embryos (final diapause). Eggs that experience an initial diapause oveminter again the second year in a final stage diapause. The post-diapause period was shorter when embryos overwintered in a final stage diapause. The hatching rate was highest in a temperature range of 7.5-15 degrees C. Our results suggest that temperature is an important environmental factor for the control of prolonged diapause in P. ussuriensis and initial diapause plays an important role in the control of its life cycle.

Global Distribution of Polaromonas Phylotypes - Evidence for a Highly Successful Dispersal Capacity	PLOS ONE												Bacteria from the genus Polaromonas are dominant phylotypes in clone libraries and culture collections from polar and high-elevation environments. Although Polaromonas has been found on six continents, we do not know if the same phylotypes exist in all locations or if they exhibit genetic isolation by distance patterns. To examine their biogeographic distribution, we analyzed all available, long-read 16S rRNA gene sequences of Polaromonas phylotypes from glacial and periglacial environments across the globe. Using genetic isolation by geographic distance analyses, including Mantel tests and Mantel correlograms, we found that Polaromonas phylotypes are globally distributed showing weak isolation by distance patterns at global scales. More focused analyses using discrete, equally sampled distances classes, revealed that only two distance classes (out of 12 total) showed significant spatial structuring. Overall, our analyses show that most Polaromonas phylotypes are truly globally distributed, but that some, as yet unknown, environmental variable may be selecting for unique phylotypes at a minority of our global sites. Analyses of aerobiological and genomic data suggest that Polaromonas phylotypes are globally distributed as dormant cells through high-elevation air currents; Polaromonas phylotypes are common in air and snow samples from high altitudes, and a glacial-ice metagenome and the two sequenced Polaromonas genomes contain the gene hipA, suggesting that Polaromonas can form dormant cells.

Transformations, transport, and potential unintended consequences of high sulfur inputs to Napa Valley vineyards	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Unintended anthropogenic deposition of sulfur (S) to forest ecosystems has a range of negative consequences, identified through decades of research. There has been far less study of purposeful S use in agricultural systems around the world, including the application of elemental sulfur (S(0)) as a quick-reacting fungicide to prevent damage to crops. Here we report results from a three-year study of the transformations and flows of applied S0 in soils, vegetation, and hydrologic export pathways of Napa Valley, CA vineyards, documenting that all applied S is lost from the vineyard ecosystem on an annual basis. We found that S0 oxidizes rapidly to sulfate (SO(4)(2-)) on the soil surface where it then accumulates over the course of the growing season. Leaf and grape tissues accounted for only 7-13% of applied S whereas dormant season cover crops accounted for 4-10% of applications. Soil S inventories were largely SO(4)(2-) and ester-bonded sulfates; they decreased from 1,623 +/- 354 kg ha(-1) during the dry growing season to 981 +/- 526 kg ha(-1) (0-0.5 m) during the dormant wet season. Nearly all S applied to the vineyard soils is transported offsite in dissolved oxidized forms during dormant season rainstorms. Thus, the residence time of reactive S is brief in these systems, and largely driven by hydrology. Our results provide new insight into how S use in vineyards constitutes a substantial perturbation of the S cycle in Northern California winegrowing regions and points to the unintended consequences that agricultural S use may have at larger scales.																	0027-8424					AUG 23	2011	108	34					14005	14010		10.1073/pnas.1110741108								WOS:000294163500034	21825150

Woven-fibered bone tissue in the smallest specimens indicates rapid growth rates during early ontogeny. Later ontogeny is marked by parallel-fibered tissue, suggesting reduced growth rates approaching skeletal maturity. Bone microstructure similarities between the ornithopods and theropods, including the presence of LAGs in each group, suggest there is no osteohistologic evidence supporting the hypothesis that polar theropods hibernated seasonally. Results instead suggest high-latitude dinosaurs had growth trajectories similar to their lower-latitude relatives and thus, rapid early ontogenetic growth and the cyclical suspensions of growth inherent in the theropod and ornithopod lineages enabled them to successfully exploit polar regions.																	1932-6203					AUG 3	2011	6	8							e23339	10.1371/journal.pone.0023339								WOS:000293558900076	21826250					
J	Sholes, ODV				Sholes, Owen D. V.			Consequences of Narrow Temperature Tolerance for a Pinyon Pine Sawfly, Neodiprion edulicolus	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												Temperate insect species are predicted to fare better in the face of climate change, because of their wider temperature tolerance, than are tropical species. Predictions are less certain, however, for temperate species with narrow temperature optima. Larvae of the sawfly Neodiprion edulicolus Ross are susceptible to cold weather and rarely occur above 1,900 m elevation near Sunset Crater, AZ, even though their host trees ( Pinus edulis Englemann) are abundant up to 2,300 m. During 12 yr of monitoring, the population of sawflies below 1,850 m declined significantly in years when April minimum temperatures were either unusually low or unusually high. Sawfly larvae transferred to host trees above 1,900 m were unable to sustain populations despite abundant host trees and high survival of transferred larvae. Cold temperatures delayed and thereby disrupted the sawfly life cycle. Overall, limited temperature tolerance of N. edulicolus larvae was the most likely cause of the decline of this sawfly population between 1994 and 2006. If April minimum temperatures continue to rise on average and interannual variation remains the same, the frequency of suboptimal high temperatures will increase. Soon, N. edulicolus, along with other species with narrow temperature optima, may be forced to disperse, adapt exceptionally quickly, or face extinction.																	0046-225X					AUG	2011	40	4					777	781		10.1603/EN10318								WOS:000294113300004	22251677
