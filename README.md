g01-metaanalysis

In this project I  want to correlate physiological variability with environmental variability. First, I calculated variability of winter arrival based on climate stations data (GHCN daily dataset by NOAA, downloaded 09.01.2018, version below). this is the folder 01 climate_data.
I then identified studies that measure day length responses of invertebrates. I extracted the slopes of the day length responses for each population of each study (folder 02 studies).
I then correlated the climate data with physiological data (folder 03 analysis). see individual readme files in subfolders.

GHCN version:
The current version of GHCN Daily is 3.22-upd-2018010905 (i.e, an update that started at 2018010905 [yyyymmddhh] UTC; yyyy=year; mm=month; dd=day; hh=hour),
created by appending recently available data updates to the last fully reprocessed version: 3.22-por-2017123017.
