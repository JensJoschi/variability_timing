In this project I  want to correlate physiological variability with environmental variability. First, I calculated variability and predictability of winter arrival based on climate stations data (GHCN daily dataset by NOAA). this is the folder 01 climate_data.
I then identified studies that measure day length responses of invertebrates. I extracted the slopes of the day length responses for each population of each study (folder 02 studies).
I then correlated the climate data with physiological data (folder 03 analysis). 

A full description of the methods can be found in the file methods.md. See also individual readme files in subfolders.
