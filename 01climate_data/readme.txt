the folder "01 raw" contains the raw GHCN climate stations data "ghcnd_all.tar" (actually, this is not uploaded to github but can be found at NOAA.gov). I use this data in the folder "02 processing/001 data conversion" and convert it to a delimited .txt file with only daily temperature averages.
The .R scripts in the folder "02 processing/002 calculation_predictability" then calculate climate variability in various ways, and save the R workspace in the folder "03 output".
