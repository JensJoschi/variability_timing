the folder "01 raw" contains the raw GHCN climate stations data "ghcnd_all.tar" (actually, this is not uploaded to github but can be found at NOAA.gov). I use this data in the folder "02 processing/001 data conversion" and convert it with the PERL script "conversion.py" to a delimited .txt file with only daily temperature averages ("converted.txt", not included).
The .R script read_rawdata.rmd in the folder "02 processing/002 calculation_predictability" then loads the converted.txt file, merges it with other climate station data from the NOAA server, and saves the workspace ("RWorkspace.RData"). The other scripts in the subfolders of 002 calculation_predictability use this workspace to calculate climate variability in various ways, and save the final R workspace in the folder "03 output".
